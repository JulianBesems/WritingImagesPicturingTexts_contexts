After filtering to English and a minimum of 2000 words, a total number of 1,100,990 documents was compiled. All documents were normalised from .pdf or .epub formats to plain UTF-8 .txt. For this the PyMuPDF and EbookLib libraries were relied on. Through this process all other information like page nrs, layout and images are lost. This was done for two reasons, first of all the storage required for 1.1M texts in their original file format was not feasable, thus all documents were immediately converted and stored as .txt files only, still leading to a total combined size of 0.7TB. The other reason is that as an operative instrument of writing and picturing, for the purpose of establishing a public text domain that serves as a generic screen for the multi-modal projections, the other aspects of the books or articles are not required. The intention is not to read any of these documents in a conventional matter, nor retrieve them in full. Instead we are interested in creating a digital substrate, for which the normalisation of data-format forms the first step to facilitate the operability of this TEXT domain.
