The interior atmosphere of a space affects us greatly, and if we don\u2019t get enough light, we fall ill. The fact that the colour on the walls alters when a cloud passes over the sun and looks different throughout the day or even across the seasons is what makes the paint feel alive. It is this quality that gives an interior a unique sense of depth and atmosphere. But even under dullyovercast conditions the light has an incandescent quality, seemingly brighter than intuition would allow.", "suggested_query": "The architects choice of materials and the way he uses light also contribute to the creation of a sense of space. For example, the use of a single, unbroken line of glass along the facade creates the illusion of a larger interior volume, while the subtle variation in tone and texture of the walls creates a sense of intimacy. The effect is almost three-dimensional, as if the space is shifting and changing as one moves through it.", "suggest_context": "The architects decision to use clear glass and to splash only a few precise places with touches of colour corresponds to his wish to keep a tight rein on the use of light  a primordial element in the definition of the interior volumes.
