01. "Reading in my hut one autumn evening, the sudden sound of a pomegranate cracking open riveted my attention.

07. "In the Chicago frame buildings, the gradual increase in the size of the window challenged the traditional role of the wall with small openings. Though this increase in window size had been intended as a way of increasing the amount of light within the building, and therefore its rentable area, the proportional enlargement of the area of glass and in turn that of the window brought about a transformation of the wall itself, making the difference between the window and the wall ambiguous."[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]
