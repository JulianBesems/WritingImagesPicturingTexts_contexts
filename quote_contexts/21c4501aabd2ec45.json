MULTIMODALITY Where chapter 1 situated the thesis within architecture, this chapter will serve to formulate a perspective onto the primary condition that the thesis revolves around: multimodality. Before introducing the experimental setup, this chapter first reviews the current occurrences of multimodal relations between domains of information within computation and architecture. This will serve as the technical-theoretical basis upon which the experiments will reflect. As previously stated, the aim is not to prescribe applications for architectural representation, but to draw from how architects already work across modalities in order to frame digital multimodal models from an architectonic perspective.\n\n*In this context, multimodality refers to the capacity of digital tools and systems to operate across multiple modes of representation, such as text, image, video, and audio, as well as the ability of users to switch seamlessly between these modes. This fundamental characteristic of digital systems has been widely discussed within the fields of human-computer interaction, cognitive science, and linguistics, but has yet to be fully explored within the context of architectural representation and design. As a result, this chapter will seek to bridge this gap by examining the multimodal aspects of architectural information processing and communication, with a focus on the potential benefits and challenges that arise from the integration of multiple modalities in architectural design and representation.*", "suggested_query": "In this context, multimodality refers to the capacity of digital tools and systems to operate across multiple modes of representation, such as text, image, video, and audio, as well as the ability of users to switch seamlessly between these modes.
