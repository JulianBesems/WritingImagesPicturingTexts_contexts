    <div class="selected">For example, engraving a stone with the appropriate symbol, words, or figures when Mars was in the ascendancy would add the supposed warlike and courageous qualities of Mars to the similar powers already inherent in the stone.

<li>&quot;There was a long weekend in every month in which ‘the House would bleed’, business would be suspended, and much chocolate would be drunk. Fires would be lit in every room after nightfall , the raw flames visible in the windows and making it clear to all passers-by that the building’s blood was up. The occupants of the House tended to shut themselves in their rooms during bloody weekends. The pianoforte in the salon seemed ill-fitting, somehow. Frequently, in the red-lined room on the second floor up, Juliette, Rebecca, Fitz and (sometimes) Anji would sit together around a fire in an incense-bowl that was the only source of light.&quot;[Miles, Lawrence *The Adventuress of Henrietta Street (Doctor Who)*. BBC Books, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;Len always left the same residual impression in everybody — whenever you mentioned Len, they always lit up, and immediately you would hear stories that had some smack of eccentricity. He created such an amazing visual environment. When he set the table it would have some little extra layout to it that no one would have thought of but him. On a winter’s night when Len would light a ﬁre it would be like a huge celebration, it would be like the ﬁrst ﬁre anybody had ever lit, and we just had to watch it.&quot;[Horrocks, Roger *Len Lye: A Biography*. Auckland University Press, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;The throne room, still preserved in the ruins of Knossos tells the story best. Minos, the king, sat on a throne as one would expect, a majestic throne with a high back and a seat thoughtin fully curved to tedly on flat bottom. His councillors also his exalted fit sat, backless benches along the walls— but the point admit- is, they Such an action would have been inconceivable in any of the royal assemblies of the Near East or Egypt.&quot;[Kemper, Rachel H. *A History of Costume*.

<li>&quot;It was a tribute to France’s commerce and empire, one that Auguste Bartholdi would soon learn to emulate. Eventually, he would even develop a taste for colorful materials, for metals and stones like those used by Hittorff.&quot;[Viano, Francesca Lidia *Sentinel: The Unlikely Origins of the Statue of Liberty*.

Fundamental Considerations 37 farther ones would be represented in gradually diminishing bulk. The shadows cast would be different, and their lack of uniformity would reveal the unreality of the composition, not to speak of confusion and obscurity, which must accompany such a design in high relief. In low relief one does not run this danger, because all the shadows are equally suppressed.&quot;[Von Mach, Edmund, and Parkstone Press *Greek Sculpture its Spirit and its Principles*.

<li>&quot;These states, backed by the new ocean-going technologies represented by the galleon, were embarking on a dialogue with the rest of the world that would make them rich as never before and ultimately overturn the balance of power in Europe. Sailing in ships like this gilded galleon, they would encounter kingdoms and empires around the world whose sophistication dazzled them, with whom they would trade, whom they would often misunderstand and some of whom they would ultimately destroy. Those ocean-going expeditions have in large measure shaped the world we live in today.&quot;[MacGregor, Neil *A History of the World in 100 Objects*. Penguin Group US, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;If anything, the transparency of the statue recalled images of death and resurrection. Later, however, when the statue would start taking shape in the Monduit workshop in Paris, all red in her copper garb, her connections with the French winegrowers would become clearer.&quot;[Viano, Francesca Lidia *Sentinel: The Unlikely Origins of the Statue of Liberty*. Harvard University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;His design called for the car to be fitted with the richest, most comfortable upholstery available and a sturdy pneumatically sealing airtight door. Then he was struck with a truly inspired idea. Realizing that his subway needed a waiting room, and that the waiting room was where passengers would form their first vital impressions of the subway, Beach laid out plans for a 120-by-14-foot room that would be as elegant as the finest room in the most expensive New York hotel. Its features included a crystal chandelier, fine paintings, a grand piano, and a huge fountain filled with goldfish—all beneath the city.&quot;[Sandler, Martin W. *Lost to Time*.

<li>&quot;A red tailcoat would attract attention worn in the ballroom, therefore a red tailcoat is not the modern style for the ballroom. A top hat would attract attention when ice-skating. Among the best people, to attract attention to oneself is considered vulgar. This principle, however, cannot be adhered to everywhere. With a coat that would be perfectly inconspicuous worn in Hyde Park, one would certainly attract attention to oneself in Peking or Zanzibar.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*.

<li>&quot;Bishop,’ and I make it a point to decline all invitations from people I don’t know. ” PARLOR MUSIC and dancing had become one of London’s most popular pastimes. Someone would sit at the piano, while four couples would stand in a square formation, with each couple occupying a separate corner of the imaginary quadrangle. The pianist would play, and the dance—called a quadrille—would commence. The couples would take turns dancing in the center of the square, sometimes exchanging partners.&quot;[Reel, Monte *Between Man and Beast: An Unlikely Explorer, the Evolution Debates, and the African Adventure that Took the Victorian World by Storm*.

<li>&quot;This would be a fully immersive, interactive Steampunk exposition that shows what rooms in a Steampunk house would have looked like if the creators of the 1876 Centennial Exposition had predicted accurately what technologies and modern conveniences would have been integrated into our homes, fashion, and design—but within the Victorian and Industrial aesthetic of the period. The majority of the objects would be authentic to the Victorian/Industrial period in one way or another and transformed by infusing modern technology functionality into the pieces.&quot;[Vandermeer, Jeff, and Desirina Boskovich *The Steampunk User’s Manual: An Illustrated Practical and Whimsical Guide to Creating Retro-Futurist Dreams*.

<li>&quot;By 1920 they had taken a forty-two-year lease on the site and were in the throes of erecting a six-story limestone-clad structure, in the style of the Italian Renaissance, to house a women’s specialty emporium called Avedon’s Fifth Avenue. The bible of the rag trade, The American Cloak and Suit Review, reported that the Carrara-marbled and mahogany-trimmed main floor would feature blouses; that the ivory-enameled five upper floors would be devoted, progressively, to dresses, suits and skirts, millinery, and furs; that, throughout, “buff colored carpets will contribute their soft richness to the general note of delicate charm”; and that the thirteen street-level display windows backed with Caen stone would scintillate at night with colored lights.&quot;[Stevens, Norma, and Steven M.

<li>&quot;recall with great satisfaction the many times on his veranda, look ing westward upon flood and hills beyond, in large discourse he would dwell upon the things unseen, and his utterances would have such depth and scope, that I marveled at the beauty and strength of that love for God and his realm which rose and fell like * mighty tides in his heart. Sometimes allusion would be made to his career and the honors that had thickened upon him a significant smile would steal over his face, and he would gently say It is all of God.&quot;[Prime, Samuel Irenaeus *The Life of Samuel F.B Morse-Inventor of the Electro-Magnetic Recording T*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;This gentleman was somewhat taken aback upon learning that we drove to Worcester almost weekly!When the holidays rolled around, the Lodge had a Christmas party. Somebody would bring a drum and we would do Round Dancing and Stomp Dancing throughout the house. The aquariums would shake and the windows would rattle and the music could be heard all over the neighborhood. Members brought special foods to share. Everyone brought their families – wives, husbands and children - it was a good family event. It became an annual, happily anticipated Christmas affair.&quot;[Bullock, Paul, and Harriett Bullock *Whirling Thunder : one man&#x27;s journey through Native America : the evolution of New England powwows 1940-2014*.

<li>&quot;One such object would be a metal spoon; the backside of the bowl makes a convex reflective—and therefore deflective—surface. A convex reflective surface causes light rays to diverge and would be much more appropriate for deflection than the other side of the spoon, the concave surface, which would bring light rays together. Metal spoons were one of the most common items at the southern New England burial grounds, with fifty-nine spoons recovered from thirty-nine burials at the West Ferry, RI-1000, Burr’s Hill, and Pantigo cemeteries.&quot;[Shrum, Rebecca K. *In the Looking Glass: Mirrors and Identity in Early America*.

<li>&quot;In the summer of 1948, for the stairwell on the promenade deck of the SS Argentina, Noguchi created Lunar Voyage, a wall of molded magnesite with electric lights inserted into its crevices. “My idea was to create a completely artificial environment inside, the interstices from which light would emanate, so that one would, in a sense, be inside a sculpture. ” It was an impulse that he would return to in his later work. In March 1947 Noguchi took part in an exhibition called Bloodflames, organized by the Surrealist critic and poet Nicolas Calas for the Hugo Gallery at 26 East Fifty-seventh Street.&quot;[Herrera, Hayden *Listening to Stone: The Art and Life of Isamu Noguchi*.

<li>&quot;Mamuset would contain fifty UQs, or two hundred Utility Squares, in all. Utility Squares were to be storage areas. Each Utility Square would house the twenty-four sets of implements for its Sector’s Quad, along with water reserves, fodder, fertilizer, seeds, etc. Strings of solar panels situated on arbors above Utility Squares would charge banks of batteries for Street lamps. Streets were the ten-foot-wide, crisscrossing ways separating Squares. Mamuset would require no fences; each Square would have a Street on every side.&quot;[Sanders, Ron *Microcosmia*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Egyptian costume may have been much more inventive and varied than the tomb paintings and sculpture the study of Egyptian costume. Egyptian would suggest. The tomb of Tutankhamen also yielded a splendid corselet, a garment often shown on the monuments but never before recovered in actual form. Small enterprising wonder, since it is precisely the sort of thing an tomb robber would have gone after first.&quot;[Kemper, Rachel H. *A History of Costume*. A History of Costume, 1977.]</li>
<li>&quot;This was to be a formal presentation of a Victorian lady’s dressing sequence in all its layers, from the innermost intimate garments to the outer winter finery. I would be starting in a corset and pantalets (with modern panties underneath the latter to retain decency in front of an audience), and Gabriel would act as my “lady’s maid” while we explained each item subsequently layered over these. By the end, I would be dressed in a full winter visiting outfit, complete with cape and muff: a Victorian lady prepared to go calling.&quot;[Chrisman, Sarah A. *Victorian Secrets: What a Corset Taught Me about the Past, the Present, and Myself*.

<li>&quot;Premodern Europeans were expected to recognize a large cast of characters in painting, sculpture, and stained glass, from the saints—Saint Peter with his key, Saint Lucy with her eyes on a plate—to the graces, cardinal virtues, and deadly sins. Most churches would have some portion of the Bible translated into art; a particularly elaborate cathedral like Chartres would include such features as the Seven Liberal Arts and the Wise and Foolish Virgins as well as scenes from the life of Christ arranged symbolically.&quot;[Solnit, Rebecca *Wanderlust: A History of Walking*.

<li>&quot;Chief Gorai of the Shortland Islands would receive recruiting agents and ship&#x27;s officers resplendent in a naval belt, sword, silk top hat and a seaman&#x27;s jumper. His guests would be invited into his large wooden house to discuss business over a meal served European-style and eaten around a huge refectory table with damask tablecloth and a full set of silver cutlery.&quot;[Randell, Nigel *The White Headhunter: The Story of a 19-Century Sailor Who Survived a South Seas Heart of Darkness*.

<li>&quot;During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a display would contain the following items—dragons or similar figures issuing from the scenic castle provided for the display ; these would be moved by line rockets. A line rocket has no cap or garniture, the socket usually provided to hold the stick being lengthened, and of sufficient diameter to allow it to slide along a tightly stretched cord passed through it. Pieces of a similar nature to the modern fountain and gerb would be represented by &quot; ground rockets. &quot;&quot;[Brock, Alan St. H *Pyrotechnics: The History and Art of Firework Making*. D.
