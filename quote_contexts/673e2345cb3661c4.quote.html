    <pre>3.6 INTERACTIVITY Now that we&#x27;ve established the elements and projections we will rely on within the WIPT editor this chapter introduces the negotiations between all different domains that are foregrounded in the interaction with the multi-modal cast across all domains. Given the simple condition that a text editor is bound by text, and that a thesis which is the testing ground for this multi-modal cast is primarily expected within this domain as well, the primary focus of the interaction is mediated by the writing I am presenting here. However as mentioned the other direction from imagery to text will be explored in one of the experimental sub-chapters in chapter 4, although this will be done partially outside of the text editor. Therefore we will first present the active mediations that are implemented within the WIPT editor, and at the end of this chapter we will briefly showcase the nature of the inverse direction.

<em>The active mediations implemented within the WIPT editor are primarily based on the notion of a shared workspace, where the different domains are interconnected and influence each other through a dynamic feedback loop. This shared workspace is the primary mediator of the interaction, allowing for the seamless integration of text, images, and other modalities. As a result, the negotiation between domains is not a linear process, but rather a recursive one, where each domain informs and is informed by the others.</em></pre>

    <div class="selected">It is now time to summarize the lessons learned from the first chapter of the book. From my perspective the main purpose with this chapter was to establish a conceptual platform for one of the core concepts for this book, i. e. “interaction”. Since interaction is one critical concept, not only for this book, but for this emergent field of interactive architecture and the texturing of information technologies into our built environments it has been somewhat crucial to pay some extra attention to this concept.[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

<li>&quot;Each interface provided a different form of visualization of and interaction with the geometric shapes. The temporally-stacked interface (Fig. 16. 8, right) employed a temporal model, providing users with a geometric shape at a time and allowing them to directly manipulate it to morph it from one form to another. The transitional changes to the visualizations were communicated in one location. The spatiallydistributed interface (Fig. 16. 8, left) employed a spatial model, providing users with a relational map of a set of geometric shapes and allowing them to navigate the map by clicking on links that would animate how one shape morphs and becomes Fig.&quot;[Zudilova-Seinstra, Elena, Tony Adriaansen, Robert van Liere (auth.), Robert Liere, Tony Adriaansen, and Elena Zudilova-Seinstra (eds.) *Trends in Interactive Visualization: State-of-the-Art Survey*.

<li>&quot;All actions are supported by visual feedback embedded in a common frame of reference. The Multimod Application Framework (MAF) [31] allows the development of multimodal visualization applications based on VTK and other specialized libraries. It provides high level components that can be easily combined to develop a visualization application in various scientific areas. Interaction inside MAF is accomplished by processing input events coming from both GUIs and interaction devices. MAF supports both 2D and 3D input and allows multiple device implementations.&quot;[Zudilova-Seinstra, Elena, Tony Adriaansen, Robert van Liere (auth.), Robert Liere, Tony Adriaansen, and Elena Zudilova-Seinstra (eds.) *Trends in Interactive Visualization: State-of-the-Art Survey*.

<li>&quot;Re-representation: Affordances of Shared Models in Team-Based Design 67 Fig. 7 Hybrid media, physical objects with text narrative on a 2 × 2 We have observed that successful design projects employ many kinds of media-models, or have a broad bandwidth of media-models. This is because the varying kinds of media-models engender different kinds of thinking and different kinds of exploration. It is through the translation form one kind of media-model to another that insight is gained, and the project is moved forward.&quot;[Lindberg, Tilmann, Christoph Meinel, Ralf Wagner (auth.), Christoph Meinel, Larry Leifer, and Hasso Plattner (eds.) *Design Thinking: Understand – Improve – Apply*.

<li>&quot;The most important conclusion from this study is that different micro-level epistemic interactions in a tool can support and enhance different mental activities, each to different degrees of efficacy. 16. 5. 3 Transition In many tools, interaction with a visualization results in a change in the visual image – i. e. , a transition happening in the structure and form of the visualization. According to the interactivity framework, transitions in visualizations can be communicated using two distinct models: temporally-stacked or spatially-distributed.&quot;[Zudilova-Seinstra, Elena, Tony Adriaansen, Robert van Liere (auth.), Robert Liere, Tony Adriaansen, and Elena Zudilova-Seinstra (eds.) *Trends in Interactive Visualization: State-of-the-Art Survey*.

<li>&quot;PREDITOR and pdFab are both examples of such systems. The need for a common SWR has been recognized for some time. The FABRICS statistical process/device simulator [19][20][25][24] was one of the first TCAD systems to integrate multiple simulation models, and hence one of the first to have a common representation. The Process Engineer&#x27;s Workbench (PEW) [34][33] provided an interactive environment for quasi-three-dimensional process/device simulation using the FABRICS models, and was one of the first systems to use a centralized wafer state with a strong link to the mask artwork.&quot;[Lloyd, P., C.

<li>&quot;In those sessions the process is modeled by an expert using an software tool. Participants can see how the process evolves and participate by providing input. We argue that TBPM fosters another level of participation because the participants do not have to channel their input through a tool operator. Also, the direct interaction with the process creates a different notion of responsibility for the result. Nevertheless, Persson’s recommendations [12] serve as a good guideline for group modeling sessions.&quot;[Lindberg, Tilmann, Christoph Meinel, Ralf Wagner (auth.), Christoph Meinel, Larry Leifer, and Hasso Plattner (eds.) *Design Thinking: Understand – Improve – Apply*.

<li>&quot;This example with the clock is on the one hand a good example that illustrates the texturation approach as presented in this book. One the other hand, it is also a good example of how this complementary approach that integrates interaction design thinking with a perspective rooted in architecture as presented in this book can be of practical help for analyzing and understanding technology integration in context. This relate to a set of important messages in this book.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

<li>&quot;Thus, in terms of the Systems Design Framework, this chapter is primarily focussed upon the link between Phase 1 and Phase 2, as shown in Figure 8. 1. The hope was to extend our understanding of Distributed Cognition (Hutchins, 1995a) in highly automated driving systems. Method The work presented in this chapter is based upon an exploratory study by Banks and Stanton (2015b). Participants Two participants with Advanced Driver Training were recruited to take part in this study due to the exploratory nature of a highly automated prototype technology.&quot;[Banks, Victoria A., and Neville A.

<li>&quot;The P&amp;D Workbench (Process and Device simulation Workbench)[l] realizes an integrated process and device simulation environment on EWS in conjunction with several framework tools and server machines, thus facilitating the use of simulation in device technology developments. Fig. 1 shows the system configuration of P&amp;D Workbench. Besides the simulation programs, the system is composed of five framework tools; a data and job manager MEDLEY+ESCORT[2], an interactive input data capture DAIJOBDA, a data-base for standard process recipes and simulation results, a graphic output processor VDP-CORE and a job/data transfer for server machines.&quot;[Lloyd, P., C.

<li>&quot;In each case, a distinctive and valuable kind of understanding is achieved when one can perceive them as providing different perspectives on one and the same item. I have been concerned here to say something about the hermeneutic process that leads from a text to a kind of understanding: the essentially dialogical capacity to navigate among different inferential perspectives on the conceptual contents deployed in the text. This, I claim, is the basic task of reading. But it should not be forgotten that there is a complementary hermeneutic process, which leads from that sort of implicit 118 Talking with a Tradition practical conceptual understanding to its explicit expression or codification in a text.&quot;[Brandom, Robert B. *Tales of the Mighty Dead: Historical Essays in the Metaphysics of Intentionality*.

<li>&quot;In their simulation model the evolved agents successfully acquired the capacity to discriminate between ‘live’ (interactive) and ‘recorded’ (one-way, non-interactive) relations. Dynamical systems analysis demonstrates that this capacity cannot be reduced to the isolated individual agent, but that the dynamics of the interaction process itself play an essential role in enabling this behavior. When the agent attempts to interact with a non-responsive ‘partner’ whose movements are merely played back from a recording of a previously highly successful encounter, the interaction fails to materialize.&quot;[(auth.), Shaun Gallagher *Phenomenology*.
