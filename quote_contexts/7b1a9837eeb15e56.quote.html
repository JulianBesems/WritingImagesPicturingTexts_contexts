      <li>&quot;&quot;Architecture. &quot;Photo by Art Siegel. The illusion of spatial interpenetration is secured by superimposing two photographic negatives. The next generation will perhops really see buildings like this, when glass and compressed air architecture develops. Openings and boundaries, perforations and moving surfaces, carry the periphery to the center, and push the center outward.

<li>&quot;Conversely, architecture as a discipline focuses on the permanence of the architectural object and the myth of its perfectability. DeLanda’s synthetic understanding of cities is inherently destabilizing to architecture because it elevates material factors to the same level as cultural production. The current fascination with fluidity may serve as a catalyst toward a new understanding of architectural processes. However, the preoccupation with representations of fluidity as built form restricts us to rigidly conventional architectural discourse.&quot;[James, Vincent, and Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;A contemporary building is increasingly heterogeneous and likely to include materials and systems from three or more continents. When architectural innovation is confined to the image of a building, new technologies or materials are limited to their decorative effects. If our ideas about architecture remain fluid, then buildings can continually be reconceived relative to changing problems or conditions. While new technologies are starting to erode the limitations of standardization and enable more fluid and adaptive responses to material fabrication, our social and cultural habits of design create a barrier to greater innovation.&quot;[James, Vincent, and Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;As Caygill further points out, echoing Benjamin, architecture provides the main site for the interaction of technology and human sensorium through touch and use. “It is both a condition and object of experience, the speculative site of emergence of the ‘technological physis’. ”62 And further: “As the locus of modern experience, architecture both establishes the parameters of perception in space and time while being itself subject to constant transformation. ”63 Caygill offers a pertinent extension of Benjamin’s speculation on architecture, one which could speak to a reconfiguration of its practice which has thus far failed to inaugurate a new experience within the current form of technology and has therefore abdicated its political responsibility.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;This is a unique niche for an architectural firm, to say the least. We seek to fold in the design, construction, simulation, and presentation of virtual constructs and their environments by recreating various physical phenomena—such as artificial and natural light dynamics, specific qualities of physical materials and landscapes, and the precise behaviors of wind and heat upon a structure and its environment. This medium is not well understood within the discipline of architecture. It’s often thought of as an after-the-fact tool for representation or image-making, overlooking its generative capacity for designing, testing, and substantiating digital form- and space-making.&quot;[Kedan, Elite, Jon Dreyfous, and Craig Mutter *Provisional: Emerging Modes of Architectural Practice USA*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;In other words: to the untrained eye, sculpture may appear as architecture, and a work of architecture as enlarged sculpture (Fig. 38). The latter was almost always the case with classical architecture, where the modulation of masses and bodies (volumes) was predominant. But space creation in our time has changed the meaning of architecture. A brief explanation may clarify this. If the side walls of a volume (i. e. , a clearly circumscribed body) are scattered in different direc• A valuable theoretical study, perhaps the most valuable of recent years, on the question of architecture, is the book by S. Giedion: &quot;Bouen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisenbeton, Bauen in Eisen” (Verlog Klinkhardt &amp; Biermonn, Leipzig).&quot;[Moholy-Nagy, László *The New Vision and Abstract of an Artist*. New York: Wittenborn, Schultz, Inc., 1947.]</li>
<li>&quot;The purely formal approach to the architecture of a certain region is fundamentally incorrect, and simply must lead to incorrect connections and conclusions. Because, in the framework of the aforementioned approach, the question is 10 Introduction never posed as to why at a certain, sometimes very precisely definable point in, time the commission was given to apply certain building forms and schemes, the illusion is created that the one architectural form would have more or less autonomically developed itself from the other one analogous to natural evolution.&quot;[Mekking, Aart J.J., and Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>

<li>&quot;Apart from those aspects of building that are subject to physical laws, architecture is actually nothing more than a proposal to see reality in a certain way, using specific building elements related to the variables form, material and function. Although certain combinations of building elements and their meanings are often presented as traditions fixed in time and space, they are by definition subject to change because the representations themselves are intrinsically subjective, just as form, material and function are all put to subjective use.&quot;[Mekking, Aart J.J., and Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Such a critical strategy is indeed needed to address the import of material and technique for form in architecture. The fallacies of technological determinism are avoided when the now of the present attains its materiality by the difference maintained through recollection of the culture of building. 53 There is another dimension to any historicization of current architecture: even those who would like to read current architecture merely in terms of ‘surface’ are indeed opting for an idea of construction that is implied in the architecture of the tent.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;One could reiterate Meyer’s reflections on the relationship between the roof and the enclosure and argue for the importance of construction for the present architecture. This discussion also entails the specificity of the conversion of matter into form; although mediatic techniques have opened a different perceptual field, architectural form is still realized through techniques that can transform historical style into constructive style. Here I would like to draw two conclusions from my excursion into Benjamin’s notes on construction.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Giedion attempts to show thot in modern construction the correct application of materials and principles of economy is that which produces the actual architectural creation. But he also says that material and construction are only means to the realization of architecturally envisioned ends. His latest book “ Space, Time and Architecture” (Harvard University Press, 1941) is once more an important and excellent contribution. 60 tions, spatial patterns or spatial relations originate. This fact is the best guide to judgment of modern and pseudo-modern architecture.&quot;[Moholy-Nagy, László *The New Vision and Abstract of an Artist*. New York: Wittenborn, Schultz, Inc., 1947.]</li>
<li>&quot;If we really want to find a tool for sorting out the global built environment, we should stop inventing decontextualised series of regional and periodical styles, and start focusing on the basic representational themes as they have been included in buildings worldwide by their actual producers. ’’ STRUCTURING CHAOS: RECURRENT THEMES AND REVOLVING TRADITIONS IN ARCHITECTURE In Chapter 1, Aart Mekking continues with these ideas and establishes a consistent paradigm with which to methodologically ‘attack’ the seeming chaos of the world’s built environment.&quot;[Mekking, Aart J.J., and Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;When Gadamer writes that architecture “shapes”, “frees” space, the space to which he refers is above all that of the living world. “The Artwork in Word and Image” reminds in this sense, that architecture has an effect on “the whole surrounding world in which human life plays itself out” (1993c, 397; 2007, 222). To cite Harries Karsten, we could therefore speak of an ethical function of architecture, which simultaneously takes on meaning in a political sense, since a given architecture organises or disposes of a certain common ethos (2000), and precludes other ethical options.&quot;[(eds.), Bruce B. Janz *Place, Space and Hermeneutics*. Springer International Publishing, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;In contrast, artist Constant Niewenhuys’s New Babylon was conceived as an imaginary urban web where architecture acts only as infrastructure. His experiment suggests an alternative: the triumph of a single urban organism devoid of the bounded architectural project. 2 In New Babylon, all architects, except one, are banished, and design is relegated to interiorized ambiences and the temporal field where social activity takes place and boundaries are dissolved. New Babylon also anticipated many of the realities of the contemporary city that undermine conventional ideas about architecture.&quot;[James, Vincent, and Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*.
