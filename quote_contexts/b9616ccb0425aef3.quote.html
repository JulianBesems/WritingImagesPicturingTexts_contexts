      <li>&quot;0. 52–0. 67 m. Wall 3004 is a short wall between Doorways A and H that separates Room 303 from Room 305 to the south. The wall itself is formed of three stacked-boulder pillars connected by units of wall consisting of two rows of cobblestones (Fig. 7. 6). 14 The wall is preserved to a height of 0. 56–0. 74 m and measures ca. 3. 00 m long. One boulder at the eastern end of Wall 3004 serves as the western frame of Doorway H and is coated with plaster (E54:56) on its vertical face.&quot;[Daviau, P. M. Michele, Paul-Eugene Dion, Ronald G.

<li>&quot;The western half of Wall C contains a ca. 16 m long fragment of a very specific wall structure (Wall C1, see Fig. 2), preserved in up to two stone courses of its regular masonry.

<li>&quot;The masonry exterior wall had some reinforcing steel in the wall, both vertically and horizontally. There was an apparent interior load-bearing wall that was not tied to the east exterior wall with reinforcing steel. There were vertical expansion and contraction joints in the wall at approximately 38 ft o. c. The horizontal reinforcing steel at these expansion joints was installed in sleeves to allow the expansion and contraction to occur.&quot;[Prevatt, David O., William Coulbourne, Andrew J.

<li>&quot;The east wall seen by Ittar and Dinsmoor is still visible above the south apse wall (PI. 10:a). At a lower level the original west wall of the area can be seen through the break in the south apse wall. It continues the line of the west wall of Room 2 south beyond the apse for 0. 56 m. before it is joined by the wall of a vaulted chamber extending to the southeast.&quot;[Biers, Jane C. *The Great Bath on the Lechaion Road (Corinth vol.17)*.

<li>&quot;• At the fa£ade of one building, there was a veneer-clad wing wall above a fourth floor terrace area. This wall was topped with coping stones, with the top of the wall angled downward toward the exterior. There was a concrete beam running along the top of the wall (below the coping and veneer). A coping stone was removed from this wall to observe the anchorage of the coping and the condition at the wall cavity.&quot;[(Editors), Paul A. Bosela 7 Norbert J.

<li>&quot;You can see the wall stretching a long way on both sides. This southern wall is nearly 2. 5 kms. The other three walls are much shorter, creating a half-hexagonal shape. The total perimeter of the fort is almost 6. 5 kms, and the wall in places rises more than twenty-five metres above the ground. The wall is punctuated by several bastions, curved outworks that provide a vantage point and cover for the wall itself.&quot;[Liddle, Swapna *Delhi 14: Historic walks*.
