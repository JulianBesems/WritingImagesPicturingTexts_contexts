The abstracted formulation of transformation between domains and their relations is of direct interest to the research question, and possibly offers a means to technologically explore this further by implementing monads on domains of architectural communication. Familiarity with monads was gained through programming in Haskell, a pure functional language, as part of a full year course within a Computing Science bachelor. Further experience was gained by implementing the monad structure within Mathematica as an exercise to add this functional programming structure to the symbolic programming language of Mathematica.", "suggested_query": "", "suggest_context": ""}
