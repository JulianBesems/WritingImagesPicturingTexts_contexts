      <li>&quot;Architectural education and practice is in a transitional mode of rethinking architectural theory, tools, applications, processes and states of representation and visualization. The latter bears the debate of intuitiveness to the designer’s idea and to that of a natural and true translation of the designer’s input data into a digital system and subsequently the systems’ output data; this can range from an undeﬁned sketch, via a crafted detail to input in form of a scripting language, descriptive modeling, voice recognition or the tracing of physical body movement to be translated into 2d-form or 3-dimensional space.&quot;[Marcos, Carlos L. *Graphic Imprints*.

<li>&quot;Think on the continued use of diagrams from Durand to Eisenman or the emergence of 2D computer drawing and the digital stratiﬁcation of information into layers and projects in strata such as Tschumi’s La Villette Park. Consider also the signiﬁcant change introduced by virtual modeling and the truly three-dimensional conception of architecture with blobs and folds—not a mere extruded space. Reflect on the development of scripting languages and parametric design, or on the topological notions applied to the concept of open form, algorithmic architecture and the natural counterpoint of digital manufacturing to enhance the materialization of this new digitally borne architecture: a brave new architecture addressing a new notion of materiality.&quot;[Marcos, Carlos L. *Graphic Imprints*.

<li>&quot;To that end, we need to differentiate between architecture as a physical support of information and its codiﬁcation or graphical representation.

Marcos (ed. ), Graphic Imprints, https://doi. org/10. 1007/978-3-319-93749-6_22 Information Design: Communication-Design-Record 265 draws three conceptual phases: ﬁrst, understanding the importance of communication in architecture; secondly, analyzing its implementation in architecture historically and in present time and, ﬁnally, understanding communication and architecture as an indivisible whole.&quot;[Marcos, Carlos L. *Graphic Imprints*.

<li>&quot;The same idea of mapping between source and target is used to describe analogical reasoning and inferences. For example, a reception area to receive people, doors and door frames, columns as vertical supports, parking spaces for cars, iron and stained glass design patterns, and typical design details appropriated for a given building system. [11] To further elaborate on what I said earlier aside from articulating a program, architects carry-over their experiences with materials, physics, art, culture, building codes, structures, plasticity, etc.&quot;[Fez-Barringten, Barie, and Edward Hart *Architecture: The Making of Metaphors*.

<li>&quot;New towns, malls, city centers, urban renewal, alternate use, and green building designs have already shifted design from limited building, site and project design to include theme, marketing, internet, lifestyle maintenance, health and well-being, recreation and entertainment and they already use an interdisciplinary vocabulary. The built environment is being synthesized and controlled by new professionals, design tools and evolving teams. Both architectural practice  Framing the Art vs. Architecture Argument  135 and use of its outcomes are incomplete because while it is a metaphor it is not known nor understood.&quot;[Fez-Barringten, Barie, and Edward Hart *Architecture: The Making of Metaphors*.

<li>&quot;Owner-occupied specialized works of architectural metaphors may encompasses everything from long periods of research; observations; analysis; conclusions; redesign; rethinking of existing or utility of new systems; setting our system feasibility; pricing and meeting budgets, palling and programming; diagraming and design of sub-systems and systems but when complete the metaphor is accessible, usable and compatible. The whole of the metaphor is designed in such a way as to clarify, orient and provide reification of all the design parameters into a “highly structured” work; a work which homogenizes all these diverse and disjointed systems and operations into a well working machine.&quot;[Fez-Barringten, Barie, and Edward Hart *Architecture: The Making of Metaphors*.

<li>&quot;LUDGER HOVESTADT is professor for Computer Aided Architectural Design at the Institute  for Information Technology in Architecture ITA at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology  (ETH) Zurich. He leads an interdisciplinary team of researchers who understand themselves as  technology scouts for architecture. His core interest is in the design of infrastructures, which he  defines from an application perspective according to the possibility spaces they are able to provide.  He has founded several spin-offs in the fields of digital fabrication, building information models,  and building automation. His recent publications include : Beyond the Grid.

<li>&quot;Rowe argued against object-form in building and for formed external urban spaces. The correct formal partnership of architecture and urban design could be achieved if buildings did not attempt to have form as objects but rather acted to form exterior spaces. To demonstrate this he compared a ‘Nolli’ plan of Parma and Le Corbusier’s unbuilt plan for the city of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. 22 In the latter there are buildings of generic and specific forms sited in a uniform field. Here space is merely displaced around the buildings.&quot;[Dorrian, Mark, and Frédéric Poussin (eds.) *Seeing from Above: The Aerial View in Visual Culture*. I.B.Tauris, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;I have argued in this chapter that self-organization can give systems the appearance of being intelligently designed while being in reality the result of dumb, natural mechanisms. It is a good question as to whether the fruits of undesigned self-organizing processes pass muster as being intelligently designed when viewed from the standpoint of Dembski&#x27;s claims about CSI. If they do, then the design inference will be invalid: for an enormous number of natural systems it will lead from true premises concerning contingency, complexity, and specification to false conclusions about intelligent design. An example may help. A natural phenomenon involving self-organization that can easily be reproduced in the laboratory concerns Bénard convection cells (figure 3-2). Consider a thin layer of water sandwiched between two horizontal glass plates. Suppose the system is at room temperature and in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. One region of water looks pretty much the same as any other.&quot;[Shanks, Niall, and foreword by Richard Dawkins *God, the Devil, and Darwin*. 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;We call this ontological contextual emergence, and we think it is often the best explanatory framework for complexity defined as the emergence of stable and self-maintaining patterns from more basic interactions. Before we get there, we need to say more about the various concepts of complexity and emergence. Sometimes it is particular properties of systems or dynamical processes that are considered complex: noncomputability such as algorithmic complexity, nonpredictability, nonderivability, inherent statistical complexity (e. g. , systems which are neither completely random nor completely ordered), information theoretic limits (e. g. , the no-cloning theorem in quantum information theory), stochasticity, multiple realizability, nonlinearity, self-organization, collective effects, feedback loops, hierarchies, interlevel or multiscale relations, phase changes, wholes or global properties constraining and modifying the behavior of their parts, robustness, plasticity and hysteresis would be examples discussed in the literature.&quot;[Gibb, Sophie, Robin Hendry, and Tom Lancaster *The Routledge Handbook of Emergence*. Hardcover. Routledge, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;We can now generalize. Synergetic systems, spatio-temporal dissipative structures, self-organizing systems, and the like work upon the same principles as form-generating processes. They constitute special cases of a more general category. They all utilize interaction between many-to-one mappings and hierarchical dynamics typified by class (b) situations. One can object to the above statement on the basis that our original model (a)-(c) was naive-corpuscular, whereas the typical models of pattern generation are not; most frequently, partial differential equations (PDE-s), Ising systems (i. e.&quot;[(Auth.), G.

<li>&quot;The exterior is perhaps a little too extravagant. The inside is a building with its very own character, the result of a combination of tradition, contemporary construction techniques and architectural ingenuity. ’60 These critiques brought the concepts of ‘typology,’ ‘contemporaneity’ and ‘design task,’ – common usage in the world of architectural education and applied in design and evaluation – into the world of Islamic architecture in the Netherlands. This meant that there was no room for the design process as an ongoing series of intensive negotiations between an architect and his influential commissioner.&quot;[Mekking, Aart J.J., and Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>

<li>&quot;The irreducibly complex systems Behe considers require numerous components specifically adapted to each other and each necessary for function. On any formal complexity-theoretic analysis, they are complex in the sense required by the complexity-specification criterion. Moreover, in virtue of their function, these systems embody patterns independent of the actual living systems. Hence these systems are also specified in the sense required by the complexity-specification criterion. (1999, 149) Because the complexity-specification criterion underlies the design inferences that intelligent design theorists wish to foist on us, and because the criterion singles out irreducibly complex biochemical systems as intelligently designed systems, a critical examination of Behe&#x27;s claims about irreducible complexity will have broad implications for the intelligent design movement as a whole, especially if it should turn out that irreducibly complex systems could plausibly have evolved without intelligent design, for this would show that not only is there something defective in the account intelligent design theorists offer of biological phenomena but also there is something end p. 164 profoundly deceptive about the methods they use to detect intelligent design.&quot;[Shanks, Niall, and foreword by Richard Dawkins *God, the Devil, and Darwin*. 2012.]</li>
