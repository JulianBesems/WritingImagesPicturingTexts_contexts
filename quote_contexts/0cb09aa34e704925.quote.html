      <li>&quot;Earthenware vessel with modeled net ornament (Toscanella) The more a form is aesthetically satisfying in itself, the less it will need the  aid of ornamental attributes for the completion and fulfillment of its expression. Ornaments, however, are often needed to correct a certain indeterminateness or even transgressions of the limits of pure form, or to bring into  sonorous accord those dissonances that are unavoidable, even inevitable, in  high artistic endeavors. Just as the luxuriant abundance of a youthful head  of hair becomes even more attractive when restrained and confined with a  golden net, a bulging vessel will seem even larger but also more secure when  ornamented with a braided pattern. &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;From this follows, first, that the envelope or cover should manifest itself as  a surface. Even that abstract sense of beauty unconcerned with use and function is violated by covers that do not have the property of being surfaces or  those in which this attribute is artificially or only apparently eliminated but  are, in keeping with their purpose, actually complete surfaces. Even more  absurd are disturbances to surface continuity when the material purpose of  the cover urgently requires that it form not simply a surface but a flat plane.  &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;It is the babble of painting. All art is erotic. The first ornament that came into being, the cross, had an erotic origin. The first work of art, the first artistic action of the first artist daubing on the wall, was in order to rid himself of his natural excesses. A horizontal line: the reclining woman. A vertical line: the man who penetrates her. The man who created it felt the same urge as Beethoven, he experienced the same joy that Beethoven felt when he created the Ninth Symphony.&quot;[Loos, Adolf *Ornament and Crime*. Penguin Books Ltd, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;Colour, then, can be in two places at once, like odour, and is not always the prisoner of an enclosing form. 36 The interaction of colours Even in western art, colour has been the servant of form. That cotours may be manipulated by adjacency to other hues has, though, a long history. This key point has remained unremarked in the social sciences, where colours have been treated as isolated hues without social, or even aesthetic, connectivity.&quot;[Young, Diane Jane Barbara *The Colours of Things: Memory, Materiality and an Anthropology of the Senses in North Western South Australia*. University College London, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;Given a page containing many groups of sensations and analogies, with each group composed of, say, three or four lines, then the first line of each group might be formed of pictorial sensations and analogies (printed in heavier typeface) and the same sort of chain would continue (always in heavier typeface) in the first line of each of the other groups. The chain of musical sensations and analogies (second line), though less important than visual sensations and analogies (first line), yet more important than the olfactory sensations and analogies (third line), might be printed in a typeface lighter than that of the first line, but heavier than that of the third.&quot;[Poggi, Christine, Lawrence S. Rainey, and Laura Wittman *Futurism : an anthology*. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;First, let us list the ornamentation used at the time, either in the form of paint or recovered paste. Everywhere you look are winged, rounded female forms (Victories, Muses, Graces, etc. ), busts of Minerva, garlands of flowers and fruits, palmette crowns, incense tripods, sacrificial alters, bucranes, foliage, thyruses, vases, inset portraits painted in monochrome or on porcelain, quivers, arrows, bows, caduceuses, scales, cornucopia, sphinx, birds, swans, crickets, chimaeras, mermaids, lightning under imperial eagles, all within bronze and gilded brass frames, applying white on light blue, light yellow, Sienna yellow, with imitation silk draperies in blues, pinks, yellows, etc, a renaissance of Raphael’s arabesques, reworked and corrected. . .

<li>&quot;What makes aluminum Christmas trees, for example, succeed as objects of nostalgia is that they can be “whimsical, sentimental, and even beautiful. ” Consider the ornamental glass balls inspired by the Sputnik satellite or even the A-bomb. The contrast of today’s generic chains of tiny lights with the bubbling “electric candles” of the 1950s creates a special appeal. And the decorative—yes, perhaps gaudy—beaded egg ornaments or reindeer candle holders have attracted collectors because they remind them of their childhoods.&quot;[Cross, Gary *Consumed Nostalgia: Memory in the Age of Fast Capitalism*. Columbia University Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Very striking with young children is the charm of some single and perhaps small feature, as, e. g. , a pair of shoes with buckles, stockings with clocks, jacket with bright buttons, a hat with a feather, a bit of fur here or ribbon there, a sash with buckle. So, too, the first pocket, the first trousers, suspenders, long pants or dress, first watch, parasol, muff, gloves, ring, necklace, standing collar, perfumery, new ways of wearing the hair, the first belt, breastpin, veil – all these stand out in memory in the most vivid way, and have played an important rôle in the education of self-consciousness.&quot;[Johnson, Kim K. P., Susan J. Torntore, and Joanne B. Eicher *Fashion Foundations: Early Writings on Fashion and Dress*. Berg Publishers, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;The first table was a flat stone propped on other stones placed upright. The first seat was a block of stone. How could art make any headway in the face of such uncomfortable, makeshift arrangements?Yet, however rudimentary it might be, the colourful, primitive nature of the first home could be considered a kind of style. Let us enter the cave of primitive man and examine it. It is coarse, artless, has a flavour of savagery and is full of disturbing shadows. Animal skins and silex axes hang on the walls.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*. Parkstone International, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;In fact, digitization was the first major revolution in graphic arts, particularly in how graphic design is produced and distributed if not conceived, since old man Guttenberg moved his earliest type slugs around in fifteenth-century Mainz. Even the shift from hot metal to cold type during the 1960s did not give individual graphic designers the same opportunity to directly control the setting and printing of content while dabbling with form. Faceless technology, paradoxically, made personal expressionism possible for everyone.&quot;[Heller, Steven *The Graphic Design Reader*. Allworth Press, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Each organ is essentially an extension of skin. Seeing, hearing, smelling and eating extend feeling and tactility. Touch brings immediacy to ugliness. Touch does not merely observe, hear or even smell beyond bounds but crosses the line and engages. Its connotations hover around ‘injury’, which philosopher Elaine Scarry defines as the true opposite of ‘beauty’. 144 Ugly touch can stain, infect, abuse or violate. Motivations may be culturally discouraged but, in other contexts, permitted and even encouraged by peers.&quot;[Henderson, Gretchen E. *Ugliness: A Cultural History*. Reaktion Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Few of his compositions lack a human figure as some minuscule indicator of scale; so even when conditions were evidently sunny and placid, the sense of an immanent Almighty is installed with due apprehension (Fig. 65). ART ON LAND The very first use of a photographic device, in 1826, seems to have been for a shot of scenery, producing what we might want to call a landscape. Again, we are reminded of art’s tenuous rapport with the environment – attempting to capture a view that is destined to change.&quot;[Spivey, Nigel *How Art Made the World: A Journey to the Origins of Human Creativity*. Basic Books, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Likewise, Steve Jobs was such a perfectionist that he held up shipping the original Macintosh until his team could make the circuit boards inside look beautiful, even though no one would ever see them. Both he and Leonardo knew that real artists care about the beauty even of the parts unseen. Eventually, Jobs embraced a countermaxim, “Real artists ship,” which means that sometimes you ought to deliver a product even when there are still improvements that could be made. That is a good rule for daily life.&quot;[Isaacson, Walter *Leonardo da Vinci*. Simon &amp; Schuster, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;I desaturate to make the drawing grayscale, adjust the levels to get some contrast in the line-work, and add some subtle shadows and highlights. This can then be printed (or emailed) and given to the art director as my reaction to the brief, and a first step in the troll design. ” Jonny’s first troll drawing based on his sketch pages. A second drawing merges elements from the first with other ideas. Jonny’s third troll is much more developed. The drawing is scanned into Photoshop where texture is added.&quot;[Crossley, Kevin *Character Design from the Ground Up*. ILEX, 2014.]</li>

<li>&quot;We do know from Ponziglione’s writings that the grand chief is a direct descendant of First Man, or Sun. With this information we can examine several sets of Braden figures for what might be the chiefly symbols. There are several good examples of First Man figures to examine. The first and the oldest is the figure of First Man and his son Morning Star, the “Symbolic Man” at Picture Cave (Figure 7. 6; see also Figure 6. 4B).&quot;[Deter-Wolf, Aaron *Drawing with great needles : ancient tattoo traditions of North America*.

<li>&quot;Brass brads added further embellishment. Skinner commented on seeing “similar examples, both as to form and decoration, even to the brass tacks, among the Kansa, Osage and Oto. ”8 Ioways decorated with quillwork, including plaiting; beadwork; and ribbons.&quot;[Broughton, Deanna Tidwell *Hide, Wood, and Willow: Cradles of the Great Plains Indians*.

<li>&quot;These pieces look dramatic and distinctive, but they are produced with relatively few tools, perhaps even on a production line. The makers have dozens of shortcuts to make carving faster. Decoration on the plate rim and details of the Mayan panels are done largely with a couple of gouges and a veiner; glyph patterns on the plate rim are repeated with only slight modification, but look quite different. None of the pieces has any laborious elements like surface texturing. None even has a rigid design; the two Mayan panels are halves of other pairs, but are near enough alike in &quot;feeling&quot; that they can be hung together.&quot;[Tangerman, E. J. *1001 designs for whittling and woodcarvings*. Dover Publications, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;Upon closer regard, it is clear that the style calls, as the calligraphy did, to the world of established visual practices. The careful rendering of leaves, of purple violets gracefully rising in space, and of yellow dandelions shooting upward are forms that are carefully shown in multiple perspectives and demonstrate skill in the art of painting. Three other botanical studies are included in the first and second volumes, each serving to demarcate a season. Halfway through the first volume summer is signaled by a magnificent double-page opening of iris and water plantain (figure 2. 4); the second volume features a study for autumn with Hibiscus mutabilis (fuyō) and Platycodon grandiflorus (kikyō), and for winter an arrangement of chrysanthemums.&quot;[Davis, Julie Nelson *Partners in Print: Artistic Collaboration and the Ukiyo-e Market*.

<li>&quot;In sum, the Disney site is about a “return” to the Edenic site of first delights, not in nature or in a preindustrial era of skilled work and slow-paced interactions with others but in a return to a commercialized childhood. And that memory is evoked not by grandparents or teachers or even childhood friends but by Mickey Mouse. This may seem paltry and even pathetic, but, as is true with other forms of commercial nostalgia, Disney’s lands and the Disneyana that it generates may be one of the few ways that we moderns have of getting in touch with our pasts.&quot;[Cross, Gary *Consumed Nostalgia: Memory in the Age of Fast Capitalism*. Columbia University Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Gurney [the pilot) said that next to the electric light the thing that seemed to interest Narmu most was the heap of tin cans and bottles. &quot;9 First Contact has a dizzying scene of a highlander recounting how as a kid he fearfully stole the lid of a tin can thrown away as garbage by the prospector, and worked it into a flashy ornament for his head. But unfortunately First Contact is too preoccupied to film those heaps of tin cans and bottles, for even though garbage is the outstanding sign of Western civilization-as Narmu perceived-it is not the side-effect of mechanical production that is congenial to the staging of First Contact, but rather the after&#x27;imaging of its mimetic machination.&quot;[Taussig, Michael *Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses*.

<li>&quot;When, after a spell of dull weather, the sun unexpectedly shines out warm and brilliant, who has not felt in that first glad instant that all nature shared his conscious gladness?Or, in the first hours of great bereavement, who has not experienced a feeling of wonder and even resentment at the sight of blue smiling skies and a sun-flushed earth?[…] It is doubtless true that we are animistic to this extent only at rare moments, and in exceptional circumstances, and during certain aspects of nature that recur only at long intervals.&quot;[Liedke, Heidi *The Experience of Idling in Victorian Travel Texts, 1850–1901*.

<li>&quot;Dog Save the Queen was the first print I produced, which sold very well and gave me confidence in my own work. Banksy also included me in the early ‘Santa’s Ghetto’ Christmas group shows, where many of my first paintings were sold, and in return I asked him to be in just about every show at the Outside Institute, even offering him a solo show, which he considered, I hasten to add, even if only for a second. Being part of that early POW collective and the first of the Santa’s Ghettos was a buzzing time, it felt like being a member of a killer band or crew, and our combined reputations carried serious clout.&quot;[D*Face, Shepard Fairey *The art of D*Face : one man &amp; his dog*.

<li>&quot;My rationale was inspired by the idea that the uniform could in essence be taken apart, with sections easily replaced or exchanged, including the incorporation of different shoulder pads or even more substantial armor. With regards to the helmet, I changed the design a little bit in these full body sketches, even reverting back to a shape more redolent of the very first design from 1977, but the thumbnails were too small to really show much detail at this stage.&quot;[Crossley, Kevin *Character Design from the Ground Up*.
