      <li>&quot;A picture is a fact. (2. 141, ibid) A picture is a model of reality. (2. 12, ibid) The elements of the picture are assumed to directly indicate the objects they represent. In a picture the elements of the picture are the representatives of objects.

<li>&quot;The picture of a man which is a part of this great picture has in its turn such parts as pictures of an arm, pictures of a leg and a picture of a head. The picture of a head in its turn has such parts as pictures of an eye. A picture could then be made by reproducing some of the parts of the original with icons. Figure 2 (in which use has been made of an iconic man and an iconic horse) might be a part of that picture: What is seen is a man on a horse.&quot;[Barker, Philip *Iconic Communication*. 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;The trade-oﬀ between caption and picture generates the joke. In contrast, the second example above comprises a co-presence of a caption, which tells the joke in its entirety, and a picture that illustrates that text (Fig. 4. 2). This cartoon would not pass Harvey’s “litmus of good comics art” that seeks to “ascertain to what extent the sense of the words depends on the pictures and vice versa” (1996: 4). The text makes sense on its own, sufﬁciently implying the framing situation that the picture makes explicit.&quot;[Miodrag, Hannah *Comics and Language: Reimagining Critical Discourse on the Form*. University Press of Mississippi, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Picture, used colloquially, is also nonspecific: a picture book might be a book of drawings or photographs, and in common speech a painting, drawing, or print is often called, simply, a picture. Equally important for my purposes, picture, in its verb form, can refer to a mental process as well as the production of an aesthetic object. The following essay takes its point of departure from the catalogue text for Pictures; but it focuses on different issues and addresses an aesthetic phenomenon implicitly extending to many more artists than the original exhibition included.&quot;[Krauss, editors Rosalind, and Annette Michelson *October journal No.8 Spring (1979)*. The MIT Press, 1979.]</li>
<li>&quot;A team is interviewed, and a picture is drawn that distils many aspects of the organisation&#x27;s current reality that are not usually discussed openly. It is then used to engage them in conversation. Usually it allows discussion on difficult subjects, as the picture, often containing humorous details, becomes a focus of attention creating a safe space to voice concerns and ask burning questions. Another application is as a bridge between team development and internal communication. From initial interviews with a team leader, a ‘Big Picture’ emerges that is used personally by him to communicate his vision/strategy/values to his teams, engaging them in a rich and insightful discussion.&quot;[Davies, Jo, and Leo Duff *Drawing, the process*.

Picture-like graphs, multidimensional images, and Frankenstein pictures are examples of things that aren’t really pictures or ﬁlms in the conventional senses of those words. The Wolf-Rayet star, velocity graphs, and speech sonograms are picture mimics: They work, in part, because they mimic pictures. 4 The Thicket of Representation “The thicket of representation” is a phrase coined by the biologist and philosopher William Wimsatt to describe the problem of making pictures of genes. 12 There are a half-dozen different conventions for making pictures of complex organic molecules, and no one of them is adequate by itself.&quot;[Veigl, Thomas, and Oliver Grau *Imagery in the 21st century*.

<li>&quot;“The inclination to present a picture as an explicit or implicit metonym is almost overwhelming, for journalists, scholars, and politicians. Yet, in truth, no picture ever says it all” (17). The media seemed to employ the “salute” photo in 1999 to contextualize a tragic event that would have been unremarkable except for the enduring fame of the subjects. The visual references to a 36-year-old photograph provided justification for extensive news coverage by linking the contemporary with historical significance.&quot;[Hill, Charles A., and Marguerite Helmers *Defining Visual Rhetorics*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;This means that this case study will be more than ordinarily theory-laden. 3. 1 Pictures and other iconic signs The picture is certainly a sign in the sense defined by Husserl and Piaget, as I have shown elsewhere (Sonesson 1989a; 2010b), that is, the expression of the picture, which is directly given but not thematic, is doubly differentiated from its content, which, while given in an indirect manner, is the thematic part.&quot;[Machin, David *Visual Communication*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;LC: The picture has the advantage of being immediately perceivable; we see it instantly. However, this is not valid for every picture we encounter. Sometimes, we need to have some knowledge on the argument featured by the picture to be able to understand it. Do you think that it is possible to explain a picture through other pictures?That is, by placing next to it pictures that explain it, by making it explicit in particular aspects, or by graphically adjusting and retouching original images.&quot;[Cocchiarella, Luigi *The Visual Language of Technique: Volume 2 - Heritage and Expectations in Research*. Cham u.a: Springer International Publishing, Cham, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;In a way, the picture illustrates Quinn’s feelings, but it is the divergence of text and picture that really illustrates—or rather performs—Quinn’s repression of his emotions, dramatizing the failure of human connection that sees him retreat when those feelings threaten to resurface. This conjunction of text and picture is anything but “seamless” or “uniﬁed,” yet is no 96 Comics as Language 4. 7 Paul Auster, Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli, City of Glass (London: Faber and Faber, 2004), p. 96. better characterized as a “contradiction” or “duel. ” Instead, text and picture threaten to peel away from each other, though this divergence carries its own very powerful message.&quot;[Miodrag, Hannah *Comics and Language: Reimagining Critical Discourse on the Form*. University Press of Mississippi, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;The audience and the train locomotive are depicted in a head to head confrontation on two sides of a gigantic picture frame that reassuringly separates and locates the moving picture within a well-delineated and laterally contained space opposite the spectators’ gaze. The picture frame is a recurring theme in depictions of early film exhibits. It is not certain how prevalent the use of a picture frame around the movie screen, often a stretched muslin sheet, may have been in the early exhibits.&quot;[Ameri, Amir H *The Architecture of the Illusive Distance*. New edition. Ashgate Pub Co, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Sonesson 1989a)2; but there is no need for these to be of a linguistic nature. Interestingly, even a student of press photographs like Lambert (1986) has voiced his doubts on the subject of this kind of linguistic determination. In the case of one particular picture, he shows that it is really the text that is redundant given the picture, rather than the other way round. Indeed, although the caption of this picture (Fig. 19. 1) informs us that one blond girl was elected Miss England, and that two dark-headed girls came out second and third at the election, the picture tells us otherwise; and even though the arrow points to the girl on the far right, we have no 2 Also cf.&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*.

<li>&quot;The referent can probably never be rendered 446 G. Sonesson in its entirety in a picture: we will have to make a choice among the possible noemata, the possible attributes, or both, and maybe also among the proper parts, and obviously (if we exclude X-ray pictures, and so on), we are limited to attributes and noemata having the attribute visibility (cf. I. 2. 4. ). (IVb) Protained continuities (cf. I. 2. 4. )from the expression plane of the picture to the expression plane (and thus the content) of other pictures, real or only possible ones.&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*.

<li>&quot;This means that it aims to determine what is true of every picture, of some more general categories of signs of which the picture signs are instances, such as iconic and visual signs, and of such special kinds of picture signs as paintings and photographs (construction types), posters and picture post cards (circulation types), art and advertisements (function types). This cannot be done by scrutinizing, however much in detail, a single picture. It is possible, of course, to examine closely a whole series of pictures, preferably such as are superficially very different, to draw conclusions about general properties, which can be further probed by adding ever more items to the study.&quot;[Machin, David *Visual Communication*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;• pictures - about eight good quality pictures including the accommodation base, a pub, a map of Cornwall and several picturesque landscapes at a decent size. • picture treatment - to frame the pictures and to avoid the angular effect of square pictures, we decided to use a magnifying glass image. This gives a circular frame for picture insets. The handle sticks out into text columns, creating interesting wraparounds and unifying across the page. • logo - the magnifying glass was so effective that we incorporated it into the logo.&quot;[(Hons), Simon Mitchell BA, and Cert.

<li>&quot;Nevertheless, its ‘transcendental’ application seems legitimate. If, for historical purposes, mediaeval representations have been distinguished from the later ‘picture’ by being called Bildzeichen (‘picture signs’, D. Frey), much that is said in the text of the ‘sign’ is true of such representations, but still the difference between them and the sign is obvious. Picture signs are not a kind of sign, but a kind of picture. 12 Cf pp. 64–73, Truth and Method.&quot;[Leach, Neil *Rethinking Architecture: A Reader in Cultural Theory*. Routledge, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;The difference between a picture and a sign has an ontological basis. The picture does not disappear behind its pointing function but, in its own being, shares in what it represents. This ontological sharing is part of the nature, not only of a picture, but of what we call a ‘symbol’. Neither symbol nor picture indicate anything that is not at the same time present in themselves. Hence the problem arises of differentiating between the mode of being of a picture and the mode of being of a symbol. 12 There is an obvious distinction between a symbol and a sign, in that the former is more like a picture.&quot;[Leach, Neil *Rethinking Architecture: A Reader in Cultural Theory*.

<li>&quot;Moreover, the whole “dispositif” (the apparatus responsible for the production of the image) makes its appearance in the photograph: the camera, metal sphere, and photographer (in Figure 4. 1 we can also see Brandt taking the picture) and the multiplied image referring to photographic reproduction. The photograph reveals that the sheltering effect of intimate objects can become deceptive.&quot;[Toth, Edit *Design and Visual Culture from the Bauhaus to Contemporary Art: Optical Deconstructions*.

<li>&quot;&#x27;The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Tulp&#x27; by Rembrandt (Figure 9. 15) shows a classic composition conceived to lead the eye around the picture. If we enter the picture from the upper left side, the trainee doctor who is looking directly at us initially engages the eye. He relates the audience to the picture by making eye contact with us.

<li>&quot;And yet, everywhere else, Magritte&#x27;s intarsia belies these crystallographic enchantments. Is The Human Condition to be understood as the very model of a perverse intarsia?The &quot;representing&quot; picture is certainly set into the &quot;represented&quot; picture like a piece of marquetry. But it is not a repetition in infinite regress; it is an extension, with no break in continuity. It gives us no glimpse of the picture, but conceals it from view; the &quot;picture&quot; hides the real, masking, not revealing, it.&quot;[Krauss, editors Rosalind, and Annette Michelson *October journal No.8 Spring (1979)*. The MIT Press, 1979.]</li>
<li>&quot;Instead of matching the photographic camera with the eye, as in Dziga Vertov’s famous “camera eye,” for instance, the artist juxtaposed it with the hand, highlighting its function as a hand tool. The picture insists that the camera is more than a “mechanical eye;” it helps to transform and question the world around us. Nevertheless, the camera that carries out the transformation in the picture is not one of the latest models.&quot;[Toth, Edit *Design and Visual Culture from the Bauhaus to Contemporary Art: Optical Deconstructions*.

<li>&quot;The sale of painted backgrounds for portrait photographs recalls the meaning of photography before Eastman Kodak created a market for amateur, everyday picture taking, starting in 1888. This catalog copy suggests the wide circulation of diﬀerent and uniquely personal portraits, all with identical, impersonal backgrounds. Documents like it can contribute precision to discussions of “the age of mechanical reproduction,” at least by undermining assumptions that the distinction between painting and photography is always one between uniqueness and mass production, or that painting and photography always form antithetical sources of meaning.&quot;[Gitelman, Lisa, and Geoffrey B. Pingree *New Media, 1740-1915*. The MIT Press, 2003.]</li>
