<li>&quot;Recently, I tore some pages out of an old book to use as a base for one of my projects. As usual, I was examining the text to remove anything that might not be appropriate for the theme of the project. And then I thought, why not cut out the words to create my own sentences?Like a horse out of the gates, I was on a creative journey, exploring another great use for old books.&quot;[Carroll, Shari *Layers: Inspired Collage for Paper Projects with Meaning*. 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;This is especially key within a large open-plan and multifunctional living space, where the grid is fundamental in defining different zones. Creating interesting vistas and using focal points to draw the eye from one area to another will enhance the sense of vitality and energy within a space. Lighting is another way to add drama.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>

<li>&quot;I tend to disagree. For one thing, there haven’t been many bucks cooperative enough to stand in one place long enough for me to dig out the range finder, get a reading, put the range finder away, come to full draw and shoot. Sure, one can and should use a range finder to mark trees; that can certainly help. But the uncooperative nature of bucks seems to dictate that they show up where we don’t expect.&quot;[Bartylla, Steve *Bowhunting Tactics That Deliver Trophies: A Guide to Finding and Taking Monster Whitetail Bucks*.

<li>&quot;Sure enough, there’s another ash pile indicating the use of Energy Weapons. Not only that, but Cass finds a map showing caravan routes to the west, and another possible ambush spot!Time for another reconnoiter. Track down Durable Dunn’s missing caravan with Cass. Plan 1B: Removing Jackson as a threat is only really an option if you’re going to be working for allies other than the NCR.&quot;[Games, Prima *Fallout New Vegas*. Prima Games, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Give consideration to the light source and avoid adding too many tiny, ambiguous shadows.&quot;[*How to Draw Manga. Volume 11. Maids &amp; Miko* 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;For example, one factor that led to widespread use of asbestos was its high resistance to fire. Thus, an optimized design process, with fire resistance as a major value, could easily serve as justification for use of the material. Add the other plus factors for use of the inert mineral material (water-resistive, nonrotting, etc. )and the result (as it actually developed) quickly produced quite popular, widespread use of the material.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;Since there’s so much more to energy efficient lighting than simply replacing bulbs, it’s best to make a lighting plan for each room before your retrofit begins. That way you’ll be able to maximize the use of the strategies described here for the greatest energy savings possible. — Electronics — One of my favorite writers, Wendell Berry, refuses to use a computer when writing his novels, essays, and poetry.&quot;[Wilson, Jeff *The Greened House Effect: Renovating Your Home with a Deep Energy Retrofit*. 2nd ed. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Another strategy in workspaces is to use small task lighting, like desk lamps, to light only the immediate area where work is being done instead of large, room-filling fixtures. A smaller bulb in a smaller fixture can be used up close for reading or countertop food prep, for example, instead of the scattershot approach of lighting an entire room from ceiling-mounted fixtures.&quot;[Wilson, Jeff *The Greened House Effect: Renovating Your Home with a Deep Energy Retrofit*. 2nd ed.

<li>&quot;This change in objective would make possible a trade-off of additional space in the building and greater building bulk for more open space for public use at street level. As a result also, objectives 5 and 6 could be more readily met. To provide a large open area to serve as a plaza at street level for public use, consider a sheer tower with a major portion of it raised up above street level on stilts, substantial columns (see Fig.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;Lighting is basically divided into two categories: general lighting to provide enough light in the room and task lighting providing light for the workplace. The use of task lighting is not common in office lighting, since the general lighting installed according to technical norms is unfortunately thought to be sufficient for human psychological and physiological demands.&quot;[Rostron, Jack *Sick Building Syndrome: Concepts, Issues and Practice*. Pap/Dskt. Spon Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;Use of any of the rooms in these halls is available only by arrangement with Janiff, and most Pathfinders never get to see all of the rooms—some reputedly haven’t been opened in years. He signs them out for short private meetings fairly often, but experienced venture-captains can sometimes rent one for a number of days to use as a base of operations in Absalom for an entire Pathfinder team.&quot;[Stephens, Owen K.C. *Pathfinder Chronicles: Guide to Absalom*.

<li>&quot;When I start a new project I gather together all the materials, colours and finishes I want to use before I decide where to use them – assigning them to curtains, furnishings, accessories or even flooring comes later. Mixing up textures within a scheme is a true hallmark of my style of design, creating drama in the unexpected pairings and harmony in the yin-yang dynamic as they intensify and balance out each other’s qualities.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*.

<li>&quot;Both are absolute musts for appropriate hygiene and comfort, even if they are not mandated by local codes. (A window can serve the ventilation function, but you’ll still need to install lighting for nighttime use. )When it comes to toilet enclosures, more room is always better. If you can dedicate extra space to the enclosure, you’ll not only make the space more comfortable, you’ll be able to add nice finishing touches such as a magazine rack or shelves for candles.&quot;[Press, Editors of Cool Springs *Black &amp; Decker Complete Guide to Bathrooms 5th Edition : Dazzling Upgrades &amp; Hardworking Improvements You Can Do Yourself*. 5th ed.

<li>&quot;In minimalistic spaces a detail, for example, furniture fixture, can integrate the interior design (e. g. Pure project). It is vital to create designs which are decoratively compact, functional, proportional and affect senses. Surface texture, ability to make use of natural light or creating the atmosphere with artificial light and expressing that texture affects our senses more and is set into nature.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*.

<li>&quot;I use this second plane to rough out a wide chamfer or bevel, or to shape a bullnose profile for a cabinet molding. The plane offers good control despite making aggressive cuts. I also use my second block plane, set for a light cut, to remove freshly dried glue from a panel, a far safer bet than risking tearout by scraping it off.&quot;[(Ed.), Christiana A. *Hand tool skills*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Throughout Palmer&#x27;s storied career, one of his trademarks was to go for broke with his drive and let the chips fall where they mayfrequently producing drives of incredible distance and accuracy.

By combining the effective use of fairway woods with the driver, you can create more opportunities for birdies and eagles on par 5s and long par 4s.&quot;[McDonald, Daniel, and Richard A.
