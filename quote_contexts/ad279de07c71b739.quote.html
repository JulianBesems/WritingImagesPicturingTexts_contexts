    <pre>Specifically, the work proposes an architectonic reading of the multimodal gap: the inherent misalignment between image and text that remains ingrained in machine learning embeddings. Rather than treating this gap as a technical flaw to be overcome, it is reframed as a conceptual opportunity. Drawing from Simondon’s notion of transduction, Foucault’s analysis of Magritte’s pipe, and the epistemic logic of architectural modalities, the multimodal gap is approached as a productive obstacle for speculation.</pre>

      <li>&quot;My speculation on the relation between architecture and photography is only a step in the direction of a more comprehensive critique of current architectural discourse; its theorization has yet to be taken up in a more comprehensive fashion. If, as Howard Caygill notes, in the most sustained treatment of Benjamin’s speculation on architecture to date, “all experience for Benjamin is technological, since the term technology designates the artificial organization of perception,”61 and if architecture for Benjamin is a “concrete a priori,” or “canonical art form,” and therefore the most effective means to technologically organize experience, then it warrants and indeed requires a media theory.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork &lt;i&gt;Walter Benjamin and architecture&lt;/i&gt;.

<li>&quot;As apparition of a grammar, such a language-image [immagine-linguaggio] implies a peculiar spectrality that affects the visible-invisible relation and structures the modalities of its fruition. From this point of view, the digital image—which can be multisensory—is not simply image-of; it is not only a mimesis of that of which it is image,2 identifiable or not, and is therefore not essentially simulacrum. 3 Nor, in any case, is it an icon4 or original image. On the contrary, it is a genetic-relational form that belongs to a multiple system of translation.&quot;[Roberto Diodato, Silvia Benso, Justin L. Harmon, John Protevi &lt;i&gt;Aesthetics of the Virtual&lt;/i&gt;. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Configuration becomes the inscription of an enduring object. He also transposes the notions of concordance and discordance, so central to his analysis of narrative, to architectural use of “irregular regularities. ”15 The architect has the same intention of discordant coherence that the narrator does in composing a story. Similarly, like a fictional work, an architectural work is a “polyphonic message. ” The phenomenon of inter-textuality applies to space also, namely the “reservoir of edifices” that provide the context for new buildings.&quot;[(eds.), Bruce B.

<li>&quot;Fundamental to this distanciation is architecture’s internalization of technique through recollection of the tectonic. What this entails is that a discussion of ‘image’, as one consequence of the introduction of mediatic technologies into architectural discipline, although it has proliferated diverse and innovative approaches to design, nevertheless dismisses the culture of building, thus putting limitations on the scope of criticism. To speak of the tectonic relationship between column and wall, for example, does not mean to dismiss the perceptual realm offered by the mediatic technologies.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork &lt;i&gt;Walter Benjamin and architecture&lt;/i&gt;. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;By the same token, however, we should guard against reading Benjamin too optimistically as assuming that the anaesthetization and alienation wreaked by technology on the human sensorium could be overcome. 13 Hansen’s last comment is instructive in guarding against the often over-optimistic, and even euphoric, reading of the role of new technology in architecture. It contains an important critical lesson that has yet to be investigated and integrated into the contemporary architectural discourse. Let me close this prologue by setting the terms under which the actuality of Benjamin can be claimed, including the legacy of his “media theory” and its possible implications for architecture as a form of “media. ” I shall return to this point in my afterword.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork &lt;i&gt;Walter Benjamin and architecture&lt;/i&gt;. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is also necessary that the system be completely differentiated both syntactically and semantically. Hence the definiteness and repeatability that digital devices can provide. Now, a digital image that is not properly modifiable in an interaction, not exactly interactive, might exemplify a semantic interpretation of a symbolic scheme. We would have then the opportunity to clarify beyond any process of resemblance the difference between an analog and a digital image, even when, paradoxically, the digital image “represents” the analog picture, or possesses the same “content. ” The digital image would then be a representation that is not a mere depiction but a description, as opposed to the painting, which is not a notational symbolic scheme, but rather one that is syntactically dense inasmuch as it fails to permit a finite scansion of the scale of values that belong to it.&quot;[Roberto Diodato, Silvia Benso, Justin L.

<li>&quot;&#x27;Combined analysis&#x27;, taking as its object both the morphology and the semantics of the image, has far greater range. A formalist description of the rhetoric of vraisemblance might begin with the proposition that lifelikeness or &#x27;high mimesis&#x27; results from a supposed exteriority of the signified to the signifier. 22 Reading a realist novel, we quickly lose the sense that we still possess when reading, for example, poetry, of the work of signification as a process occurring within the text; signification seems to enter the text from an &#x27;outside&#x27;, an outer reality which the text passively mirrors.&quot;[(auth.), Norman Bryson &lt;i&gt;Vision and Painting: The Logic of the Gaze&lt;/i&gt;. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 1983.]</li>
<li>&quot;Even a painting, like any analogic or digital image, is an image-thing [cosa-immagine] in a more or less mimetic sense. We can, for example, reflect on the ontological value of a painting-image [immagine-dipinto], understood in simple and traditional terms as a representational-mimetic form, and then work by means of difference. Gadamer, as we know, articulates an ontological model for this: In our analysis of the concept of the picture we are concerned with two questions only.&quot;[Roberto Diodato, Silvia Benso, Justin L. Harmon, John Protevi &lt;i&gt;Aesthetics of the Virtual&lt;/i&gt;. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2012.]</li>
