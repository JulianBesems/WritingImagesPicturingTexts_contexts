But there is something where the technology becomes ornament, in the sense that it conveys grandure, or hosts spectacle. First through structure becoming decorative with Rogers and Piano, Gehry, and so on, but now I think we're past that as well. Instead the absence of structure is the decorative more, see the large span of Ishigami's table, or Nishizawa's Naoshima museum, which very silently is the largest shell structure: decoration through absence. The purity of the surface without anything else. So here the surface has internalised the ornamentation beyond the visibly identifiable, but in it's own content.", "suggested_query": "The gleaming skyscrapers of a distant metropolis, their reflective surfaces mirroring the vibrant city life below, are a testament to this concept. The intricate networks of pipes, wires, and ducts that crisscross beneath our feet, though often hidden from view, are a more humble yet no less impressive manifestation of this idea. In both cases, technology becomes an integral part of the urban landscape, shaping our experience of the city and its inhabitants.", "suggest_context": "Fascinatingly, in the built environment, I wouldn't say we should expect or if you'd ask me hope for a return of obvious decorative ornament per-se.
