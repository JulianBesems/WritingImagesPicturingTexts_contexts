Any man that takes, or has already taken, possession of someone else’s wall,57 and a year goes by, and there are no claims against it, and then the owner of the wall says and swears that he did not know or see the other man take possession of his wall, and the Mayor orders that he relinquish the wall, and in the event two years went by, or longer, the owner must never lose his property, as long as nobody demonstrates that the owner of the wall was not in the city.[(auth.), Besim S.

01. "PAGE 20 WOVEN WALL The ur-wall is not, according to  19th century architectural theorist  Gottfried Semper, a mud or stone  line of enormous and reassuring  heft, but an artful, woven partition.  Hanging loosely, perhaps flapping,  the woven screen generates-   and, crucially, symbolizes -   the division and organization of  activities within the primitive dwelling. The woven "wall" is an enabler  of civilization; the thick structural  wall merely a defender of it. "[INPUT: wall.pdf]

04. "At Viracochapampa the regularity with which galleries had horizontal rows of corbels suggests that here the purpose may have been predomi- nantly utilitarian. In one or two examples, such as the wall at If, their appearance on what seems to be an external wall is due to the fact that the companion wall of a former gallery has been obliterated by plowing and cultivation."[McCown, Theodore D. *Pre-Incaic Huamachuco: Survey and excavations in the region of Huamachuco and Cajabamba*. Berkeley, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1945.]

05. "The actual windows in the inner skin are not aligned with the five empty window openings in the outer wall. The difference 6 between the vertical rhythms of both walls emphasizes the phase shift 7 between both skins, allowing reading the outer wall as being the mask, the 8 inner wall as being the face behind it. 9 Skin and mask belong to different sets of signiﬁers but are suscep- 10 tible to a similar semiotic effect."[Baydar, Gilsum *Negotiating Domesticity  Spatial productions of gender in modern architecture*. 2005.]

06. "Drying winds or solar heat will encourage evaporation of the moisture within the wall from its external surface, thus drying the wall out. If the wall is too thin then the rain penetrating through it may reach the internal surface before the weather change encouraging evaporation has had enough time to take effect. In the past, solid walls relied on this technique."[Charlett, Andrew J., and Maybery-Thomas Craig *Fundamental Building Technology*. Spon Press, 2007.]

08. "Hanging wall and foot wall are terminology from early mining days. 3. 4. 3. 2 Reverse Faults A reverse fault is the opposite of the normal fault, as shown in Fig. 3-9. The apparent motion of the hanging wall is up compared to the foot wall. Geotechnical Primer 87 Foot Wall Hanging Wall Figure 3-8. In a normal fault, the apparent motion of the hanging wall is down with respect to the foot wall."[Gatscher, Jeffrey A., AIA Gary L. McGavin, and Philip J. Caldwell *Earthquake Protection of Building Equipment and Their Systems: Bridging the Implementation Gap*. American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), 2012.]

09. "In both areas it is possible that the leveling was antecedent to, and part of, the wall construction because in other sections of the defense wall the same arrangement is not conspicuous. Reference to ﬁgure 6, d, shows a series of many small rectangular and square houses forming what appears to have been a separate colony within the bend of the defense wall at that point."[McCown, Theodore D. *Pre-Incaic Huamachuco: Survey and excavations in the region of Huamachuco and Cajabamba*.

11. "The separation of the outer and inner leaf in a cavity wall does help to provide some discontinuity within the structure of the wall itself, but complete discontinuity between the two leaves of the wall is not possible since the wall ties that link the two leaves together are also likely to be able to provide paths for structure borne sound transmission across the cavity."[Charlett, Andrew J., and Maybery-Thomas Craig *Fundamental Building Technology*.

15. "38 The Complete Survival Shelters Handbook Finish the Wall 1. Fill the wall with debris. Once your weave is complete, gather as much debris as you can find, and fill the wall up, tightly packing all available space with debris. I find that using smaller armfuls, and using a stick to “stir” the leaves down after placing them in the wall works best to achieve a tightly packed mass of debris without disturbing the weaving too much."[Akkermans, Anthonio *The complete survival shelters handbook : a step-by -step guide to building life-saving structures for every climate and wilderness situation*.

18. "Obviously the intention was to create the effect of vistas through the wall, such as later appeared in wall paintings of the Second Pompeian Style. The entrance to the kline chamber reflects the same concept. In this case, the wall is decorated with a small tetrastyle Ionic temple facade supporting a low pediment; this scheme recalls the facades of Macedonian tombs."[Fedak, Janos *Monumental Tombs of the Hellenistic Age: A Study of Selected Tombs from the Pre-Classical to the Early Imperial Era*.

19. "Kosny and Desjarlais (1994) define a clear wall area as the part of the wall system free of thermal anomalies such as corners, window and door openings or joints with other structural elements. In the discussed case, because of the wood framing, the RSI 3. 5 (R20) wall becomes an RSI 3. 1 (R 17. 6) wall. Historically, the shift from extensive measurements of heat transmission through the structures (Pratt, 1969) to computer calculations (Kosny, 1995) was slow."[Bomberg, Mark, and Joseph W. Lstiburek *Spray polyurethane foam in external envelopes of buildings*. CRC Press, 1998.]

20. "Most likely, this was the edge of a ravelin built to protect the south curtain wall of the fort from possible attack from downriver. Projecting the angle of this wall, the inner wall of the ravelin may have come as close as 10 feet (3. 1 m) from the south curtain wall. The cobble stone facing of the moat and this stone wall probably represent efforts to rebuild the fort in 1648 with stone."[Klingelhofer, Eric C *First forts : essays on the archaeology of proto-colonial fortifications*. Leiden ; Boston: Brill, 2010.]

21. "If the wall acts as a vertical cantilever, the tensile forces in the wall, and therefore the main vertical bars, are on the uphill side, where they must be well anchored into the footing (Figure 6. 27). Occasionally, a retaining wall is designed to span as a horizontal beam between its two ends. In this case, the tension in the wall is on the downhill side, and horizontal bars in this location resist the force of the retained soil."[Allen, Edward, and Rob Thallon *Fundamentals of Residential Construction*. 3rd ed. Hoboken, N.J: John Wiley and Sons, 2011.]

22. "Stratigraphically, it overlies both the eastern boundary wall of the large enclosure and the north wall of both enclosures. This stratigraphy is the goal of next season’s field work. Work in the recent past seasons has concentrated partly on the northern wall of the large enclosure and on the western wall of the same complex. Cutting across the site from north to south is a dug well with its exit channels flowing northwards and southwards Near the point where the northern outflow interrupts the enclosure wall, a test square was excavated and has provided a mystery."[Bagnall, Roger S., Paola Davoli, and Colin A. Hope *The Oasis Papers 6: Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference of the Dakhleh Oasis Project*. Oxbow Books, 2013.]

23. "A non‐load‐bearing wall is one that does not support ceiling or floor weight from above or any other weight factors distributed to this wall. Wall insulation is shown as a means to decrease noise transmission between the various tenants. Figure 14. 13 Tenant separation wall. The construction techniques for a wall assembly used within a specific suite may vary."[Wakita, Osamu A., Richard M. Linde, and Nagy R.

25. "The wall is undoubtedly the north wall of the castrum. It borders the north side of the old well and is parallel to the wall alignment near the old mosque. The position and lines of the two walls as well as traces of matching wall identified just east of the old well has provided us with an idea of the general size of the castrum. The structure had an internal area of approximately 3,364 sq m (circa 58 x 58 m)."[Bagnall, Roger S., Paola Davoli, and Colin A.
