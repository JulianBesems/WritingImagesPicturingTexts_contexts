      <li>&quot;*The two options, one emphasizing the corporeal properties of things made, the other concentrating on the disembodied properties in the drawing, are diametrically opposed: in the one corner, involvement, substantiality, tangibility, presence, immediacy, direct action; in the other, disengagement, obliqueness, abstraction, mediation and action at a distance.* — **Interesting as an argument for the approach that has been taken to the role of the computational in representing architecture. This has been primarily been through that of the first &quot;popular&#x27; option. Thus the challenges of the second have been neglected in this form/technics of communication.** [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=6&amp;annotation=Q6KQN5ZC)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*This overview provides enough information to let us investigate the extent to which computer graphics and its modelling schemata have influenced architectural modelling. In this regard, the crucial notion to consider is the notion of space. It was demonstrated that the internal representation of the modelling schemata used in computer-aided design relies not only on Cartesian361 but also topological notions of spatiality. 362 However, the way this internal representation is employed in the modelling process is surprisingly limited.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=75&amp;annotation=9Z9WXXCU)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The intention of this work is to apply the conceptual framework of natural communication in the domain of architecture. By means of communication bridges between different domains, the resolution of a problem unsolvable within architecture will be presented as the resolution of a matching problem in its conjugate symbolic domain. The solution can then be decoded back to architecture.* — **Relevant to the discussion on domains** [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=146&amp;annotation=BYSSV5P3)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Mined from advanced mathematics, the complexities and contradictions of this architecture multiply, leading to the story’s surreal conclusion (to which we shall return). Fantastic as it may seem, this fiction was paralleled to a remarkable degree by ever-deeper architectural fascination with modern mathematics in mid-twentieth-century design culture. In fact, exactly the methods that Quintus Teal mentions—such as modular structures and homomorphology—were taken up by architects who saw in advanced mathematics a portal to dizzying new spaces and practices, unerringly precise and resolutely contemporary. This book probes the facts of form and the frontiers of creative rationality. It confronts these conjoined issues through a close reading of mathematics as it was drawn, encoded, imagined, and interpreted by architects in the mid-twentieth century, on the eve of digitization. The Swiss architect, artist, and educator Max Bill neatly distilled the general mathematical optimism in his 1949 essay “The Mathematical Approach in Contemporary Art” (Die mathematische Denkweise in der Kunst unserer Zeit) when he announced, “I am convinced it is possible to evolve a new form of art in which the artist’s work could be founded to quite a substantial degree on a mathematical line of approach to its content. ”2* — **Good point, however now the realm of mathematics we talk about here is one of form finding applications, thus leading to combinatoric complexity. The mathematics in itself is not one of complexity, nor one of euclidean geometry. In this fashion we should not seek to find a mathematical model that relies on functions producing architecture. Instead seeking for associations between the domains of architectural communication and understanding is one that mathematical thought is suited at to be able to make talks between domains. Putting them in proportion instead of geometry. In a fitting way the current emergence of ML models that do not rest on mathematical functions for their projections facilitate a talk that is not of complexity or combinatorics. However the mathematical thought now comes in to be able to speak about the nature of these projections on a level of group theory, topology and category theory. In these mathematical fields the study does not revolve around calculations of singular outcomes, inevitably leading to complexity, instead it is about communications between sets through operations, lifting them out of their singular interchangeable state of objects, but to friends, families and enemies.** [AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RFAYGAN3?page=11&amp;annotation=JYWPTG8F)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*ere, I would like to mention a potential risk that comes unseen with the cheerful optimism of programmable contemporary design tools. In many such tools, the ability to program often takes place within an already existing model, whose ontology is hidden from the user for the sake of simplicity. This can empower a designer to quickly create results, but it also stops her from comprehending the bigger picture. In* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=104&amp;annotation=GQ435M2G)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The second possibility flows directly from this. If one way of altering the definition of architecture is to insist on the architect&#x27;s direct involvement, either calling the drawing &#x27;art&#x27; or pushing it aside in favour of unmediated construction, the other would be to use the transmissive, commutative properties of the drawing to better effect. This latter option - which I call the unpopular option - I wish to discuss in this article.* [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=6&amp;annotation=A5ILQVRK)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*As long as the work of a designer is performed in a manual fashion, which is still a dominant mode of design365, we cannot regard the tools he/she uses as computational, mathematical, or intelligent, regardless of their sophisticated underlying infrastructure. In terms of modelling, Sutherland’s Sketchpad (* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=76&amp;annotation=BKEFK5TC)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*A physical model is an another prominent type of architectural encoding. Smith describes it as the mechanism that helps architects develop an understandable scale with which to measure an unknown thing, such as a future building. 881* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=239&amp;annotation=74VVX6TR)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*architectural competitions and the real estate market are the spaces of speculation par excellence* — **Architectural design is inherently a speculative nature, the linear (both in addition of specificity) and cartesian relation of the 3D cad model seek to mitigate this nature, possibly to the detriment of the quality.

Japanese communication of design remains much more on a non specified plane, leading to architectural outcome that dare to take space within a contingency of speculation between the communication model and the manifestation.** [Villa Riccardo Matteo - 2019 - Architecture as Currency.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D8HVT82H?page=64&amp;annotation=CTV99R82)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Where things become complicated, is that on a given line of reasoning - here on the thesis of progress - several themes of mathematical origin overlap. At the limit, this science projects its distributive totality at each distinguished point of philosophical meditation.* — **Different architectural communications to be used to the same end** [01b. en (gpt) _deuxiÃ¨me chapitre_ premiÃ¨re partie [Serres, Michael_Le systÃ¨me de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QZSBPEL6?page=7&amp;annotation=XMJCH4N8)&quot;</li>
