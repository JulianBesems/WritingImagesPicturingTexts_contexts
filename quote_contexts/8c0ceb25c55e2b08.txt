Selected: The world model is, therefore, undoubtedly “exhaustive” and “resolved” within itself, hence the character of Totalvorstellung. However, it can never be “exhausted” nor lead to a definitive “solu­ tion,” as this would confer the systematic character proper to the world image — Relevant for the digital twin argument and the question of what an image is, as an absolute in relation to text.

01. "*The world model is, therefore, undoubtedly “exhaustive” and “resolved” within itself, hence the character of Totalvorstellung. However, it can never be “exhausted” nor lead to a definitive “solu­ tion,” as this would confer the systematic character proper to the world image* — **Relevant for the digital twin argument and the question of what an image is, as an absolute in relation to text.** [Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7EH52CZI?page=43&annotation=MBIVBTDN)"

02. "*Perhaps the most important shift this entails is in learning to cope with a certain notion of indeterminateness and cyclicity that is immanent to materiality itself, and within which chance factors as an objective, formally determinative aspect.* [Buehlmann__Mathematics_and_Information_in_the_Philosophy_of_Michel_Serres.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QWPAXNP5?page=35&annotation=BXCZ93BG)"

03. "*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&annotation=WA8NIH6S)"

04. "*An Informational Instrument celebrates these contradictions without having an explicit a priori base unit. It opens a different perspective. What if the emphasis is not on measuring reality but on encoding and decoding it in many ways, by crafting different keys to access the world in many ways? What if it is about articulating faces and mixing libraries? It is a different game then. You are not looking for specific properties to measure, but are trying to develop a communication channel through which you can articulate profiles of different encodings. This is the search for the most general and abstract ingredients in a given situation. There is no base unit of a book. Yet, in a Plentiful Play books are profiling libraries from many perspectives simultaneously. A book becomes a constitutive part of a character of an alphabet that articulates its library—a symbolic void element* — **Interesting to relate to groups, rings, and bodies** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=308&annotation=4WBUS9PP)"

05. "*The context shapes the resources available for meaning making and how these are selected and designed.* — **Check article by xy? In coding** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=269&annotation=RVVZVLII)"

06. "*What interests us is the inversion from—putting it succinctly—the “mastership in creating objects” (5th c. ) to “objects presenting mastership” (3rd c. ). In the 5th c. , “mastership” is necessary and objects are contingent, whereas in the 3rd c. , “good objects” are necessary and mastership is contingent, which we would symbolize as: (C)N vs. (N)C.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt & Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=24&annotation=SME2ISPC)"

07. "*If language is always accessible as a formed substance (i. e. , text, speech, thoughts. . . ), then what can be said about the unformed substance? Hjelmslev noticed that whatever this substance might be, it would in any case be a factor which is common to all languages.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=174&annotation=P4YW7JF3)"

08. "*the only way of dealing with information is abstraction, and it can be adequately used only by those who are, in a mass of information, able to define their contexts as flexible, adjustable fields of possibilities with polyvalent, and ultimately undecidable, meaningfulness.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt & Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=20&annotation=PCDGV9M8)"

09. "*Such a canonical attitude implies the awareness that the sources will determine the argument as much as the argument will determine them.* — **Useful phase for my phd** [Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7EH52CZI?page=21&annotation=JAMB6IBR)"

10. "*In this sense, informational faces are beyond objective and subjective, practical and poetic. As Eco would say, we are lost in the infinity of lists, but we are ready for informational plays in the world of data. A different space is opening up. We are able to tell stories by articulating and playing with the generic* [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=329&annotation=MHG4I2XG)"
