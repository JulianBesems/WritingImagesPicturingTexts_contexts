Foucault emphasises that the split between linguistic and visual registers is not a contradiction, but a constitutive feature of representation itself. On the white space between pipe and text he writes, image and text fall each to its own side, of their own weight. No longer do they have a common ground nor a place where they can meet, where words are capable of taking shape and images of entering into lexical order.. This fragmentation of common ground is not merely a breakdown but an unveiling of the void between modalities, a crevasse through which new relations might be imagined rather than described. Foucault insists that the statement this is not a pipe is not a contradiction but a revelation of the rupture between designation and design. As he notes, designation and design do not overlap ... Hence the third function of the statement: This this ensemble constituted by a written pipe and a drawn text is not is incompatible with a pipe this mixed element springing at once from discourse and the image.
