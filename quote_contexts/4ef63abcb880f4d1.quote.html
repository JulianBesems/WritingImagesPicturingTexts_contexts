      <li>&quot;Le Corbusier decided to place different types of glass in these openings: clear glass, coloured glass, and glass painted with simple motifs, some of which bear inscriptions of praise to the Holy Virgin. The architect’s decision to use clear glass and to splash only a few precise places with touches of colour corresponds to his wish to keep a tight rein on the use of light – a primordial element in the definition of the interior volumes. The colours employed are the same as those for the door: blue, red, yellow, green and violet.&quot;[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;He adds: “intention: a human being, on the one hand, with a gestating idea, which he exteriorises for those who look, live and experience – in other words once again a human being, another human being and so on. Thus architecture needs a human language”. 11 For Le Corbusier it is indubitably light which links the terms of language expressed in an architectural work: “As you can imagine, I use light freely; light for me is the fundamental basis of architecture. I compose with light”. 12 Light sources are used sparingly but their positioning is of capital importance when defining the interior volumes.&quot;[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;7. 36). Such proposals, offering maximum transparency through the use of large sheets of glass and minimizing the apparent means of support, have been adopted almost as a style of architecture identified with the 1990s. Brookes Stacey Randall Fursdon’s use of curved toughened glass and cast stainless steel fittings at the Thames Water Tower, London (Anon, 1996), led the judges of the RIBA Awards 1995 to comment: ‘Such is the inspirational nature of the tower that the panel felt its qualities transcended the question – is this sculpture or architecture?’ (Fig.&quot;[Brookes, Alan J., and Maarten Meijs *Cladding of Buildings*. 4th ed. Abington [England]; New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The fascination which glass inspires in designers is explained by its aesthetics and functions. Its transparency, affording both light and vision yet imposing separation and even isolation worth appreciating. It can, do the very opposite as well. Glass can form building’s envelope as opaque as stone, reflecting images and allowing light to reach the interior, without compromising vision through to the exterior. Glass can also provide a delicate covering that softens a building’s mass, or indeed accentuate it, by simply reflecting both light and the surrounding environment.&quot;[Garg, N.K. *Guidelines for Use of Glass in Buildings*. New Age Publications (Academic), 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;But even under dullyovercast conditions the light has an incandescent quality, seemingly brighter than intuition would allow. Artificial light is not regarded as a merely functional night-time substitute for daylight and sunlight. From all viewpoints the interior is punctuated by hand-made, clear glass lamps, suspended from the vaults or spaced upon the walls. These are lit at most times, regardless of the quantity of natural light, and with their pin-point brightness, add a further dimension to the nature and meaning of the interior.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;20 In addition, Soane consistently used colour to modify the effect of light. This was achieved in two ways. First, he used coloured glass directly to modify the tonality of the light that entered a building, false or mysterious light. Second, he made precise judgements about the colours that he painted internal surfaces and, thereby, controlled the nature of reflected light. In developing these techniques Soane referred to sources Soane, Labrouste, Mackintosh – pioneers of environment 7 env_imag_fourk. qxd 5/7/07 9:26 am Page 8 such as the contemporary philosophy of Edmund Burke, the aesthetic theories of Goethe, Kant and Price and the scientific work of Thomas Young, Sir David Brewster and Moses Harris.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;This is one reason landscape architects seldom use glass even though it is sufficiently safe, strong and durable to survive the normal rigors of public exposure. For architecture, the search for transparency has dematerialized glass. Once this end was achieved, artists and designers have become intrigued by manipulating and distorting glass, giving it presence even as it satisﬁes the fundamental emotional need for light and the equally important duty to be energy efficient (see Figure 38). Glass joins the materials examined thus far—metals, brick and ceramics—which are the “ancient trinity of materials that were born of ﬂame” (Amato 1997: 30), but its varied afterlife and potential for contradictory tendencies are unique characteristics.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Premodern glass production processes left “reams” (small waves or folds) and “seeds” (small air bubbles) in glass that was not completely clear or uniformly thick, causing uneven reﬂections. Consequently, glass had material presence. Light refracted unevenly and chemical impurities left traces as color, but these qualities did not mitigate the great advantage of allowing light, and not air, to pass through walls. Today, technological advances produce glass that is perfectly clear, without blemish or undesired color, and unless it is dirty, there is no material presence.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Permanent decoration is often seen in marble (whose methodical extraction developed their unique and infinite colouration), stucco or various other polished materials; all these make provision for the taut architectural lines and provide a valuable setting for furniture. Mirrors, moulded or engraved glass and stained glass windows irradiate natural light and filter electric light.&quot;[Charles, Victoria, and Klaus H. Carl *Art Deco*. Parkstone International, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;The upper storeys need less window area than the lower ones, and if the atrium walls are light in colour the upper walls will reflect light toward the lower storeys. A further strategy is to use clerestory windows to allow light from the overhead rooflighting to penetrate the rooms, side windows to allow a view and, on lower storeys, light reflected from the atrium floor. Designers must make safe provision for cleaning the atrium glazing internally and externally. This may usefully be combined with access to the electric lighting equipment.&quot;[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*. Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;• Position, type and colour of coating • Colour of base glass Use of Glass in Buildings 50 Amount of light reflected depends on: • Amount of incident light • Type and position of coating While from the technical standpoint, performance requirements and costs should narrow down the available choices, the selection is often influenced by the visual appeal of glass in interiors or exteriors. The selection of glass for a particular application from aesthetic point of view is largely a matter of designers preferences &amp; owners choice.&quot;[Garg, N.K. *Guidelines for Use of Glass in Buildings*. New Age Publications (Academic), 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;To block out an undesirable view, use a stained glass panel the size of the window; to focus attention on the view, select a rectangular or curved stained glass frame around clear glass. Clear glass mixed at random with colored glass in a single panel gives a feeling of depth . A glass bird or foliage pattern complements house plants or enriches a garden view. If your window has many small panes, consider replacing only a pane or two for a colorful splash of light. For a room with a double-hung or horizontally sliding window, you can create an especially rich feeling by designing each sash with different colors.&quot;[*Windows &amp; skylights* Menlo Park, Calif: Lane Pub. Co, 1982.]</li>
<li>&quot;A simpler form has sometimes been adopted to aid the understanding of the terms involved. A full technical glossary is given in the CIBSE Code for interior lighting (27). Colour rendering is a general expression for the appearance of surface colours when illuminated by light from a given source compared, consciously or unconsciously, with their appearance under light from some reference source. Good colour rendering implies similarity of appearance to being under daylight. Artificial sky A chamber or room in which models of buildings are placed to test their daylighting characteristics.&quot;[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*. Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;For the new glazing of the roof lights, a combined sun-protecting and heat-reflecting glass with a colour rendering index of 95% was chosen. The skylights were ﬁtted with a light diffusing prism glass with a transmittance of 70%. To control incident daylight, a louvre system was installed in the attic. It is regulated according to the seasonal solar zenith angle. The artiﬁcial light installations in Gallery X were transferred into the attic.&quot;[Manfredi, Carlo *Addressing the Climate in Modern Age&#x27;s Construction History: Between Architecture and Building Services Engineering*.

<li>&quot;Scheerbart’s 1914 novel The Gray Cloth and Ten Percent White: A Ladies Novel, recently translated by John Stuart in 2001, is certainly not a straightforward propagandizing tool for Glass architecture. Newly married to Clara, the central character, a priggish Swiss architect and a former archaeologist, Edgar Krug, travels the world in an airship attempting to win commissions for vast structures entirely of coloured glass. His condition for marriage is that Clara only ever wears a particular shade of grey to not despoil the glass interiors.&quot;[Short, C.

<li>&quot;Architectural glass was the broad focus for this symposium. Papers and presentations were targeted to deliver information the user may find useful related to the quality, design, use, and performance of architectural glass. The symposium had a broad focus that incorporated a variety of glass-related topics. Emphasis on glass design was also a key feature to the symposium. The papers contained in this publication represent the commitment of the ASTM E-06. 51 subcommittee to providing timely and comprehensive information on glass used in buildings.&quot;[Valerie L.

<li>&quot;It surveys current work through a group of case studies, and in doing so will be of interest to anyone engaged in the building arts: architects, engineers, designers, developers, contractors, students, and others inspired by the use of glass in architecture, but especially those interested in actually utilizing this technology. This book is about sharing a passion and perhaps, in the process, creating broader interest in the use of SGF technology, whether by the architect interested in a highly glazed concept for a new airport facility, the developer of a new office tower contemplating a dramatic lobby space that merges interior and exterior public spaces, a glazing contractor contemplating a first-time bid on a project that includes a tension-based SGF, or a student wishing to explore a structural glass enclosure on a studio project.&quot;[Patterson, Mic *Structural Glass Facades and Enclosures : a Vocabulary of Transparency*.

<li>&quot;Uplighting and walls washed with light create visual interest and a gentle contrast to enhance the interplay of colour and texture. Individual workstation task lighting to suit the type of activity being carried out can add to the general lighting environment. Highly reﬂective surfaces, glare and over-brightness should be avoided to reduce visual fatigue and eye strain. Low-grade computer software producing poorly deﬁned images is another source of disturbing visual stress. Architectural interior features of colour and texture will modify the overall quality of light.&quot;[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]</li>

<li>&quot;The other parts of the light in the spectrum are absorbed or Jess readily transmitted. The intensity of the colour depends on the amount of colouring agent, e. g. cobalt oxide, present in the glass. 42 THE INFLUENCE OF GLASS THICKNESS ON LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE There are many different methods by which colours can be defined. Spectral transmittance curves give accurate definitions of coloured glasses.

<li>&quot;At a subtle level, the unsettling and disconcerting ‘discrepancy’ adds to the stress of sensory confusion. Working – or living – under tinted glass and artiﬁcial light inhibits the pineal gland’s ﬂow of serotonin, which reduces our sense of vitality and aliveness to the point where, after a time, we feel drowsy and fatigued. Dark tinted glass or mirrored glass have produced dramatic façades and are effective against solar heat gain, however glass manufacturers have now developed a virtually clear glass to ﬁlter out the radiant heat from the Sun.&quot;[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]</li>
