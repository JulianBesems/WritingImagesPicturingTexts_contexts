The stairs form part of valuable haptic  experiences. Among all the building  components, they reflect most accurately  the habits of its users. An examination of  their original texture and their consequent  changes may allow for conclusions to be  drawn, which can answer the question  raised above regarding the time when  lifestyles changed.

<li>&quot;Some people still protest that such a distinction should still be made – that the word ‘staircase’ should mean the enclosure and not the stair. However, this definition does not reflect either the OED or common usage. As the OED admits, the word staircase is now (and has been for some time) used to mean ‘a flight of stairs or sometimes a whole series of flights of stairs with their supporting framework, balusters etc. ’ This book will follow the OED definition and the general understanding, that a staircase means the whole, made up of stairs, balusters, handrails, etc.&quot;[Campbell, James W.

<li>&quot;Other dimensions apply to curved stairs 16 . Other factors relevant to stair safety include lighting, slip resistance, single steps (most codes prohibit flights of fewer than three steps), handrails, and inability to detect the edge of the tread due to lack of contrast. REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR EGRESS STAIRS The building regulations summarized below are from countries that are widely disbursed and culturally different, and should be representative of any range of methods used to treat egress.&quot;[Bukowski, Richard W. *Emergency Egress From Buildings*.

<li>&quot;For stairs, occupants first ascended and then descended stairs after a 5-min rest. No information was provided about the number of steps or stair dimensions, but the speed was measured along the slope of the stairs. Forty-two subjects were able to participate in the stair portion of the experiment. Of these, 8 did not have a disability, 4 needed assistance from another person, and 30 had a disability, but were able to use the stairs without the assistance from another person.&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A.

<li>&quot;The so-called 7/11 stair geometry commonly required in US codes meets the relation 2R+G=635. Templer 15 summarizes a number of research studies of stair geometry and safety. Many such studies were conducted by observing people moving up or down stairs in buildings. Observations in subway or train stations at rush hours provided data for higher population densities.&quot;[Bukowski, Richard W. *Emergency Egress From Buildings*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;1985; Shields et al. 2009) times were given on a per floor basis. However most of the authors instead calculated speed based on a measured distance within the stairs. When descending stairs in a high-rise building, travel distance in stairs needs to include both travel on landings and treads. The differences in the studies regarding travel distance stemmed from which components were included and, if included, how the travel distance was calculated.&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A.

<li>&quot;Stairs in Pathfinder Stairs are represented in Pathfinder through straight-run of steps. The model requires the input data about riser, tread and width (see Fig. 4. 21). In Pathfinder, the specified tread rise and run are the factors considered in the calculation, i. e. , the simulation is not dependent on the geometric slope of the stairs. Stairways denote areas where the maximum occupant speed is controlled by an alternate specific calculation.&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;The likelihood of the agents to wait in a queue is determined by their patience coefficient. The model permits to represent the interactions between horizontal and vertical components. Stairs in STEPS There are two different methods to simulate stairs in STEPS. A possible method is the use of the stair menu (see Fig. 4. 24). This menu permits to define the geometric characteristics of the stairs (e. g. , width, height, handrails, walking side, etc.&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*.

<li>&quot;H o w e ve r, once the tread is of sufficient  depth/ and in order to allow the stair  user to step pro- and regressively  without falling into a potentially  dangerous monotony, it is appropriate  to modify Baumler&#x27;s idea. A first variant is proposed by the  Centre for Stair Research. It maintains  all treads of one flight at the same  depth. This, combined with differential  riser heights, results in challenging the  stair user with changing lengths of  step, which activates their reactions.

<li>&quot;Cantilevered stairs have been described in the previous chapters. They provide an excellent example of the variety of ways that engineers become involved, whether the stairs are traditional in form and materials, or are modern feature stairs built in new materials.
