    <pre>For the purposes of this thesis, the value of these formal and pattern-based approaches lies in the way they extend what counts as computable architectural content. Alexander’s patterns encode social and spatial situations in textual form; shape grammars encode stylistic families as rule-based geometric transformations; the domain-specific language encodes spatial relations as logical predicates.</pre>

      <li>&quot;As described in chapter 1 and 3 of this book we need one such language or semantics (Krippendorf, 2005) to develop our thinking in this area, to expand our current body of knowledge, and to guide design projects in this area. In other terms, there is a need for “an architectural register for interaction” capable of coping with the emergent area of interactive architecture. One such semantics should be able to describe, analyze, and even inspire and guide design of new interactive architectures through concepts like “textures for momentary escapades”, “Interaction landscapes” and “interaction datum”1.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The notion of “Interactive architecture” (e. g. Bullivant, 2005; Fox &amp; Kemp, 2009) bridges in itself two design traditions, i. e. design of interactive systems (e. g. Benyon, 2004) on the one hand, and traditional architecture (e. g. Ching, 2007) as the tradition of designing our built environment on the other hand. As such, this emerging area, in which digital technologies are used as one design material (Vallgårda &amp; Redström, 2007) amongst other materials in the creation of new built environments, challenges the traditional approach to systems design, as well as the methods applied to arrive at well-grounded digital solutions.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The method as proposed in this book is not a tool for addressing this gap. However, it juxtaposes perspectives from the fields of architecture and human-computer interaction. By borrowing a set concepts from the field of architecture to discuss and address interactive architecture, we can challenge a set of architecturally rooted concepts from an interaction design perspective in an attempt to refine concepts with roots in both the field of architecture, and in interaction design, i. e. an architectural register for interaction.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Astated reason far doing this is to promote comparison across different pattern examples and to draw out generic pattern overviews. Many ofthe fields used in their pattern structure share concerns with different Loeales Framework aspects. Crabtree et al (2002) extend the use of descriptive patterns in their work on domestic environments to support the &quot;elaboration of a design space through the identification of discrete application areas. &quot;&quot;[(auth.), Geraldine Fitzpatrick *The Locales Framework: Understanding and Designing for Wicked Problems*. Springer Netherlands, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;In general, this kind of work promises to impact architecture on a variety  of levels. First, by making the designer’s workflow more integrated: from  conception, to representation, to material realization as data manipulated within  the software environment will be directly employed in the design stage—for  example, through rapid manufacturing. On a disciplinary level the implications  of moving from the frictionless and material-less space of current software  204 ﻿Digital Architecture Beyond Computers to a voxel-based one are profound and could mark a radical departure from  boundary-defined architecture firmly relying on geometrical reductivism toward  more continuous, processual notion of space.&quot;[INPUT: Bottazzi - 2020 - Digital architecture beyond computers fragments of a cultural history of computational design.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;One school proposes patterns as a retrospectively-derived resource to capture recurring design problems, grounded in existing studies of work and associated design solutions. These patterns then become a shared language for design (Erickson, 2000). Another school proposes an adapted patterns framework where the emphasis is on providing a descriptive framework for presenting findings; a structured template sensitises researchers/ethnographers to the needs of design and helps them structure their findings accordingly (Crabtree et al.&quot;[(auth.), Geraldine Fitzpatrick *The Locales Framework: Understanding and Designing for Wicked Problems*. Springer Netherlands, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;This was one of the first explicit attempts by social scientists (in collaboration with computer scientists) to draw out such a high-level conceptual structure relevant to design. Because this work is very sirnilar to the Locales Framework, I will discuss it further in Chapter 9. It is interesting to see this pattern repeated when social scientists and designers work closely together, as with the more recent MIME project 15 looking at media in the domestic environment (Diggins et al. , 2001). The ethnographers and designers developed a structured representation for data called a Grounded 40 LOCALES FRAMEWORK Innovation Map, organising data into concepts around design-relevant nodes of time, people, things, and space.&quot;[(auth.), Geraldine Fitzpatrick *The Locales Framework: Understanding and Designing for Wicked Problems*. Springer Netherlands, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Figure 8. 1 Albert Farwell Bemis, The Evolving House, Vol. 3 (1936). Successive diagrams  showing how the design of a house can be imagined to take place “within a total matrix of  cubes” to be delineate by the designer through a process of removal of “unnecessary” cubes.  184 ﻿Digital Architecture Beyond Computers 4 and 20 inches in size). The block could be compared to the cubelet, which was  here conceived not only as a proportioning system for the overall design but also  as an ornamental and technological one (yet, not structural ones as both houses  employ concrete frames). The addition of ornamental patterns to the block  was important not only for their aesthetic effect, but also because they began  to reveal the spatial potentials unleashed by conceiving space and structure  through a discretized language, a preoccupation still shared by contemporary  digital designers.  &quot;[INPUT: Bottazzi - 2020 - Digital architecture beyond computers fragments of a cultural history of computational design.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The computational choice of the formal enterprise ( l a , d) remains unchanged also for a more comprehensive, semantically and historically conscious account of language. The experience of the generative program, in combination with developing cognitive studies of multiple denominations, has shown that duplicate modes of understanding, formal and functional, monadic and social, are extremely fruitful and thus indispensable in any reformed linguistic picture. Yet the considerable theoretical divergence between formalism, psychologically anchored cognitivism, functionalism, and social interaction, indicates right away that the resulting comprehensive theoretical architecture for language will necessarily be composite.&quot;[Wanner, Dieter *The Power of Analogy: An Essay on Historical Linguistics*.

<li>&quot;Attribute-definition on such grammars may lead to a very natural declarative language for problem solving in terms of relevant structures. Abstract . A technique of formal definition, based on relations between lJattri- butes lJ associated with nonterminal symbols in a context-free grammar, is illustrated by several applications to simple, yet typical, problems.&quot;[Ed, and Ed Dold Eckman *Symposium on Semantics of Algorithmic Languages*. Berlin, New York: Springer-Verlag, 1971.]</li>
<li>&quot;We should ponder that briefly, for this may seem incoherent from the traditional perspective of formal languages, which will be discussed more thoroughly in section 7. 2. In classical terms, where language is considered a set of well-formed formulas, if a chunk of structure has reached, say, transformational complexity, then the corresponding language has that generative power. It is equally effective to propose an analysis as in (36b) within this language or to do things in more customary, phrasal, terms.&quot;[Uriagereka, Juan *Syntactic Anchors: On Semantic Structuring*. Cambridge University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;In this respect we refer to the literature on model theory. Programming languages. All languages hitherto discussed are of static character inasmuch as there are spatially and temporally independent truth values for given valuations w in a structure A. But one can also connect a ﬁrst-order language L in various ways with a programming language having dynamic character and aiming at the description of certain types of information processing. The choice of L depends on what the programming language is aiming at.&quot;[Rautenberg, Wolfgang *A Concise Introduction to Mathematical Logic*. 3rd. Springer, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;in the real-world appearance of linguistic shapes. Since change is a very concrete option in language, the linguistic individual&#x27;s knowledge of grammar must minimally depend on a co-determination by shape instead of atomistic principles alone, introducing gradually structured data (specific forms and form types) alongside categorical differentiations (parametric switches). A difference between two linguistic stages set far apart in time may be sufficiently deep to attribute them to a parametric switch, e. g.&quot;[Wanner, Dieter *The Power of Analogy: An Essay on Historical Linguistics*. Mouton de Gruyter, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Active research in general purpose user interfaces is now focusing tools for automatically building widget based applications from high-level descriptions. The pioneering work in this area was done in the middle 1980s by Apollo Computer Corporation in what is now known as their MOTIF system. Recently, Apollo has agreed to work on making this technology widely available pOSSibly through a specification that may become industry standard. Current work focuses on specifying interfaces using a combination of a special purpose language description for specifying the interaction and control of widgets and interactive editors for layout and prototyping.&quot;[Barnes, Timothy J., David Harrison, A. Richard Newton, and Rick L. Spickelmier (auth.) *Electronic CAD Frameworks*. Springer US, 1992.]</li>
<li>&quot;A rewriting rule changes a homogeneous rectangular subpicture into an isometric one tiled with speciﬁed tiles. Derivation and language generation with TRG rules are similar to context-free grammars. A normal form and some closure properties are presented. We prove this model has greater generative capacity than the tiling systems of Giammarresi and Restivo and the grammars of Matz, another generalization of context-free string grammars to 2D.&quot;[de Luca, A., F. Mignosi, D. Perrin, and G. Rozenberg (eds.) *Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 340, Issue 2, Pages 179-456 (27 June 2005), The Art of Theory*. 2011.]</li>
