      <li>&quot;wall 2001 As thin as possible: fantasy of the  two-dimensional wall, sketched in 3D by  SANAA for the Kunstlinie Almere,  Netherlands. PAGE 3 WALL The meaning of the wall is just as diverse as the uses of vertical surface can be, but there are at least two essential  functions: providing structure and dividing space. The two can be separated, and thus the category of &#x27;wall&#x27; divides into  two: the bearing wall, separating roof from ground; and the partition wall, organizing movement within the resulting  container. The former, it would seem, is as stable as the human need for shelter; the latter as changeable as our forms  of sociability. &quot;[INPUT: wall.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;PAGE 20 WOVEN WALL The ur-wall is not, according to  19th century architectural theorist  Gottfried Semper, a mud or stone  line of enormous and reassuring  heft, but an artful, woven partition.  Hanging loosely, perhaps flapping,  the woven screen generates-   and, crucially, symbolizes -   the division and organization of  activities within the primitive dwelling. The woven &quot;wall&quot; is an enabler  of civilization; the thick structural  wall merely a defender of it. &quot;[INPUT: wall.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Practically, however, the two modes of action are always in some sort united. Again, the weight to be borne may either act generally on the whole wall surface, or with excessive energy on particular points: when it acts on the whole wall surface, the whole wall is generally supported; and the arrangement becomes a continuous rampart, as a dyke, or bank of reservoir.&quot;[Ruskin, John *The Stones of Venice: The foundations*.

<li>&quot;In place of this a bonding transverse “wall” (itself of two faces and a core) can be built across the structure—obviously such a device is more proper to “engineering” structures, where special strength and stability is required (e. g. dams). It should be noticed also that this transverse bonding not only ties the wall together, but it also compartmentalises the core and thus reduces its outward pressure on the wall face (ABADY IV 1987 pp.&quot;[Wright, G.R.H. *Ancient Building Technology, Volume 3: Construction (2 vols.)*.

<li>&quot;Yet, wall C integrates the remains of a remarkable, obviously even earlier structure (Wall C1), most of which had already been destroyed or dismantled when the construction of wall C was started. Here, we get a glimpse of the concepts of a medieval “building in the historical context”. 3. 2 Definition of structural criteria for masonry of wall C1 The question of when Wall C1 could have been built cannot be answered in Baku itself, since no directly comparable constructions or construction techniques have been discovered here so far.&quot;[Le Brun, Nicolas *Building knowledge, construction history. 2 vols.

<li>&quot;It should be noted that from limited excavations it is not necessarily clear whether the primary purpose of~ heavy wall at the crest of a slope is a defensive city wall or a retaining wall, a terrace wall (cf. Neolithic jericho v. Duj; pp. 66-67. EB Megiddo v. TA rg77, pp. 79 ff. ). In fact very often a wall must have served both 76, 78 URBAN FOR TIFICA TIONS-W ALLS 86 purposes-acting as a retaining wall in its lower parts and as a defensive wall above (cf.&quot;[Wright, G.R.H. *Ancient Building in South Syria and Palestine*.

<li>&quot;6, 7), although in this case the outer wall was not constructed as a separate entity but was built in units as the outer wall of a given house.

<li>&quot;The western half of Wall C contains a ca. 16 m long fragment of a very specific wall structure (Wall C1, see Fig. 2), preserved in up to two stone courses of its regular masonry.

<li>&quot;1994:150, fig. 3). In Building 700 at Tall Jawa, a stone pier wall supports one end of a lintel over a doorway between Rooms 712 and R713 (see below). This same construction technique was used at Busayra, where a “pier” wall (90) bonds with the outer wall, and serves as a cross wall between two rooms (Bienkowki 2001: fig. 3; 2002: fig. 4. 5). While this technique is also used in casemate wall systems, what is of interest here is its use in domestic structures.&quot;[Daviau, P. M. Michele, Paul-Eugene Dion, Ronald G. V.

<li>&quot;Cavity walls. This type of construction is now very common and is generally preferred to solid wall construction for many types of buildings, especially houses. A cavity wall is usually an external wall. It consists of two separate walls of brickwall, having a cavity between, and connected together by metal ties. 62 Notes: bar стержень cavity wall bond retaining wall подпорная стенка сцепление longitudinal продольный пустотелая (полая) стена shear stress срезывающее напряжение tensile растягивающий tie wire проволока weave - wove – woven плеcти 63 элемент, работающий на растяжение expanded metal просечно-вытяжной металлический лист 64 C. 3.&quot;[Г.И., Железнякова *Civil Engineering Часть 1*. 2017.]</li>

<li>&quot;[16, 17] This wall is the line of support where many of the transfer beams mentioned above terminate and ﬁnd bearing surface. The wall is approximately 7. 5 meters long. At the bottom portion of this wall is a bookcase, a low horizontal wood unit measuring approximately 1. 12 meters high by 5 meters in length, sheathed with sliding glass doors.

<li>&quot;• At the fa£ade of one building, there was a veneer-clad wing wall above a fourth floor terrace area. This wall was topped with coping stones, with the top of the wall angled downward toward the exterior. There was a concrete beam running along the top of the wall (below the coping and veneer). A coping stone was removed from this wall to observe the anchorage of the coping and the condition at the wall cavity.&quot;[(Editors), Paul A. Bosela 7 Norbert J.

<li>&quot;This research tries to obtain a reliable evaluation from an experimental programme on masonry wall components and wall system. The structural behaviour of the stone masonry wall depends very much on the mechanical characteristics of its components, namely the stone and the mortar. Furthermore, the structure of the wall such as single leaf, double-leaf of cavity wall with rubble infill significantly affects its load capacity and failure mode.&quot;[(ed.), S.
