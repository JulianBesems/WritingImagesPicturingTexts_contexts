    <pre>The floor is a site of the body in extremis. In tragic history plays and epics, at the point of climax, characters must keel over or fall over backwards onto the floor. In making object form, the floor is a medium of active forms that organize interplay and interdependence with spatial consequence. Floor coverings If floor coverings are to be used, a person must choose between carpeting, area rugs, or hard coverings, known as resilient floors. Carpeting helps unify the entire room. We identify ourselves with this space, this place, this moment and these dimensions become ingredients of our very existence. Architecture is the art of reconciliation between ourselves and the world, and this mediation takes place through the senses. Mornings in ground and first Hoar, afternoon in ventilated basement. Vertical nomadism And when I stepped onto the area of clean fresh floor in the art gallery I was concerned that I had maybe stepped onto something that did not have the same solid firmness as the proper floor. A drawing representing a horizontal section taken above a floor to show, diagrammatically, the enclosing walls of a building, its doors and windows, and the arrangement of its interior spaces.

<em>The lines of the floor, like those of the body, are not arbitrary, but rather the result of a negotiation between gravity and the forces that resist it. As I walked across the gallery, I felt the subtle give of the floor, a gentle yielding that was both reassuring and unsettling. The floor, like the body, is a site of tension and release, of push and pull, of give and take.</em></pre>
