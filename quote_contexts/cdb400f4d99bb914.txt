Selected: In designing architecture, you are not only designing a non-human, non-organic space; you are also dealing with a physiological, biological space. The interior atmosphere of a space affects us greatly, and if we don’t get enough light, we fall ill. Our intention for the project was to shift our view of architecture from a non-organic, almost Cartesian one, to something more atmospheric. Anyone inside a given space is biologically entangled in that surrounding. Our starting point is that space isn’t Â�empty at all, but, invariably, has a particular atmosphere with its own biological, electromagnetic and chemical qualities.[Roesler, Sascha, and Madlen Kobi *The Urban Microclimate as Artifact: Towards an Architectural Theory of Thermal Diversity*.

02. "This used a variety of glass types, ranging from clear to opaque, and of varying tones. Under a uniformly illuminated ceiling of white fabric the effect was of shimmering, translucent space. 30 The Exhibition House constructed at the German Building Exhibition in Berlin in 1931, ‘Die Wohnung unserer Zeit’, is a particularly effective demonstration of these ideas applied to the design of a full-scale house (Figure 2. 28). Within the enclosure of the exhibition hall the project was liberated from all of the conventional demands of environmental shelter, but the beautifully composed image of the living space, without fireplace or light fittings, combines the quality and abstraction of both photomontage and the Glass Room."[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]

03. "The very act of constructing even in the simplest building creates an interior space, physically separated and distinct from the outside, yet also separated socially in terms of how spaces operate and are ascribed meaning. A building’s structure is, therefore, key not only in the obvious way that without it there would be no building, but in terms of how buildings are perceived and understood. As such, all modes of building structure have achieved architectural significance beyond that simply related to their function."[Hopkins, Owen *Reading Architecture  A Visual Lexicon*. Laurence King, 2012.]

04. "Factors that help to induce a sense of ‘place’, therefore, are given particular consideration. One of the most effective of these factors is light, to the extent that light and space are inseparable and that when light is eliminated from a space the emotional content of space disappears. The essence of architectural space lies in the interaction of the elements that define it. We can observe the relevance of the indivisible interplay of space and light in the case of the courtyard house."[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor & Francis Group, 2006.]

05. "The colours have to succeed in three different light conditions, as well as work with varying styles of architecture. In the sitting area (left), they need to be strong enough to create an intimate atmosphere; in the simpler dining area (below left), light and modern enough to enhance the space; and in the kitchen, the right level of colour to complement the more embellished walls. ONE COLOUR OR ONE GROUP OF NEUTRALS Creating a flow through the home can, of course, be easily achieved with just one colour."[Studholme, Joa, and Charlotte Cosby *Farrow & Ball How to Decorate: Transform Your Home with Paint & Paper*. Mitchell Beazley, 2016.]

06. "Le Corbusier decided to place different types of glass in these openings: clear glass, coloured glass, and glass painted with simple motifs, some of which bear inscriptions of praise to the Holy Virgin. The architect’s decision to use clear glass and to splash only a few precise places with touches of colour corresponds to his wish to keep a tight rein on the use of light – a primordial element in the definition of the interior volumes. The colours employed are the same as those for the door: blue, red, yellow, green and violet."[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]

07. "Colour can also modify an architectural space or indeed completely transform it. In creating an atmosphere, colour plays an active part and was employed in this work by the architect to characterise certain points of the interior space: here colour is not a mere addition, but rather an element of the architecture itself, or indeed still more, for it is a functional component of the architecture, understood and employed for its spatial value and psychological impact."[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]

08. "The use of glass imposes new solutions … I discovered by working with actual glass models that the important thing is the play of reflections, and not the effect of light and shadow as in ordinary buildings. 3 It is, perhaps, significant that Mies’ discussion of the design was in terms of structure and its expression, of ‘new forms’ developing from ‘new problems’, rather than from any argument for the environmental benefits that might be bestowed by the glass envelope."[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]

09. "The eye moves anxiously, as it is bounced back from reﬂective mirrors only to be freely released by immaterial glass surfaces. Clear glass can dissolve enclosure and containment by its invisibility. As polite observers do not want to leave ﬁngerprints, glass surfaces stand untouched and removed from engagement. Nevertheless, no one can argue against the presence of daylight that is so desirable and appreciated within interior space."[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]

10. "Unusually, the owners wanted an uncompromising, pristine living space that they could enjoy specifically for its design qualities, and that would not have a lived-in atmosphere. “I wanted to keep my house like a showroom,” said Mrs Kawahara. Designing from the materials outwards, Kondo went to great lengths to achieve originality. The floor covering, pale green with a slight translucency evident in the staircase, is a recycled glass product used for high-voltage insulators, and is used in it its natural colour."[Nose, Michiko Rico, and Michael Freeman *Japan modern: new ideas for contemporary living*. Periplus Editions (HK) ltd., 2005.]

11. "An aesthetic of refined transparency and exposed structure is apparent throughout the building (Figure 11. 1). The project incorporates several novel facade elements important to the building architecture, but the signature element is the climate wall: a fully glazed curving double-skin facade. The curve is comprised of segmented flat glass units. In addition, a four-story atrium space reached through a sweeping corridor from the main entry features a 70 ft (21. 3 m) tall glass wall and skylight roof."[Patterson, Mic *Structural Glass Facades and Enclosures : a Vocabulary of Transparency*. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, 2011.]

12. "Transparency becomes an effect of the interplay of light, structure, and membrane. Structure and Membrane A long-span glass facade is perceived in layers of membrane and structure. The glass skin, even a skin of the most optically clear glass, is not transparent after all, but a reflective, semitransparent luminescent membrane involved in a complex interaction with the surrounding environment: sky, buildings, streetscape, and people. This is the dynamic beauty of the material. Were it possible to make glass truly transparent, to make it disappear, the perception of membrane would be lost along with much of the engaging aesthetic of the glass facade."[Patterson, Mic *Structural Glass Facades and Enclosures : a Vocabulary of Transparency*. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, 2011.]

13. "Airy and light, purposeful and calm, this transformed industrial space is a fine example of design that takes into account the movement and motion of everyday life. A glass roof and sliding glass doors bring maximum light into the room; the seating area is designated by a raised platform of larch wood."[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]

14. ". . natural light gives mood to space by nuances of light in the time of day and the season of the year as it enters and modifies the space’ (see Figure 1. 1). Figure 1. 1 Kimbell Art Gallery in Fort Worth, Texas, designed by Louis Kahn. Daylight enters through skylights with reflectors, while incandescent lighting illuminates the walls 2 Daylighting and window design Figure 1. 2 Daylight brought into the centre of the John Lewis store, Kingston, to provide natural colour Daylight is even more critical in some types of buildings — for example, design studios where the ability to judge colour accurately is important."[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*. Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, 1999.]

15. "Glass has become invisible. Thus, the inherent properties of glass, along with its technical capabilities, allow designers to choose the degree of material presence of glass. 82 The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture Glass can “reﬂect, bend, transmit, and absorb light” (Bell 2006: 14). Manipulating these inherent characteristics of reﬂectance, transmittance and absorbency alters the experience of light through glass. Glass windows and enclosures fracture sensory experience into distinct perceptions."[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]

16. "However, as the light fades, the colour on the panelling will feel stronger, creating a more cocoon-like space. THIS PAGE The simplicity of this space makes it so appealing for sitting in and working. No artwork is required on this expansive wall, which is painted in ‘Cornforth White’, because the extraordinary top light creates shadows of rare beauty. These, together with the paint colour, will change and excite throughout the course of the day. FACING PAGE FACING PAGE Few rooms are filled with such enormous amounts of natural light as this Parisian example."[Studholme, Joa, and Charlotte Cosby *Farrow & Ball How to Decorate: Transform Your Home with Paint & Paper*. Mitchell Beazley, 2016.]

17. "Here, three arrowheads are stacked above each other. 56 Building Types › High-Rise Buildings Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, Seagram Building, New York City, 1958. Glass curtain wall A non-load-bearing enclosure or envelope of a building, attached to the structure but standing separate from it. Glass has the benefit of allowing light to penetrate deep into a building. See also Walls and Surfaces, p. 99. Spandrel panel A spandrel panel is the usually opaque or semi-opaque part of a curtain wall between the head of one glass pane and the bottom of the one immediately above."[Hopkins, Owen *Reading Architecture  A Visual Lexicon*. Laurence King, 2012.]

18. "Rather than the vaulted aesthetic of a single material system of TWA, the Valencia building uses glass as an enclosing material which avoids the need to add layers to an equivalent concrete shell. The use of bolt fixed glazing with steel supporting ribs linked back to the concrete ribbed structure creates an MCH_ 38 approach of mixing materials where the concrete frame and the glass enclosure are part of a single idea of using animal skeletons as a metaphor for the design. Calatrava’s interest in anthropology led him to consider the relationship of bone and muscle to use two materials in an interdependent way rather than the more straightforward ‘layered’ approach of traditional construction."[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*. Ambra Verlag, 2013.]

19. "A design approach of designing inwards from the facade of the building, and outwards from the internal spaces of the building, could allow structure to create interstitial space between inside and outside. This approach can also create environmental ‘buffer’ spaces, which are not maintained at the internal temperature of the building but serve as a buffer between inside and outside temperature conditions."[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*. Ambra Verlag, 2013.]

20. "A connection to nature is a fundamental part of the design. To increase the flexibility of the house’s layout, the wall separating this room from the main space can be partially or totally removed. Glass can be added, as shown here, to increase the light in the room and connect it visually with the rest of the house. The kitchen elements are built into the wall inside the technical module. This allows for more floor space and also makes connection to water and plumbing easy. Arcgency, situated in Copenhagen, Denmark, designed this prototype container house as part of their goal to design Resource Conscious Architecture (RCA)."[Koones, Sheri *Prefabulous World: Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Homes Around the Globe*. Abrams, 2014.]

21. "Direct or reflected sunlight is excluded from both illuminances. Use of the design of the building itself — form, orientation, construction, plan and section — to exploit both solar energy (in the form of sunlight, daylight and natural ventilation) and other physical phenomena (such as the stack effect) to create comfortable internal conditions throughout the year and to use less energy in doing so. Light shelf Possible sunlight hours A horizontal reflecting component forming part of or fixed near the top of a window to reflect/bounce daylight onto the ceiling of the room/internal space."[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*. Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, 1999.]

22. "Against this type of structure and the kind of modernism it implied, Sert turned to vernacular or traditional building. The functions of the window (ventilation, view, and light) could be managed together in one aperture or separately, through the use of different elements."[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]

23. "Caroline lets the spaces explain themselves. “I start with white walls, eliminating all dividing walls and partitions, which means that pieces of well-chosen furniture are then enough to structure the space. ” It sounds easier than it is: to let the furniture define the space and, indeed, become the design and decoration needs an extremely good—and disciplined—eye. Luckily the combined eyes of Caroline and Patrice are just that. They happily group pieces together from different artisans and artists whom they feel are important in the history of design."[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]

24. "• Position, type and colour of coating • Colour of base glass Use of Glass in Buildings 50 Amount of light reflected depends on: • Amount of incident light • Type and position of coating While from the technical standpoint, performance requirements and costs should narrow down the available choices, the selection is often influenced by the visual appeal of glass in interiors or exteriors. The selection of glass for a particular application from aesthetic point of view is largely a matter of designers preferences & owners choice."[Garg, N.K. *Guidelines for Use of Glass in Buildings*.
