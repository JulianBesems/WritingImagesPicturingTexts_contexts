However as Ishigami puts it, this computerisation does not merit a distinguishment of the base and the output, they should be working simultaneously. The architect should still be equally invested in the output, and not merely the creation of systems through mathematical formulations. Parametric design, through its system based control over the output, \u201creduces to numbers, the infinites and self-reflections\u201d."}
