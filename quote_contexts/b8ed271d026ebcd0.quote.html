<li>&quot;It also costs – in time and money – so sometimes “that’ll do” becomes your own version of perfect. My husband calls it “adding to the story” of the house, which involves creating a narrative behind every oddity, obvious difference, hiccup or seemingly questionable decision. But honestly, most of the time, no one will notice these things unless you mention them.&quot;[*Australian House &amp; Garden* 2017.]</li>

<li>&quot;In addition, most works in this group represent sequences of events that take place in chronological time. They tell stories. Usually, the time taken by the performance differs from the time taken by the events it represents. A play that lasts two hours might represent events that occur over twenty years. A dance that lasts five minutes might represent the week-long life of a butterfly.&quot;[O’Brien, Dan (ed.) *Gardening: Philosophy for Everyone- Cultivating Wisdom*.

<li>&quot;The book is written, chapter one to the end, in regular progress through the years. Even if you go in for sleights of hand like flashbacks or Tristram Shandy, there is no way of conveying in words the difference between child time and grown-up time, and the different pace of time in the different stages of an adult’s life.

<li>&quot;I want this stage in life to last forever!But realistically, I need to just celebrate a job well done as I begin to let go and release my sons into the world.

<li>&quot;She loved people and always had a great time. Mom and I had a lot of fun doing it together. There are a lot of parties and a lot of shopping. And the moms get invited to everything. So every time there was a luncheon, Mom and I would go to lunch together. And the parents really do a lot of the partying, too. A lot of people who debuted with me had gone to Newman, Sacred Heart, Country Day and St. Martins.&quot;[O&#x27;Neill, Rosary *New Orleans Carnival Krewes: The History, Spirit and Secrets of Mardi Gras*.

<li>&quot;Lester was their third son who slipped on the ice and broke his hip the day before Christmas in 1966; a few months later he could not walk at all. A bone in his leg deteriorated at the same time that his mind began to crumble. &quot;I guess that was the first time I&#x27;d stayed away from home in a long, long time,&quot; said Chester. His remark was like an echo from the distant past, for we all knew that Ruth had twice run away from their stormy marriage, leaving some of her children behind in her haste and hiding from Chester for six months the second time.&quot;[Jones, Michael Owen *Craftsman of the Cumberlands: Tradition and Creativity*.
