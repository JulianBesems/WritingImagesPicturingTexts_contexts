Selected: I glanced around to see who else noticed this phenomenon. Most of the thousands surrounding me pressed into one another’s backs, navigating a cluttered horizon of heads and shoulders. Meanwhile, only a handful of people were stopped. They looked like oracles, standing still in the moving crowd, their faces upturned. I craned my neck and joined them, my eyes climbing rungs of innumerable birds. We were the lucky ones. We happened to look up and witness an event so blindingly extraordinary that most people could not see it.[Childs, Craig *The Animal Dialogues*. Little, Brown and Company, 1997.]

Despite her slightness and her pretence of helplessness (carefully cultivated, I suspected), Melissa was tough. A survivor. She took what life threw at her and came up smiling.

The projector fell silent behind me, and light rose from several wall sconces. I looked through the window, and it was true: I couldn't see anything beyond the edges of Mr. Crane's garden. I could make out the shimmer of water far off without a roofline or streetlight between, and I took that water to be the ocean, all the way on the other side of the city, but after all he'd just told me, how could I be sure?"[Himmer, Steve *The Bee-Loud Glade*. Atticus Books, 2011.]

05. "But as they sped toward the light at the end of the tunnel, Doc could see an illumination rising up from behind them, reflected on the backs and shoulders of the others. He looked back and saw a roiling, riotous mass of shifting color filling the chamber and rushing at them, felt its obscene heat speeding toward them. Fire, fire made up of flares. “Tina!Enid!” Cal shouted, not slowing. Christina concentrated, and her aura intensified, spread out to enclose them. Enid grabbed up his guitar from around his back and began playing for all he was worth, incredible, gorgeous riffs of power."[Zicree, Marc *Magic Time: Ghostlands*. Harper Voyager, 2005.]

HYDROPHOBIA ‘CLOSE YOUR EYES and tell me what you hear,’ Lok See said quietly.

Harry could hardly keep himself from ducking back below the parapet, though in that light and through the dense canoe birch, it was impossible they could be seen. “Come up here on hill no good in dark.

08. "And out from the fire billowed a pillar of smoke, gray and thick, and I swear, I swear, it towered so high it fell back down on itself and from the light of the fire I could see the shape of a thick gray mushroom in the sky.

A shadow what I swear I saw climb out from the center of the fire and appear to me for just an instant against the surging orange backdrop of flame."[Knox, Tyler *Kockroach: A Novel (P.S.)*. 2008.]

09. "Kulg could not believe his ears. It was the order to fall back. Lurra raised her eyes to the horizon, taking note of the columns of smoke in the distance, of the craters and swarms of invading hostiles as far as the eye could see. She met her mate’s gaze and they shared a moment of perfect understanding. There was no purpose in retreating. They would fight together until their last breaths. What remained of the defense force was desperately trying to make it back to the illusion of safety that the city gates represented when a meteor careened right into the structures, sending rubble into the lines of soldiers and killing several."[Amber Fallon [Fallon, Amber] *TV Dinners from Hell*. Fresh Pulp Press, 2017.]

11. "“Look around you,” the voice was saying, “and see how late it is. Look and see the world ending in corruption and lust and man’s indifference. ” The suggestion seemed knowing. If you looked out at the suburb, you would see the littered walkways where nobody walked at night except addicts and muggers and drunks. There was better elsewhere, Bright told himself, and managed to turn his head on its stiff neck toward the portrait photograph. “Can you want the world to end this way?” the priest demanded. “Isn’t it true that you wish you could change it but feel helpless?"[Skipp, John, and Craig Spector *Book of the Dead*. Mark V Ziesing, 1990.]

12. "The darkness was less intense, more enjoyable. Moonlit nights were wonderful, particularly at the time of the full moon when everything was bathed in its silver light and we could see clearly. It seemed as if the only patches of darkness were the shadows cast by the moon. It was magical. I never strayed far from the hut without Hauke or the dogs, as it was often impossible to see far when snow flashed past in the turbulent winds. But twice a day, just before breakfast and again in the afternoon, we would make ourselves go outside, whatever the weather, and exercise."[Tieche, Marie *Champagne and Polar Bears: Romance in the Arctic*. Summersdale Publishers, 2007.]

These people who wanted to see the roof of their own house used the crowd below as a mirror. Those on the ground could see everything, they were shouting and waving their arms. Some were overjoyed, others were terribly angry."[Olesha, Yuri *The Three Fat Men*. 1969.]

14. "It had obviously been a very large house, a positive mansion. They could now see that about a quarter of the original roof had been destroyed. The blackened and charred beams told their own story of the fire. Ryan wriggled cautiously to the edge, peered down and saw that the building had originally been four stories high. "Lots trees," Jak observed, lying flat on his stomach alongside Ryan, the chill wind tugging at his fine white hair. It was a fair comment. As far as Ryan could see the house was surrounded by a rambling forest, reminding him of his own birthplace back in the blue-topped Shens of Virginia."[Axler, James *Deathlands 09 Red Equinox*. Gold Eagle, 1989.]

Because, as Dean looked skyward, he saw a great chariot of fire and aboard that chariot, the shape of something like a man. Trumpets sounded, a terrible multitude of them, a great shrieking air raid that threatened to cave Dean’s eardrums had he not shielded them with chocolate-streaked hands."[III, Carlton Mellick, Jeremy Robert Johnson, John Edward Lawson, D.

Jules was gesturing and saying something beside her, surrounded by a shining gold light that Anya found oddly comforting. Max hummed beside him, crackling in an orange-gold energetic flare."[Bickle, Laura *Sparks*. 2010.]

17. "The face of science as currently construed is a face that only a mathematician could love.

RosettaBooks, 2011.]

I could, I could, I could . . . Possibility became a drug. Bold and innocent, I felt it could lead me anywhere. So I let it. IN THE heat of that first European summer I found myself moving north to Edinburgh. Summer, strong and sunny, did not last for long. It burst in full bloom as I arrived, then retreated just as quickly. There was a sharp month of autumn when leaves turned crimson and shed into piles knee-deep."[Mathieson, Kate *Ways to Come Home*. Ventura Press, 2017.]

20. "After a while I could sense more than see an outline of something against the forest. The shape was constantly shifting, like tree leaves in a breeze. I could make it look however I wanted. “Yes, I see her!” I said to Heidi. With a voice of rustling leaves, Telonferdie began to tell us an ongoing story that always picked up where it left off the last time. It was woven of the details of the day-to-day—the names of animals and plants and the little worries in our hearts—together with the greater knowledge of the world that flows through all our brains."[Coleman, Melissa *This Life Is in Your Hands: One Dream, Sixty Acres, and a Family Undone*.

21. "They were perhaps ten yards away, close enough to hear the measured pattern of the women’s breath. Behind all that blood, the shreds of muscle and fat, Sarah could see they were beautiful. You could fall in love even as you were being ingested. ‘We’re not going to make it,’ Nick said. His eyes were egg-large. Snot was smeared across his upper lip. He was running just ahead of the girls, whipping his head around to look over Sarah’s shoulder every few seconds. Just as she was sure she could feel the hot sweet breath on her skin, the ghost of swiping fingers millimetres from purchase, someone wailed sorrowfully off to their right."[Williams, Conrad *The Unblemished*. Virgin Books, 2010.]

22. "Then Charley looked again toward the fire. “Go look but stay quiet now,” he said. “All right. ” Harry lurched along next to him, feeling the sweat on his forehead, under his arms, pouring down his thighs out of his crotch. Yet he was cold as well, shivering as if he had the watch in an arctic gale. Now they were no more than fifty yards from the fire. Here and there, clumps of high rushes rose above their heads, breaking their view. But Harry could see there was a tall ancestral pole with what looked a battered, weather-beaten image of a killer whale at its top, lit from below by the fire, which gave it a baleful look."[Whitehead, Harry *The Cannibal Spirit*. Hamish Hamilton Canada, 2011.]

23. "The gap I've been entering through for almost as long as I've had the garden, since the brambles were allowed to grow up around it. Back then I could see it from a long distance, and now some days I have to feel my way along the bush for the gap. Their tent filled the space like a dam on a river, and I stood outside its rustling, rippling fabric walls, frozen by the surprise. There are other gaps where I might have entered the garden, at least there were when I could still see well enough to look for them, but this was the one I'm used to, part of my routine."[Himmer, Steve *The Bee-Loud Glade*. Atticus Books, 2011.]

24. "From my perch on Papa’s shoulders I could see the fire pit glowing in the dusk and knew that soon the chords of a guitar would join the stars twinkling above.

It was a confidence you couldn’t help but love."[Coleman, Melissa *This Life Is in Your Hands: One Dream, Sixty Acres, and a Family Undone*. Harper, 2011.]

25. "Sparky hopped along beside her, with the little salamanders springing like grasshoppers behind them in the gravel and pieces of green slag. After what seemed like hours, a now-familiar rumble echoed in the distance. Anya moved to get off the tracks, calling for Sparky and the salamanders. She could feel the vibration in the metal. Charon stood on the tracks. “We can catch the train from here. ” Anya blinked stupidly. “On the tracks?” She could see the train lights in the distance."[Bickle, Laura *Sparks*. 2010.]
