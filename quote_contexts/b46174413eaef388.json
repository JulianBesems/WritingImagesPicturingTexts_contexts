The second domain, centered on text, serves as a hub for written content, where users can share their own writings, and engage with others through comments and discussions. By combining these two domains, users can create rich and diverse narratives that blend the visual and textual elements.", "suggest_context": "3.2 DOMAINS Domains in this context are the fields of information between which the projections take place, as well as those that establish said projections. In the architectural communication, domains could be understood as the ichnographic, orthographic and scenographic drawings. Here, given the focus on images and text, these will form the primary domains, with the third being a collection of documents that inherently contains both. The choice was made to have the interactions take place between two domains that can be seen as the generic, big enough to not be curated, and broad enough to be able to expose an exhaustive amount of information hosted by the writing. The projections between these two generics are however of a more precise nature, although we will explore the variety of scale within this as well. so contrary to this i propose to use modern digital methods and traditional architectural means."}
