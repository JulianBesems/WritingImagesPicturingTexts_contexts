Selected: While theorists and commentators of digital writing may have observed the “slip” to which Andrews refers, mainstream scholarship is persistently focused on linear, alphabetic, natural language texts. One of the ways in which this phonetic-linear inertia is being challenged, however, is through calls for a renewed emphasis on production or invention over the traditional concern for critique and analysis. As techniques and technologies for the production of texts SCRIPTED WRITING 81 become increasingly available and as a generation of influential voices in the humanities focuses on methods of invention over representational critique, there is a rising trend in current scholarship to blur the disciplinary lines that conventionally separate text from code.[Hawk, Byron, David M.

02. "Developing this research within the context of an art school (2002–2005), I am examining the ways in which storytelling, drawing, imaging and writing mediate the processes of situated learning. Specifically, I am concerned with how speech, gesture, graphic expression and written words all work together in specific contexts of interaction, highlighting both the coupling of perception and action and the role of narrative in artists’ and teachers’ working practices."[(ed.), Cristina Grasseni *Skilled Visions: Between Apprenticeship and Standards*. Berghahn Books, 2007.]

03. "Secondly, this example illustrates how written texts may be connected to other semiotic resources in the flow of activity. The example makes clear that interpreting how writing comes to mean one thing rather than another, in ac- 8. SPEAKING AND WRITING 227 tivity, involves tracing the articulation of written texts with other present “texts,” including gestures, speech, and even silence. Finally, this analysis illustrates the continuing challenge of integrating representations of talk, text, gesture, and action."[Bazerman, Charles, and Paul Prior *What Writing Does and How It Does It: An Introduction to Analyzing Texts and Textual Practices*.

04. "Introductions that deal with, or in a few cases concentrate on, written texts have looked exclusively at the textual product and not at the processes of production through which those texts were created. In this book, we treat both the writing and the text. Of course, no approach to discourse analysis can proceed without also considering contexts, and here again, we consider ways of analyzing the contexts of writing as well as the contexts of texts as received by readers."[Bazerman, Charles, and Paul Prior *What Writing Does and How It Does It: An Introduction to Analyzing Texts and Textual Practices*. Routledge, Lawrence Erlbaum, 2003.]

05. "But rhetoric today is a house divided. The most prominent fact of its institutional existence is that it has two primary homes, in departments of English and departments of communication. In this chapter, we argue both the intellectual and pedagogical cases for academic integration of traditionally separate “modes” of communication (oral, written, and visual). Our account centers on three curricular experiments underway at North Carolina State University: a first-year course in speaking and writing, a campus-wide program in speaking and writing across the curriculum, and a project to combine instruction in writing and visual communication in lab reports for science courses."[Petraglia, Joseph, and Deepika Bahri *Realms of Rhetoric: The Prospects for Rhetoric Education*. 2011.]

07. "To illustrate such process tracing, Prior presents a number of sample analyses of writing processes engaged in by graduate students and professors in several different fields. In chapter 8, Kevin Leander and Paul Prior explore speaking and writing, asking how talk and text interact. Leander and Prior examine the complex relationships between talk and text in context, considering ways that talk is transformed into, shapes, and occasions texts as well as the ways text is transformed into, shapes, and occasions talk."[Bazerman, Charles, and Paul Prior *What Writing Does and How It Does It: An Introduction to Analyzing Texts and Textual Practices*.

08. "Metz is often considered to be the discursive founder of the structuralist enterprise in fi lm. Revisiting Metz’s earliest publications reveals a more complex and often surprising picture, however, and yet another kind of project. In a group of texts published between 1964 and 1972, Metz marks out a conflicted conceptual space within structuralism—between the aesthetic discourse and the emergent discourse of signification, between phenomenology and semiology, between semiology and fi lm, and between sign and image— whose stakes are played out in the imagination and construction of theory."[Rodowick, D.

11. "The work of Ruiz de Mendoza Ibáñez (1999) on interactions between metonymy and metaphor includes mention of metonymy occurring within the source domain of a metaphor, and this amounts to a type of online sourcedomain inference. As for online withinpretence reasoning, Levin’s (1988) work on metaphor in literature implies the use of it, and van Dijk (1980) provides a tentative account of metaphor in terms of counterfactuals. The “blending” (“conceptual integration” approach) in Cognitive Linguistics (Fauconnier & Turner 1998), when applied to metaphor, makes inference within the blend-space central."[Jr., Raymond W. Gibbs *The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought*. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008.]

12. "In verbal metaphors, answering the first two questions is often considerably facilitated by language’s combination of linearity and syntactical rules, which help distinguish between grammatical subjects (“A”) and metaphorical predicates (“is B”). This makes it easy to assess the metaphoricity of, and difference between, say, the evergreens “butchers are surgeons” and “surgeons are butchers” (see Forceville, 1995 ). In pictures, however, particularly static ones, there is no such linearity, nor grammatical “rules” for disambiguating target and source, so that target and source must be identified as such on other grounds."[Jr., Raymond W. Gibbs *The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought*. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008.]

13. "These findings have implications for a strong view of metaphorical mapping, because they suggest that a one-to-one mapping of logical correspondences between entities is less common than sometimes assumed in the theoretical literature. In particular, they challenge an interpretation of conceptual metaphor theory that suggests that the target domain is largely constructed by source domain correspondences. Corpus data suggest that the inherent structure of the target domain does not only constrain the mapping, it helps to shape it."[Jr., Raymond W. Gibbs *The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought*. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008.]

14. "Because of its focus on the inferencing strategies used to derive readings from a text, a study of narrative coherence may also encompass research in text-linguistics and artificial intelligence. Again, the potential of these two approaches has been amply explored by stylisticians, samples of which are: de Beaugrande (1987); Van Peer (1987); Werth (1994). 127 Dialogue and drama: an introduction to discourse analysis • 5. 1 Introduction 130 • 5. 2 Dialogue and discourse 131 • 5. 3 Models for the analysis of discourse 143 • 5. 3. 1 The analysis of discourse structure 143 • 5. 3. 2 Discourse strategy: maxims and relevance 148 • 5. 3. 3 Discourse strategy: politeness phenomena 155 • 5. 4 Discourse analysis and drama dialogue 164 • 5. 5 Summary 174 Suggestions for further reading 176 • Chapter 5 Chapter 5 129 5. 1 Introduction This chapter explores the nature of dialogue."[Simpson, Paul *Language Through Literature: An Introduction (Interface)*.

15. "In telling a lie, details from each of these mental spaces will be integrated into the blend that makes up the participant’s language output. While, “the dynamic web of links between blend and inputs remains unconscious” (Fauconnier & Turner, 2002:57), analyzing a blend allows investigation of what elements are expressed in the created space. As Parrill & Sweetser (2004:202) point out in a study of gestural metaphor and blending, “in describing the mappings between elements in complex discourse this framework can be seen to be invaluable, as it allows the analyst to a build a coherent representation of the unfolding discourse structure. ” Expanding the study of gesture-speech mismatches through application of conceptual integration theory makes it possible to consider mismatches not as a divergence of channels, but rather as an expression of information from a composite blending of channels."[Duncan, Susan D., Justine Cassell, and Elena T. Levy *Gesture and the Dynamic Dimension of Language: Essays in Honor of David Mcneill (Gesture Studies)*. 2007.]
