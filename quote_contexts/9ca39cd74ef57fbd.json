The categories will be defined in terms of the relationships between the elements, and will enable the computation of the projections and searches within and across the domains. The way in which these categories are defined will be critical in determining the functionality of the system, as it will influence the ability to retrieve information from the different domains.", "suggest_context": "3.3 ELEMENTALS Now that we've established the material we'll be using, this chapter will discuss the ways in which the contents are resolved into their subsequent elements. These elements are what will act as the indices by which we will compute the projections and searches within and across the domains. We shall therefore here outline how these elements will act as symbolic representations for their domains, and how this representation is achieved through different ways of encoding the information. TEXT We will first discuss all elements from the text domain that will feature in WIPT. BOOK Even though not all of the documents included in the text domain the 1.1M documents described in 3.2.1 would normally be referred to as books, we will use the term book to refer to any of the highest order documents in the text domain in order to avoid confusion further on with the documents in the multi-modal domains.
