      <li>&quot;The editor frames writing as a constant movement: from text onto itself, and from text onto imagery. As a paragraph takes shape, it is projected into two public domains. In the text window, two floating panels return nearby passages: red for content-based correspondences, magenta for speculative continuations. In the figurative window, a constellation of images appears, arranged according to their blue figurative label indices. This colour scheme carries throughout the thesis: red marks the textual domain, blue stages the perpendicular figurative contexts. The result is that abundance remains playable in the time of writing, not a search session before or after. &quot;[INPUT: WritingImagesPicturingText_JBesems_Small300dpi.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The relationships between text and image were defined by R. Barthes as either “anchorage” or “relay” (1977: 39). In Anchorage words elucidate pictures. As Van Leeuwen puts it, “the text directs the reader through the signifieds of the image, causing the viewer to avoid some and receive others,” and “remote-controls him towards the meaning chosen in advance” (Van Leeuwen 2005: 229). In relay “text and image stand in complementary relationship and are both fragments of a more general syntagm to which each contributes its own distinct information” (Van Leeuwen 2005: 229).&quot;[Machin, David *Visual Communication*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Two conditions guide how this accompaniment is shaped. First, the contexts surfaced are indexical: existing passages and images that the editor brings into proximity. Where machine generated information is involved (magenta), it serves as a probe, not as a substitute for the material. Second, while the computational setup supports the inverse directions (image  image; image   text), the writing loop privileges text as the navigtaional action; the other directions are demonstrated separately and taken up later. &quot;[INPUT: WritingImagesPicturingText_JBesems_Small300dpi.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;While new routes and entry points are provided, the resources and experiences that the teacher draws on are different than if she were to start this discussion with a written or oral text – a shift in authority, a connection with a variety of experiences and knowledge outside of the cannon – new ways into the play. The ways in which imagery and writing appear in the English classroom has changed considerably over the past decade (Jewitt, Bezemer and Kress 2011). Through investigation of the relationship between image, writing, action and layout they show that image and layout are increasingly meshed in the construction of content.&quot;[Machin, David *Visual Communication*. 2017.]</li>

<li>&quot;For Bolter, this visual space is a natural territory through which he is able to articulate the visual language of assemblages of text and image and the new role for the ‘symbolic image’ (particularly in graphical user interfaces). The result of this apparently singular definition of the reading and writing space of hypertexts is that Bolter chooses examples of literary hypertext where there is an explicit relationship between visual images or diagrams and the text associated with them, or what he terms ‘image maps’.&quot;[Dade-Robertson, Martyn *The Architecture of Information: Architecture, Interaction Design and the Patterning of Digital Information*.

X-ray, the layout seems to suggest, while at the same time writing is both literalized as image and displaced beyond the envelope and image entirely. If such layouts asserted a power of imaging to make transparent what is concealed within a text’s figurative language, another photograph published several years earlier and the caption for the layout of which it is part connects the opacity of an image to the silence of language (figure 2. 18).&quot;[Schaefer, William *Shadow Modernism: Photography, Writing, and Space in Shanghai, 1925–1937*.

<li>&quot;The modern era defined image and writing—to come back to two of the basic media of Western culture—as specific monomedia: characteristic for the image, and not only in modern art history, is its “flatness” (Clement Greenberg), the two-dimensionality of a painted canvas—applied to drawings as well as photographs—that has been reflected, subverted, and transformed in modern art and modern technologies. Writing, or more precisely text, was considered even more abstract in a way: to be able to read a text, decode the symbols as words, sentences, speech, the graphic symbols of the alphabet have to remain “invisible”—the reader has to abstract their concrete visible form. 12 Jacques Derrida turned the attention of philosophy to writing as its own tool—a medium in terms of mediality: it is significant that we use writing and how we use it, but in a different way than the representational relation (signifier/signified) that writing or text suggests.&quot;[Herzogenrath, Bernd *Travels in Intermediality: ReBlurring the Boundaries*.

<li>&quot;In a civilization marked by the increasing prominence of the visual, we can expect a change in this hierarchical relationship of text to image. It is far from certain that coming generations dealing with mixed environments will read the text first, as we so often tend to do. On the contrary, feedback loops will proliferate between text and image, and there will be more influence between them, with the spectacularization of the text fragment and the textualization of the visual. Michel Butor, who was interested in painting and in the increasing prominence of the image in our environment, observed that the most sober newspapers have had to resign themselves to providing space for images. He concluded: “We see before us a new age of text. The text has now been freed from certain constraints, as much as the codex was in rela- tion to the volumen. We are truly at the dawn of a new age of humanity. ” The new culture of hypermedia has given rise to even more interaction between text and image.&quot;[Vandendorpe, Christian *From Papyrus to Hypertext*.

<li>&quot;He adapts Kress and van Leeuwen’s compositional model to explore theme development in a children’s book text alongside compositional features of the accompanying images (115ff. ). Text and image are not co-composed in his examples, however, and he does not attempt to map the structuring of the text to the organisation of the images, nor is he tracking items from image to image within the illustrated text. There is some cross-comparison between the thematisation of certain figures (their patterned recurrence in initial, theme position in the clauses) in the wording of the book he analyses, against the frequencies with which these figures appear in the illustrations (132ff.&quot;[Davies, Paul Fisher *Comics As Communication: A Functional Approach*. Palgrave Macmillan, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;As the New London Group (2000) and others have noted (Bezemer and Kress 2008; Kress 2000; Kress and van Leeuwen 2001), each semiotic mode has its own form of conveying meaning. For example, written text is linear, visual is spatial. Each has a different reading path created by the composer of the text. When image and writing are combined to form a single text, the meanings are multiplied (Lemke 1998) and image can illustrate or expand the written text (Barthes 1977). Exposure to multimodal composition provides opportunities to teach these forms and how to transform texts to meet curriculum and assessment requirements (Bezemer and Kress 2008). By including the explicit teaching of multimodal texts, teachers change their teaching practices (Zammit 2013).&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*. Springer Netherlands, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;If an image and a text are placed side by side, which one provides the context for the other?The answer will obviously vary with the nature of the text and of the painting, but it is more likely to be the text. In fact, it is enough to place a phrase beside an image for the image automatically to be seen as an illustration of that phrase—more or less reliable and more or less metaphorical. Even the title of a painting takes priority over the painting itself, as does any title in relation to the text below it.&quot;[Vandendorpe, Christian *From Papyrus to Hypertext*. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;7v and 15v). 29 Leonardo constantly sought to generate a double form of evidence through image and text, yet a degree of inexactitude is inherent to this double medium. Articulated in the inter-media space between image and text is the non-self-contained movement of a quest for the soul of flight (l’anima dell’uccello). From a contemporary point of view, the partial sketches of a flight machine in Sul volo degli uccelli look extraordinarily advanced (Figs.&quot;[(eds.), Matteo Valleriani *The Structures of Practical Knowledge*.

<li>&quot;In contrast to the wildness and strangeness of Bataille’s text, and his fascination with eros, death, and transcedendence, this “meme” is more like a tic, a symptom of just the kind of free-floating capitalist anxiety that Bataille would have despised. Surely if there is interest in this juxtaposition of image and text, it would be the challenge of accounting for how a complex and unique experiment in writing came to be so drastically reduced. This situation in which an image can be understood as a mistaken or simpleminded version of the theory it accompanies may seem to be rare in art writing: usually the image is the model.&quot;[Elkins, James, Kristi McGuire, Maureen Burns, Alicia Chester, and Joel Kuennen (eds.) *Theorizing Visual Studies: Writing Through the Discipline*. Routledge, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Students learnt about creating a hypertext and animations, making use of more visual resources available for conveying their messages. They used PowerPointTM in a more creative way than previously. Students in pairs also independently created paper-based multimodal texts about how the senses worked, with a written explanation and an image that illustrated the writing. The purpose of this task was to reinforce the learning of the written mode, due to the teachers concerns about the education system’s testing requirements, which includes students in year 3 and year 5 writing a text, not creating a multimodal text.&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*. Springer Netherlands, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Recall that a key issue in his meditation on writing is the destabilization of the privilege of speech over writing, a manifestation of the metaphysics of presence. This privilege seems confirmed as long as writing is nothing other than and nothing but the picture of speech. Derrida first demonstrates that, strictly speaking, a purely phonetic writing does not exist and then turns his attention to reading texts by emphasizing the nonphonetic content that always resides within any writing, including speech.&quot;[Hays, K.

<li>&quot;Multimodal studies 186 Carey Jewitt of literacy practices have served to highlight the importance of various aspects of English not accounted for within a linguistic approach. These aspects include the spatial organisation and framing of writing on the page, the directionality, shape, size and angle of a script (Kenner 2004), as well as the embodied dimensions of writing (Lancaster 2001), the interaction between image, graphical marks and writing (Pahl 1999), and the role of voice and the body (Franks 2003).&quot;[O&#x27;Halloran, Kay L, and Bradley A Smith *Multimodal studies : exploring issues and domains*.

<li>&quot;If vision reflects the information processing task of understanding a scene from its projected image, in the same way a theory of visual text processing may have a parsing component performing the task of assigning interpretation values to a text from its projected positioning. 97 Iconic Communication The task of a visual text processing language is to specifically proceed towards assigning signs and symbols to text segments in order to make communicative pattern recognition and context sensitive processing possible at the end.&quot;[Barker, Philip *Iconic Communication*. 2001.]</li>

<li>&quot;In other words, the “electronic text” acts like writing, but it is not like writing. What the placeless “electronic text” offers in place of the correlation that the book has perpetually offered is spatial and temporal challenges akin to those Ruskin foresaw in ornamental inscriptions. In the latter case, the text was physically present as ornamental form, whereas its sense was de facto displaced, if not dispensed with. The problem with the electronic text is the inverse—the sense is present, though the text actually and durably is not.&quot;[Ameri, Amir H *The Architecture of the Illusive Distance*. New edition.

<li>&quot;The anchorage is ideological. It remote controls the viewer toward a meaning chosen in advance. 14 By erasing and covering the Image with fragments of the text, the text becomes the aesthetic experience, still maintaining a connotative load. We project onto the new Image a preconceived Idea of what that text refers to. Our perceptions about the world we live In are reinforced by the conventions of representation that inundate us daily, and television&#x27;s particular mode of defining reality seems to be a dominant conditioning force within the culture.&quot;[Penny, Simon *Critical Issues in Electronic Media*.

<li>&quot;By expressing himself in such a way, Hugo gives proof of a rather modern way of conceiving the monument and the city, as a true text, as an inscription of man in space. This chapter by Victor Hugo is consecrated to the rivalry between two modes of writing, writing in stone and writing on paper. Indeed, this theme is very much current today in the remarks on writing of a philosopher like Jacques Derrida.&quot;[Leach, Neil *Rethinking Architecture: A Reader in Cultural Theory*.
