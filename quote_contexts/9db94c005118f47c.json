{"created_at": 1763160033.560041, "confirmed": true, "origin": "searched", "search_input": "", "suggested_query": "As such, the films are not only a repository of multi-modal data but also a testament to the power of personal taste in shaping the very fabric of our understanding of the world. By foregrounding the role of the individual in the curation of this dataset, we aim to challenge the notion that datasets must be universally applicable or representative of a particular genre, and instead argue that personal and idiosyncratic collections can be just as valuable in unlocking new insights and perspectives. In the following chapters, we will explore how the unique sensibility of this film collection can be leveraged to generate new forms of narrative and aesthetic expression, and how it can be used to bridge the gap between text and image domains.", "suggest_context": "Although the images are not purely photography, we argue this argument on indexical power can be extended to the general digital image, where the association of its contents can be traced to the fact that it is a digital trace of active curation. The instrument keeps that indexical trace intact while bracketing biography. In contrast to the continuous flow of contemporary generative imagery, this choice preserves a pre-specific relation to something that has happened, not something specified to be generated. Operationally, our use requirements are modest: we require scale, licence clarity, stable availability, and a compact metric for imageimage relations. PD12M satisfies the first three directly, and the fourth through its per-image CLIP vectors, which will be mobilised later on to stage adjacency and proportion within the image field. the PERSONALPRIVATE MULTI-MODAL As we have explained in the first two chapters, the ambition is to establish projections between modalities. And to demonstrate the possibility of making these projections specific, personal and curated. The datasets that will establish these multi-modal casts are thus chosen to be relatively small, and of a personal character. In rationale these selections are therefore opposed to that of the PUBLIC datasets, where generality and broadness were searched for in those, we approach these datasets from a personal point of view, or at least with the intent of them being of a particular quality or clear bias. FILM The first type of documents selected for the multi-modal casts are films with subtitles. These provide a naturally occurring multi-modal corpus: a juxtaposition of image and narrative text that is co-present but non-equivalent. Here, each frame articulates visual tone and scenographic presence, while subtitles render the spoken narrative. Crucially, only non-descriptive subtitle tracks are used to foreground narrative dialogue, eliminating external commentary or auditory cues. In total the film collection used throughout the thesis consists of 215 films, which provides the multi-modal cast used throughout the majority of the chapters. In the following chapters we will sometimes also work with smaller subsets, for instance by only taking films by one director e.g. Tarantino or studio e.g. Ghibli. The overall collection is the product of my personal taste in films, primarily comprised of films or series I have seen and enjoyed, with some films I've been meaning to watch for a long time but not had the chance yet. The choices also rest on a certain sense of aesthetic quality as well as historic relevance that I would ascribe to this collection, however this is of course a completely personal taste. The point is that it forms a sensibility which is not purely generic and through this allows for a tuning between the text and image domains that is particular to this personal taste. Acknowledging that another person would tune it differently, and thus establish a proportionality between the two domains which is distinct from this one."}
