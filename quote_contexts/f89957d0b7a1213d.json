This non-formalist stance extends to multimodal models like CLIP, where images and captions are mapped into a shared vector space and associated by proximity. Such systems work not by following specified rules about what an architectural faade or a public square is, but by internalising a vast, probabilistic sense of how such phrases and images tend to appear together. Mario Carpo has argued that digitally made objects are increasingly identified not by visual resemblance, but by the recognition of hidden patterns, on computational algorithms, or on other nonvisual features. In his example of credit cards, visual inspection gives way to algorithmic verification; authenticity becomes a function of a numerical sequence rather than an image. This shift from surface resemblance to encoded pattern is precisely what contemporary multimodal models operationalise. They do not simply store a geometric model or a textual description; they internalise correlations across billions of tokens and pixels. Architectural drawings, texts and photographs become points in such a space, linked by similarities that often exceed what a designer consciously specifies. This introduces a new kind of non-calculable. Where formal languages promise symbolic transparency at the cost of combinatorial tractability, and soft machines promise adaptability at the cost of explicit structure, contemporary models offer powerful pattern-recognition at the cost of interpretability. Their knowledge takes the form of distributed statistical structure, accessible only indirectly through prompts, projections and probes.
