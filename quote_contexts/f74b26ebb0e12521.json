Because the searches are acknowledged to always be partial they bring a further insight into the figurative screen as to which sorts of figurative features are brought to the foreground through their presence alongside the aspects by which they were projected.", "suggested_query": "The textual internal projection of playground onto text and the figurative playground onto text do not have any significant alignment based on the two textual screens comparing figures 3.5:2 and 3.5:10. However, this observation does not necessarily imply that playground is not a relevant index, but rather that the relationship between playground and the topics discussed on its background is more complex than initially expected. For example, playground is in the top 6 of most relevant figurative indices to playground, while playground is in the top 12 of most relevant textual indices to playground. This suggests that playground has a strong association with the figurative mode, but not with the textual mode.", "suggest_context": "6. Label: For each region Rj we record the peak index argmaxA in Rj This results in a variety of different divisions, sometimes very clearly fragmented like the first example, in some cases completely singular like with umbrella fig 3.5:7 or where the regions are less naturally distinct in which case the upper bound of coverages divides the large regions into multiple smaller ones like with night fig 3.5:8 and a mix between these as seen with beauty fig 3.5:9.

The reverse shows a further contrast compared to the textual internal projection of the topic of conversation. Where conversations about playgrounds onto the figurative and the playground as a figurative index projected on its own had a certain correspondence, at least in its primary region, the textual internal projection and the figurative playground onto text do not have any significant alignment based on the two textual screens comparing figures 3.5:2 and 3.5:10. From this we can clearly see the two aren't equivalent, nor are the projections reversible. But it also suggests that when a conversation revolves around a playground it does occur a significant amount of times that we also see a playground. However the topics that are discussed on the background of a playground do not have as strong a bias towards also mentioning a playground. An easier to measure metric is by showing that playground is in the top 6 of most relevant figurative indices to playground , while playground is in the top 12 of most relevant textual indices to playground . Looking at our other object type index umbrella within the figurative we see a relation to the conversation around: umbrella, wait, wind, rain, home, hurry, ready, garden, treasure, let, gremlin, brought, sky, live, already, studio, magic, great, grown, worry . As for the more intangible indices, a backdrop labelled with beauty hosts conversations on: afraid, believing, desk, laughing, description, respectability, grandson, several, seemed, saw, learned, whether, unsolved, alone, jump, tossing, accident, anyway, afternoon, picked . And a scene showing night foregrounds the spoken words of: good, let, lost, cold, minute, shop, along, excited, near, saw, dance, hate, around, drive, living, place, tired, home, look, car ."}
