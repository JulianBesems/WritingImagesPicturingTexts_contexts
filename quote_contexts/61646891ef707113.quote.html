    <pre>In all of this the window serves as the prop for discovering new and unexpected relationships between the inside and outside. This window, like any other, relies on mechanisms of operation, instruments of opening and closure. Fundamentally, glass is hard, yet fragile and brittle. An ingenious device to siphon daylight deeply into a building, this glazed opening serves also to share illumination between rooms demanding acoustic separation, so as to spread light in a peaceful way, free of disrupting noise.

<em>The play of light on the window&#x27;s surface, refracting the colors of the outside world, creates a dynamic interplay of contrasts and nuances that can evoke the passage of time, the fleeting nature of life, and the beauty of the world around us. In this way, the window serves not only as a portal to the outside, but also as a symbol of the ever-changing nature of our experiences and perceptions. The soft glow of the lamp in the room, casting shadows on the walls, serves as a counterpoint to the vibrant colors of the outside world, highlighting the duality of light and darkness that is inherent in our lives. As the sun sets, casting a warm orange glow over the room, we are reminded of the cyclical nature of time, and the way in which the world around us is constantly evolving and changing.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;‘Night is my favourite time and this house comes alive after dark,’ he says. He dislikes the uniform glow produced by downlighters and prefers to accentuate the interplay of illumination and shadow by using a combination of light sources to create a theatrical effect. ‘A lamp placed in the corner of a dark room will produce a pool of light, which is far more atmospheric.&quot;[*Reclaim Magzine* 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;We all know of the numerous verses about light and darkness in the Koran, especially the famous &quot;light verse&quot; (XXIV, 35), that lend themselves to philosophic interpretations: light as the physical manifestation of intellectual or supra-intellectual light, and the different parts of creation as an orderly mixture of light and darkness, an analogy of being and not being, that terminates in God as pure or unmixed light.&quot;[(Editor), Jonathan G. Katz *Architecture as Symbol and Self-Identity*. Aga Khan Award for Architecture, 1980.]</li>

PAGE 20 Window as place The window has the ability to affirm itself as a  place, the key destination in a room, claiming  a vast territory; it can also retreat into anonymity. In Edwardian England, the bay window at  Lyme Hall (1720), swollen and celebrated as a  room-within-a-room, becomes an exalted area  of leisure, expression of privilege, and vantage  point for looking wistfully out. . . &quot;[INPUT: window.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;In these buildings the window performs a function in excess of pictorial visuality. While both window types still prioritize seeing from inside to outside, these examples 56 c h a p t e r 3 3. 9 Gerrit Rietveld, Schroeder house, Utrecht, 1924. window/wall 57 delay the immediate appearance of the “natural” landscape, which was at the heart of the puriﬁed and “hygienic” terrains of Le Corbusier’s urbanism.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;The room was very dark, with little natural light other than through the keyhole shaped gun hole. As mentioned before, I am not a great believer in orbs, but this particular picture stood out to me. Most orbs are simply dust, or an insect reflecting light back from the flash of the camera, however, as can be seen above there is a strong light source behind the orb in this picture, which was the only light source in the room and this part of the room was the only section with any natural light as a result.&quot;[Stewart, G, and G Stewart *Scotland’s Hidden Hauntings: A Collection of Real Ghost Stories*. 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Interior transoms are typically set over doors connecting dark corridors and well-lit perimeter rooms, and take shapes ranging from multi-paned rectangles to arched or semicircular fanlights.

<li>&quot;Consider all of the wonderful uses for fabric at the window: an interlined silk pinch pleat panel hanging stately in a historical home; a simple sheer brushing lazily against a window frame; a dainty gingham checked café curtain decorating a kitchen. Fabric at the window softens edges, emphasizes (or de-emphasizes) architectural qualities and shortcomings and provides a needed barrier between the outside elements and the inner harmony of the home.&quot;[Stoehr, Kathleen S., and Charles T.

<li>&quot;2. Color and Light What colour combinations are the examples of complementary colour scheme?How can different uses of colour change the size of a room?They together may be used in many ways to produce different effects. Dark-colored walls, for example, may absorb the light and make a room dimly lit. However, the same amount of light will appear brighter in a room with pale-colored walls because pale colors reflect light.&quot;[Н.М., Філіппова, and Смуглякова М.К. *Focus on Design. Part Two.

<li>&quot;31 The standard light reflector is used to illuminate the lecture theatre and a system of blackout blinds is added to allow the room to be dimmed for projection. But, even here, Kahn remained committed to the principle of natural light as the begetter of architecture: When a man says that he believes natural light is something we are born out of, he cannot accept a school which has no natural light.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The light source (Figure 3) projects polarized light of intensity Io on the glass. The transmitted light acquires a retardation 8, related to the stress S. 8=txCxS (1) where: fi t C S Retardation related to the Stress Thickness of material Material Constant Stress The method is using white light containing a broad spectrum of wavelength g. For each wavelength 2,. , the transmitted light intensity I becomes: Ii =Iosin2~rfl/~i (2) where: Ii /o 2i Intensity of light measured at ~ wavelengths Source intensity Wavelength The light transmittance Ii/Io becomes a function of stress and of the wavelength L. Using a spectrophotometer, the light intensity Ii is measured at several wavelengths providing a set of simultaneous equations (2) sufficient to retrieve the retardation 8 and compute stress.&quot;[Valerie L.

<li>&quot;Exposure to bright light immediately after awakening is effective for treating delayed sleep phase disorder, as is exposure in the evening for advanced sleep phase disorder and sleep maintenance insomnia (Czeisler et al. , 1988; Lack and Schumacher, 1993; Campbell et al. , 1993). Exposing Alzheimer’s patients to bright light during the day and little light at night, thereby increasing the signal strength for entrainment, has been shown to help to make their rest/activity patterns more stable, bright light being an illuminance of about 1200 lx (van Someren et al. , 1997).&quot;[*The SLL Code for Lighting* London: Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE), 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;(Helson and Lansford, 1970. )• Surfaces with &#x27;warm&#x27; colours are judged as being more pleasant to look at under &#x27;warm-coloured&#x27; light than under &#x27;cool&#x27; light. Conversely, the lack of short-wave energy in warm light tends more or less to &#x27;kill&#x27; cool surface colours. • The best all-round light sources, so far as the judgement of a range of object colours is concerned, are those having a colour appearance between cool and warm.&quot;[de Boer, Prof. J. B., and Prof.Dr. D. Fischer (auth.) *Interior Lighting*. Macmillan Education UK, 1978.]</li>
<li>&quot;SMALL CHANGES WITH LIFE-CHANGING RESULTS Expose Windows Dramatically scaling back window coverings—curtains, drapes, blinds, and valances—lets you use natural light to its full advantage, and, as we’ll say over and over again: Bringing natural light into a space is the easiest, least expensive way to make it over. This not only creates a sense of spaciousness, but also flatters your interiors and alters your mood for the better.&quot;[Mitnik-Miller, Serena, and Mason St. Peter *Abode: Thoughtful Living with Less*. 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;Just as a chandelier in a dining room centers the space over the table, a center light enhances a feeling of coming together and of focus in a room meant for conferences. Successful lighting in a more supporting or secondary role is usually evaluated for efficient illumination, matching light levels to speciﬁc activities, limiting glare from direct sunlight with shading devices, and providing electronic controls that reduce waste.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;It’s the same with window treatments. A room’s figure or shape and its other attributes (function, light exposure, theme of the room, etc) as well as the window itself will help define your decorating style.

<li>&quot;These panels are hung across the lower portion of a window, leaving the top portion open for light. Traditionally, there is a single panel per window section. However, today a more contemporary use includes a set of several panels per window section. This style is often found in kitchens that invoke a country motif or in nurseries. They allow the perfect amount of light into a room.&quot;[M.K., Makridakis, and Holland M. *How to Create Rooms of Radiance. Windows Treatments Made Simple*. 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;However the distribution of light is also important. Even if the average daylight factor is high, parts of the room may look gloomy if they cannot receive direct light or the room is too deep. Section 2. 1. 2 explains how to plot the no-sky line, giving the areas of the room that cannot receive direct skylight. It also provides a formula to calculate whether a room is too deep for satisfactorily uniform daylighting.&quot;[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*.

<li>&quot;Decorative elements and objets are a great way to express your personality, and light adds an extra dimension. This lizard-shaped metal and crystal wall light, Lézard Électrique by Mathieu Lustrerie, has pride of place on a shelf, bringing a quirky and humorous twist to a living space. Multifaceted crystal sparkles like nothing else when light shines through it or reflects off its surface.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Light that’s too bright just dazzles and drains, and a dim, dark room is depressing. There are three different types of lighting: Renno Planner pages 23/6/05 2:13 PM Page 112 112—planning your perfect home renovation ■ Atmospheric—Ambient or atmospheric refers to a room’s overall lighting and the mood it creates. Living spaces and bedrooms feel more comfortable with soft light that fills the entire room.&quot;[May, Alex *Planning Your Perfect Home Renovation: Save time and money with this essential guide to fuss-free home improvements*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Assessing the levels of natural light in an interior is the first step to designing your lighting. The different views shown here (above and below) of the fabulous, dark lacquer, pivoting-panel doors in my home illustrate how much impact the choice of materials has on light. I designed these innovative floor-to-ceiling doors to divide my television room from my open-plan dining space, and whatever angle they are moved to, their shiny surfaces bounce light around and reflect ever-changing views of the room.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;A canopy projecting from the window head outwards has the converse effect from an external obstruction: it reduces the sky component near to the window but does not reduce the penetration. A canopy can, therefore, help to reduce the rapid fall off in daylight factor from front to back of a room. A bay window is a form of canopy. Tall, narrow windows admit more light than low, wide windows of the same area.&quot;[(Auth.), W. R. Stevens *Building Physics: Lighting. Seeing in the Artificial Environment*.
