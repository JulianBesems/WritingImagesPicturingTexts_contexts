However as mentioned the other direction from imagery to text will be explored in one of the experimental sub-chapters in chapter 4, although this will be done partially outside of the text editor. Therefore we will first present the active mediations that are implemented within the WIPT editor, and at the end of this chapter we will briefly showcase the nature of the inverse direction.", "suggested_query": "The interactive negotiation between domains within the WIPT editor is facilitated by a set of active mediations that orchestrate the flow of information and the exchange of meanings between text, image, and other multimedia elements. These mediations are designed to be transparent and flexible, allowing users to dynamically adjust their writing process and experiment with different representations of their ideas. By exploring the various ways in which the WIPT editor supports this interplay between domains, we can better understand the role of interactivity in the creative writing process and its potential to enhance the author's expressiveness and the reader's engagement.", "suggest_context": "3.6 INTERACTIVITY Now that we've established the elements and projections we will rely on within the WIPT editor this chapter introduces the negotiations between all different domains that are foregrounded in the interaction with the multi-modal cast across all domains. Given the simple condition that a text editor is bound by text, and that a thesis which is the testing ground for this multi-modal cast is primarily expected within this domain as well, the primary focus of the interaction is mediated by the writing I am presenting here.
