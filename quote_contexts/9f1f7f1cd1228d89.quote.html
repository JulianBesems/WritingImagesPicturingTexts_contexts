    <pre>One night when I went out to drink water from the garden tap, I heard a long-haul truck barreling along a distant freeway, and another time, as steam rose around my dishwater, I felt the floor rumble with a passing train. The total whiteness is an effacement, an obliterationa neutral element, like a road leading to a place of rest. It is as if one were in a cavern, hidden away, a place where one rediscovers ones origins and roots. They evoke the idea of a place beyond, a place to which one might aspire. They draw one towards a place that, ultimately, one is perhaps not allowed to enter.

<em>The whiteness is a threshold, a boundary beyond which one cannot proceed, though one may feel an irresistible urge to cross it. It is as if one were standing at the edge of a great precipice, the void stretching out before one like an abyss. The whiteness is a silence that swallows all sound, a stillness that freezes all movement.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;The total whiteness is an effacement, an obliteration—a neutral element, like a road leading to a place of rest. It is as if one were in a cavern, hidden away, a place where one rediscovers one’s origins and roots.&quot;[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*.

<li>&quot;The name of the gateway is written above it: “Moment”. ’ Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 1883. trans.

<li>&quot;. . If one can find stillness in the midst of the city turmoil, why should one then forego such an easily accessible spot and seek a more distant one?10 A typical Chinese gentleman kept at least some portion of his walled-in garden as wilderness and while he went into the streets as a civil servant by day, at night he returned to become a mountain recluse.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>

<li>&quot;Only in a hut of one’s own can a person follow his or her own desires—a rigorous discipline, and one that the poet Gary Snyder calls the hardest of all, presupposing as it does self-knowledge while balancing free action and cultural taboo, knowing whether a desire is instinctive or the imprint of culture, or if personal, whether such desires are the product of thought, of contemplation, or of the unconscious. 18 Even if this hut is only one’s normal abode inhabited in a different way, here in a hut of one’s own, a person may find one’s very own self, the source of humanity’s song.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>

<li>&quot;The years 1900 to 1920 define the period when &quot;pure&quot;-or originalBungalow designs held sway. Built before and during the First World War, these houses can be called &quot;Prewar Bungalows. &quot;&quot;[Labau, Peter *The New Bungalow Kitchen*. Taunton Press, 2007.]</li>

<li>&quot;Its three-hour depiction of Nikki Grace’s struggles is organized around spatial concepts that again call to mind Bachelard: “If one were to give an account of all the doors one has closed and opened, of all the doors one would like to re-open, one would have to tell the story of one’s entire life. ”4 Inland Empire, then, is the Lynch ﬁlm with the most to teach us about cinematic architecture.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*.
