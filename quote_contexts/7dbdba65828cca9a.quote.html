    <pre>A drawing representing a horizontal section taken above a floor to show, diagrammatically, the enclosing walls of a building, its doors and windows, and the arrangement of its interior spaces. FLOOR Infinitely harmless, the floor Is obliged to offer Its occupants stability - yet receives from Its users systematic harshness, If not abuse, in return. Homogeneous space is in no way a smooth space; on the contrary, it is the form of striated space. The space of pillars. It is striated by the fall of bodies, the verticals of gravity, the distribution of matter into parallel layers, the lamellar and laminar movement of flows. . . the flow of space was held and horizontal planes within clamp-like walls at each end of the podium. Between these walls the building &#x27;happened&#x27; like a slow dance on a stage. In an exterior way at first, by the very &quot;form&quot; of the text: &quot;curse words&quot; are used in the first sentence, as though to provoke the reader. At first you think it can&#x27;t go on, and then it does.

<em>the slow dance unfolding on the stage of the podium, as if the building were a  performative entity, its movements choreographed by the constraints of gravity and the users&#x27; actions. The striated space, with its pillars and horizontal planes, was both the backdrop and the protagonist of this dance. As the building &#x27;happened&#x27;, it was also constantly being rewritten by the forces that shaped it, the flows that traversed it, and the matter that filled it.  .  .  .</em></pre>

    <div class="selected">In A Thousand Plateaus this whole problem is discussed under the rubric smooth and striated spaces. A smooth space is a nonmetric intensive space, ‘one of distances, not of measures’, whereas a striated space is an extensive space, with a closed, parcelled out or measured surface (Deleuze 1987: 479).[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]</div>

      <li>&quot;Ifwe bring to bear sorne complexity theory terms, we can say that a full statement of &#x27;geophilosophy&#x27; would be that aIl bodies on the strata occupying a striated space arise through the congealing or cooling of an intensive process forming a smooth space and subtended by the singularities inhabiting the virtual plane of consistency (&#x27;phase space&#x27; or &#x27;state space&#x27;).&quot;[Bonta, Mark, and John Protevi *Deleuze and Geophilosophy: A Guide and Glossary (Deleuze Connections)*.

<li>&quot;(SD 15; 176). Second, it is important to note that GT unfolds within and out of a metaphysical space, especially in the first chapter. Specifically it must be remembered that “performativity,” in its first appearance, is designated explicitly as a metaphysical concept (GT 33).&quot;[(Editor), Roland Faber, Michael Halewood (Editor), Deena Lin (Editor), Jeffrey A.

<li>&quot;To think means to be embedded in the present-time stratum that serves as a limit. [F 98, 119] - E. B. Y. Striated space 1. Space designed for a sedentary lifestyle, where movement concerns the relationship between points or nodes which are imported onto it from a higher plane or another dimension; the dimensional movement of territorialized milieus, in distinction from directional movement within lines of flight or smooth space.&quot;[Young, Eugene B., Gary Genosko, and Janell Watson *The Deleuze and Guattari Dictionary*.

<li>&quot;In A Thousand Plateaus this whole problem is discussed under the rubric smooth and striated spaces. A smooth space is a nonmetric intensive space, ‘one of distances, not of measures’, whereas a striated space is an extensive space, with a closed, parcelled out or measured surface (Deleuze 1987: 479).&quot;[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;See Figure 2. STRIATED SPACE [espace strié]: space marked by striae (striations); metric or measured space. Just as smooth space is the product of intensification, striated space is the product of stratification, especiallyas effectuated by the State apparatus (385; 441).&quot;[Bonta, Mark, and John Protevi *Deleuze and Geophilosophy: A Guide and Glossary (Deleuze Connections)*. Edinburgh University Press, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;They 66 Todd Jerome Satter elaborate: ‘In contrast to the sea, the city is the striated space par excellence; the sea is a smooth space fundamentally open to striation, and the city is the force of striation that reimparts smooth space, puts it back into operation everywhere, on earth and in the other elements, outside but also inside itself’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 481).&quot;[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Striated space is given a function, which is imparted on a subject, while smooth space allows subjects to distribute themselves within and throughout space to form a new assemblage (human-building-environment).&quot;[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]</li>

<li>&quot;Instead, it is a matter of reinserting the play of smooth space into the inevitable ‘continuum’ of smooth and striated space.&quot;[Massumi, Brian *A Shock to Thought: Expressions After Deleuze and Guattari (Philosophy &amp; Cultural Studies)*. 2002.]</li>
