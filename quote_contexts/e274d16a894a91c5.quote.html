    <pre>Such stairs could be used as a way of asserting the separation between the gods and mortal men. They could, however, also be used in some instances as a method of human sacrifice, the victim pushed from the top providing a grisly reminder that stairs are as potentially deadly as they are useful. Stairs still hold cultural references. In films, characters attending parties usually arrive descending a set of stairs.A deadbolt turned, foot-steps faded; silence fell.

<em>The air was heavy with the scent of lavender and the faintest hint of smoke, as if the very fabric of reality was beginning to unravel. The darkness seemed to writhe and twist around the edges of perception, as if something was waiting just beyond the veil of consciousness. And then, the sound of footsteps echoed through the silence, growing louder and more insistent with each passing moment.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Waking from dreams of long unending tunnels, of the search for an opening that never appeared, tearing at stones with bare hands, lying prone in the clammy earth amidst worms and maggots, queer thoughts came univited. Waking from a nightmare race, thrashing the blankets, cursing, sweating and gasping for breath, fleeing for life, always his uphill, with the Jerries dose behind; hearing their shouts merge into the crescendoes of the proselytising preacher in the echoing courtyard, then melt away into silence; no I not peaceful silence, but another sound, travelling upwards through the windows, along the searchlight beams, the pad pad pad of the enemy a sentry on his beat; at such a time a time men wondered if they were sane.&quot;[Reid, P R *Escape from Colditz : the two classic escape stories*.

<li>&quot;In the velvet blackness came two white eyes, milky, opalescent, small, farawayawful eyes, like a dead dream. More beautiful than I can describe, the flakes of white flame moving from the perimeter inward, disappearing in the center, like a never-ending flow of opal water into a circular tunnel . . . the eyes of the unknown Horror swelled and expanded until they were close before me. . . .&quot;[Shand-Tucci, Douglass, and Ralph Adams Cram *Boston Bohemia, 1881-1900: Ralph Adams Cram--Life and Architecture*.

<li>&quot;With regard to the door itself, Pallasmaa’s description introduces senses other than that of smell: the sense of touch – ‘the patina of its wood’ – and that of effort – ‘the resistance of its weight’. It also implies a sense of moving into warmth. In The Big Sleep (1939), Raymond Chandler vividly reminds us what it is like to go into a warm and humid greenhouse: ‘We went out at the French doors and along a smooth red-flagged path that skirted the far side of the lawn from the garage….&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*.

<li>&quot;It had grown absolutely dark; a bat fluttered against the broken glass of the window He heard music; far, curious music . . . very faint, very vague, but unmistakable. Like a flash of lightning came a jagged line of fire down the blank wall opposite him, a line that remained, that grew wider, that let a pale cold light into the room, showing him now all its details . . . and in the very middle, black against the curious Page 66 brightness [there stood Count Albert, the] ghost, or devil . . . [who] beckoned to him. . . .&quot;[Shand-Tucci, Douglass, and Ralph Adams Cram *Boston Bohemia, 1881-1900: Ralph Adams Cram--Life and Architecture*. University of Massachusetts Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;Whatever self-consciousness I may have felt at allowing my gut to unwrench in the presence of another human being disappeared as my companion wrestled through a complicated labor to birth to his own unwanted offspring. Something truly epic was taking place next door. Primordial sounds, much like the earth made while cooling, rumbled through already thick, fetid air.&quot;[Praeger, Dave, and Paul Provenza *Poop Culture: How America Is Shaped by Its Grossest National Product*. Feral House, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Foot steps echoed and the German words of command seemed distorted out of reality. I had reached the stage of com mending my soul to the Almighty when the faces behind the bars suddenly took on life; eyes shone, teeth flashed from behind unkempt beards and words passed backwards into the inner depths: none the less so &amp;quot;Anglicy!Anglicy!&amp;quot; Heads crowded each other out behind tiny barred win dows, and in less time than it took us to walk thirty yards there was a cheering mob at every window; not only at the small ones which we had first seen and which we were to come to know so well, but from every other window that we could see there were jostling heads, laughing and cheer breathed ing.&quot;[Reid, P R *Escape from Colditz : the two classic escape stories*.

<li>&quot;Empty words, hollow words, like wind pipes. Just statements through which to blow noise so that there isn’t silence. Be brave. I’d like to say that I am, but I know the truth. If I was brave I would’ve killed him. But instead I left. Mum and Eleanor stood on the steps crying and hugging. My father didn’t come outside when my mate’s truck pulled up to take me into town.&quot;[Newton, Nerida *Death of a Whaler*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;During the day, the light would glare in through the doorway, a reminder of the outside world of exploration and adventure. At night that same doorway would be a portal to the dark world of ghosts or, from outside, a lantern leading back to security of the fire. Before there were windows – in iron-age conical houses for example – crossing a threshold was a passage into darkness.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;By now the air is dark, coldabout minus 15 with the windchilland thick with cloud. We&#x27;re losing heat and using up energy, and we&#x27;re right back where we started. Ian says firmly, &quot;Wait here!I&#x27;m gonna look again for that hut. &quot;He skis off into the cloud. Dan says, &quot;Wait here!I&#x27;m gonna climb that hill and try to find another way out. &quot;Effin and I wait. We feel very much alone in a cold, dark, and entirely unfamiliar place.&quot;[Older, Jules *Cross-Country Skiing for Everyone*. Stackpole Books, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;For Graves, the window, too, is an element that provides a clear division between inside and out. His photograph of a window at the American Academy, Window with Shutters (page 84), is activated by two shutters, mounted to a stone frame, that are neither entirely open nor closed. The window relates to the scale of the human figure, manipulates the quality of light, and possesses a timeless quality, one described by its aging materials and the ivy that surrounds it.&quot;[(auth.), Brian M. Ambroziak *Michael Graves: Images of a Grand Tour*. Princeton Archit.Press, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Yet now Olgivanna wouldn’t speak to either of them. On the day of their departure, “nobody said goodbye to us, nothing. ” Iovanna warned Lath that he and his new love were stepping down into a “mediocre world. ” Indeed, moving out into workaday Arizona, with its unstoppable suburban expansion, was disorienting to them both. “It’s very tough,” Lath recalled, “when you come back [into the world] and nothing seems to be as beautiful, or nicely done.&quot;[Friedland, Roger, and Harold Zellman *Fellowship, The: The Untold Story of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship*.

<li>&quot;‘I’ll meet you down there. ’ Flinch, standing alone, stares fixated at the door. Understands what the lighthouse keeper was trying to point out. Not the staircase, or the brilliance of the lighthouse bulb, or the exposure and freedom of the view from the top, but this message etched so delicately in glass. And Flinch, since childhood cast adrift, sailing towards his destiny on a turbulent sea of emotion, realises the truth.&quot;[Newton, Nerida *Death of a Whaler*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;I still had misgivings, but I finally agreed. The check arrived, and I began delving into the subject at hand: black magic, Ouija boards, devil worship, and the like. I found it uncomfortable at first, but as I got more familiar with the trappings, I began to lose my apprehension. I actually began to enjoy my research into the occult. I now feel that I had put myself in peril by unknowingly opening up a &quot;channel&quot; into the dark side.&quot;[Sellier, Marie *The Paranormal Sourcebook (Roxbury Park Books)*. McGraw-Hill, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;. . CREDENCE’S AUNT pulls off her life jacket so she can dive too . . . She does not reemerge. We close in through the surface of the water, past the drowning woman, and see the dark shape of a drowning baby trailing bubbles of magical light as he sinks . . . and his figure becomes . . . SCENE 110 INT. LESTRANGE MAUSOLEUM—NIGHT . . . the drowning baby falling through sea-green light, hanging in the air in the mausoleum.&quot;[[Rowling, J. K. Rowling, and J.

<li>&quot;SPIELMAN climbs into the carriage. AUROR 1 driving, AUROR 2 beside him. The door closes. A series of padlocks emerges from the carriage doors. An ominous drumroll of clicks as padlocks fasten themselves in place. AUROR 1 Yah!The Thestrals take off. The carriage plummets, then soars away through torrential rain. More AURORS follow on broomsticks. A beat. ABERNATHY steps forward, holding the Elder Wand.&quot;[[Rowling, J. K. Rowling, and J.

<li>&quot;In the meantime, the fire conditions were quickly worsening throughout the building as well as around the hole. The heat coming from the hole was becoming more intense, and Nance was running out of air, as several firefighters heard him say, “I need air. ” While the hole was being opened up and the ladder was being positioned back into the hole, an air bottle was lowered into the basement.&quot;[Kolomay, Richard, and Robert Hoff *Firefighter Rescue And Survival*. Tulsa, Okla: PennWell, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;During light density conditions, Hoskins (2011) found that occupants tended to stay to the inside of the stair. One study (Peacock et al. 2011) used a multiple regression model and found that which side of the stair occupants were on was significant in determining their movement speed. One author attempted to quantify the line-of-travel distance between occupants.&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A. Milke (auth.) *Study of Movement Speeds Down Stairs*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;By day, this comfortable Zen-like bedroom is bright and airy, with a soothing combination of cream and taupe fabrics and carpet bathed in the soft light filtering through the wall of dark wood shutters behind the bed. At night, with the shutters closed and the festoon blinds lowered, the mood changes entirely and the lighting comes into its own, highlighting the qualities of the different textures at play.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;The device provides for a narrow channel that is actually an air space that makes it possible for light from either the back of the skull or underneath to flow through these arches. At their end is a hollow depression that acts as a lens and scatters light into the sockets. Light from the rear of the skull will therefore show the same as light from underneath.&quot;[Sellier, Marie *The Paranormal Sourcebook (Roxbury Park Books)*. McGraw-Hill, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;. . and the edge of the stage. Instead of yelling “Stop!” Gurdjieff calmly turned his back and lit a cigarette as the dancers hurtled through the air into the orchestra pit in a fearful crash, leaving a pile of human forms strewn about in front of the stage. Only then did he yell “Stop!” freezing them where they lay, silent in collapse. When Gurdjieff gave them permission to rise—and it was clear that no one had broken anything—the audience broke into resounding applause.&quot;[Friedland, Roger, and Harold Zellman *Fellowship, The: The Untold Story of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship*. Harper Perennial, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Russian inventor Michael Karnicki suggested a coffin with a glass panel in the lid, which was also sprung so that it could be opened from the inside. If the buried person awoke, he or she would see light coming through the glass window and be able to spring the lid open. The patent anticipated the problem of revival in the hours of darkness when no light might come through the window, but added: ‘If the awakening of the sick person takes place at night, it is inevitably necessary to wait for some hours, but with the beginning of day, service at the church-altar will afford a certain chance of speedy aid. ’ American George Field had a much simpler idea: simply make the coffin of glass so that those outside could see in if all was not well.&quot;[Wade, John *The Ingenious Victorians: Weird and Wonderful Ideas from the Age of Innovation*. Pen &amp; Sword History, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;When it strikes the reflective surface of the mirror, most of it is reflected back as light, which can pass back out the window. When it strikes the dark cat, most of it is changed into heat energy, which does not pass back through the glass nearly so readily as light. which is almost always done by high-tech, high-pressure, and high-priced companies.&quot;[Freeman, Mark *The Solar Home: How to Design and Build a House You Heat With the Sun (How-To Guides)*.

<li>&quot;Also, counterflow was present in the stair with only the photoluminescent markings. Density was calculated for the average conditions in each stair during the busiest 3 min of the drill. The densities were 2. 05 persons/m2 (photoluminescent markings stair), 1. 00 persons/m2 (reduced emergency lighting and photoluminescent markings stair), 1. 23 persons/m2 (reduced emergency lighting stair), and 1. 30 persons/m2 (normal emergency lighting stair).&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A.

<li>&quot;Urgent or emergency radio transmission. Situations that require this type of communication call for radio silence and for firefighters in the immediate area of the problem to handle it. Note the following situations that fall into this category. 1. Minor SCBA air leak 2. Minor entanglement 3. Firefighters exiting building on SCBA low-air alarms 4. Investigation of an activated PASS alarm 5.&quot;[Kolomay, Richard, and Robert Hoff *Firefighter Rescue And Survival*. Tulsa, Okla: PennWell, 2003.]</li>
