    <pre>Let&#x27;s start with a definition on the ornament:

<em>An ornament is a decorative object, often made of glass, metal, or ceramic, designed to be hung or placed on a Christmas tree, mantel, or other festive location. Its primary purpose is to add visual appeal and festive cheer to the holiday season. With its intricate designs and sparkling colors, an ornament can become a treasured family heirloom or a cherished keepsake.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;One means of transporting fire was to enclose smouldering bracket fungus or punk wood in a clamshell or sometimes in folded cedar bark. A woman&#x27;s labret, usually made of stone or wood, was occasionally of bark. The Kwakiutl made a ball, used in a batting game, by tightly rolling skunk cabbage leaves into a small sphere and wrapping it with a strip of cedar bark. Artists used templates made from hide or more often from inner cedar bark, cut and folded in half to be sure both sides were alike. Each represented some main element of the design; by drawing around the template on one side of the design, then using it for the other side, exactness and symmetry were assured.&quot;[Stewart, Hilary *Cedar : Tree of Life to the Northwest Coast Indians.*. Vancouver ; Seattle: Douglas &amp; McIntyre ; University of Washington Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;A type of lace made from metal or metallic threads, such as gold, silver, or copper. The designs were worked directly on a textile ground, or the lace was completely made from metallic threads. Metallic lace was used as an embellishment in all manner of clothing, from shoes to waistcoats, gowns, and caps. Usually goatskin that was tanned with sumac, meant to imitate leather from Morocco. It was frequently dyed red. A shoe without heel quarters. A patten includes various types of footwear with a thick sole, usually made of leather, that is used to elevate the foot from mud and muck in streets and roads, protecting the shoes.&quot;[Alexander, Kimberly S. *Treasures Underfoot: The History of Shoes in Early America*.

<li>&quot;Its shape, size and the richness and quality of the decoration depend on the period when it was made. Chests may be made of wood or completely covered in painted fabric or leather. In the case of wooden chests, the boards of which the chest was made were held together by strap hinges and flat metal bands and decorated with iron corner pieces and legs. Their lids are flat and hinged and they were locked using a padlock. If the chest was upholstered with fabric or leather, it was decorated with a great many studs arranged in repeating patterns and, here and there a copper or tin rosette decorated with perforations.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*.

<li>&quot;This material’s special properties — governed by the proportions of the mixture, by the addition of other materials, by still unexplained natural effects, by  special treatment and preparation of the paste, and by other circumstances —  impart a specific character to the principal features of the ceramic style. The general properties of the alum compounds to be considered first are  their plasticity or malleability. All artistic products made from them are therefore o f the type originally made from  a soft paste. As the most general family  feature, this applies even to ceramic works made not from a soft paste but  from solid materials such as stone, metal, wood, and so on. The primeval  material of the technique to which they belong, based on their intended use,  retains its ancient claim, although this does not mean that the claim of the  material of which they are actually made may be denied. &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The backboard for the cradle is missing. The two quilled ornaments, wrapped around the cradle, are made of smoked skin adorned with orange, white, red, brown, light blue, and yellow porcupine quills. Two ornamental straps are decorated with quill-wrapped thongs, tin cones, and blue and white pony beads. The cradleboard in PEM beautifully illustrates Dakota quillwork. Karen Kramer, a curator at the museum, noted the significance of the materials and design: “Given the quantity of metal cones used on this carrier, the tremendous feat involved in processing the thousands of porcupine quills, and the weaving of such an elaborate and meaningful design, it is likely that it was made for a family of very high rank. ” The tumpline and the tinklers depict the spirit being known as the thunderbird.&quot;[Broughton, Deanna Tidwell *Hide, Wood, and Willow: Cradles of the Great Plains Indians*.

<li>&quot;In the 19th century, goods and passengers were transported in wagons and carriages made of wood, fitted with wheels made of wood. Wood was used as packaging (in the creation of wood packaging the Shakers excelled) to store foodstuffs, seeds, clothing and other household goods. The ubiquitous Shaker oval box is a storage concept designed for such applications. Shoemakers sewed shoes on wooden forms.&quot;[Pierce, Kerry *Pleasant Hill Shaker Furniture*. Popular Woodworking Books, 2007.]</li>

Bloomsbury, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The rigid profiles of time-honoured mouldings balance the panels. The boudoir – the last vestige of the Louis XV era – was draped in light fabrics with narrow stripes or discreet foliage patterns. The fireplace was small and made from white marble. The mantle, supported by caryatids, displayed oak and laurel leaves, collages, pearls, heart-and-darts, and ribbons. Decorations, as well as firedogs and screens, were most often made of copper. Wood, if not discreetly gilded, was lacquered in grey, producing a cool, proper, monotone effect.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*. Parkstone International, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Embroidery Most common form of Victorian fancy needlework. Generally described as embellishing a foundation fabric with stitches to produce a decorative design. Embroidery Frame Device to stretch fabric for easier stitching. A tambour frame is round or oval and clamps the fabric between a larger and a smaller hoop. Larger frames are usually square and mount the canvas by strapping it onto stands convenient to work from a chair. Emery Ground particles of an extremely hard mineral called corundum.&quot;[Ledbetter, Kathryn *Victorian needlework*. Santa Barbara, Calif., Great Britain: ABC CLIO;Praeger, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;A newly made cradle would be smoked with cedar and sage and then blessed. If a baby died, the cradle would be placed in the grave. 3 The cover was made of a rectangular piece of hide and usually completely beaded; beads were attached with sinew and laced to the framework, starting just above the top crosspiece. Covers were made of two pieces, beaded separately and put together when the beading was complete. Later, the beaded hide covers were replaced with canvas and red wool; steel needles and thread replaced sinew and awls; pieces of linoleum replaced rawhide backs; and soft buckskin linings replaced the cloth.&quot;[Broughton, Deanna Tidwell *Hide, Wood, and Willow: Cradles of the Great Plains Indians*.

Santa Barbara, Calif., Great Britain: ABC CLIO;Praeger, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Ohr’s methods of surface decoration are also drawn from the folk tradition. He often used sponging, a typical design in which a sponge coated in iron oxide was pressed around the circumference of the body, creating a modest but pleasing pattern. There are instances when Ohr used this motif on traditionally functional forms that were then made nonfunctional, such as pitchers with zigzag handles that are too diﬃcult to grasp and too thin to support vessels. In these instances Ohr creates a jarring juxtaposition of purist utility and visual oddity.&quot;[Ohr, George E., Ellen J. Lippert, and George E Ohr *George Ohr : sophisticate and rube*. United States: University of Minnesota Press;University Press of Mississippi, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;As a result, country furniture makers in Kentucky, and elsewhere, often created a simulated cock beading around drawer fronts. In the case of very large drawer fronts, that cock beading might be created with a side-bead plane (a kind of molding plane), but much more often, the craftsman would use a shop-made tool called a scratch stock. A scratch stock is simply a bit of thin metal fi xed in a wooden holder. The bit of thin metal would be cut with the shape of a bead and quirk (a narrow recessed part of a molding).&quot;[Pierce, Kerry *Pleasant Hill Shaker Furniture*. Popular Woodworking Books, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Wearing a crested button blanket with such a hat, a high-ranking person presented an image of great dignity and wealth. Although generally carved from hardwoods, these were occasionally made of yellow cedar. Similarly, a &quot;frontlet,&quot; the often exquisitely carved plaque at the front of a northern chief&#x27;s dance headdress, was occasionally made of yellow cedar. Generally inlaid with bright blue-green abalone shell, the frontlet was attached to a headband surmounted by walrus whiskers, sometimes with red-shafted flicker feathers adding to the colour.&quot;[Stewart, Hilary *Cedar : Tree of Life to the Northwest Coast Indians.*.

New York: HarperCollins, 1992. ■ ■ ■ Coif W orn by women, men, and children throughout the Middle Ages (c. 500–c. 1500), the coif was a simple fabric cap that covered all or most of the hair and tied under the chin. Coifs could be worn under another hat for extra warmth, but they were frequently worn alone. They were usually made of plain linen or wool, although soldiers often wore a coif made of chain mail (flexible armor made of intertwining metal chains) under their helmets.&quot;[Pendergast, Sara, Tom Pendergast, and Sarah Hermsen *Fashion, costume, and culture: clothing, headwear, body decorations, and footwear through the ages*.

<li>&quot;The tabard retained the basic form of the surcote, and it was worn on top of other clothes, but the resemblance ended there. The tabard was shorter, ending at the waist. It was often trimmed out with fur at the hem and armholes. It was often parti-colored, which meant it had sides made in fabrics of contrasting color.
