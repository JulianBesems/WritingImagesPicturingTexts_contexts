<li>&quot;From Neolithic times onward, in  cultures all around the world, the threshing floor was a place of work but also a place of gathering,  dancing, ritual, and worship. It evolved into the square or plaza -  the meeting ground of the demos. A place of assembly and negotiation, it is then perhaps the first &quot;floor,&quot; as that word is used in  &quot;the floor of the parliament&quot; or &quot;the floor of the stock exchange. &quot;&quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Your teacher or the accompanist provides transitional music to allow groups to move in and out of the dancing space. Move across the floor. When you move across the floor either by yourself, in a line, or with a group, you must be safe and courteous.

<li>&quot;FLOOR PAGE 57 Wickham, she falls to the floor. A tantrum is also ideally performed, kicking and screaming, on the floor.  The floor holds the same entropic thrall over inanimate objects. Failed things, no longer able to resist  gravity, lose their place and become detritus on the floor. Things strewn on the floor are signs of  chaos. The Japanese custom of meticulously maintaining the floor or the Shaker custom of keeping  things up off the floor attempts to deny this failure or loss of control. &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Floor-Ceiling Systems Often, for aesthetic reasons, for foot comfort, for noise control or to protect the deck from wear, afloor covering is placed atop the deck. In such cases, the deck is called a subfloor. When a floor is not placed directly on the ground; for example, when a floor extends above a room below, some means must be provided for supporting the deck in place.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;2. 1. Structure To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. In primitive buildings, the ground may be used as the floor. In better buildings, the floor may be a deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist indicated in Fig.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;From a full-foot position, the working foot peels off the floor to a pointed position. Meanwhile, weight quickly shifts to the supporting leg, the abdominal muscles engage, and the torso pulls up as the body weight centers and aligns over the supporting leg.

<li>&quot;At the waiting area, the wood floor pattern breaks the normal long-running board pattern with cross-stitched short boards slowing the visitor down. In the lounge area a brick floor with a simple running bond pattern define the informal dining area. At the kitchen visitors walk on an antiqued hexagonal brick floor. Even in the bathrooms, a carefully considered large stone floor pattern support a larger series of discrete experiences that work overall to quietly engage the visitor into quiet contemplation.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*.

<li>&quot;In such cases, horizontal structural members, called beams, have to be provided to carry the weight of the deck and the loads on it to the vertical supports. Figure 2. 2 illustrates two of many types of floor construction in use. Figure 2. 2a shows a floor system often used in houses. The plywood sub floor is covered with carpeting. On the underside, the sub floor is supported on Electrical Systems In most buildings, electric equipment and wiring are provided to bring electric power into the interior and distribute the power where needed, for lighting, heating, operating motors, control systems and electronic equipment.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;Exceptions to this would be rooms below ground level where damp could damage the timber, rooms which were likely to be wet due to their function, eg kitchens and sculleries, and some working class terraced housing built with clay block floors or stone flags. NB For more information on timber see Chapter 11- Timber-Frame Housing. The floor (often referred to as a raised timber floor or suspended floor) consists of a series of joists supported by the loadbearing walls and covered with floorboards.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;Access to fire/exit stairs is typically from an internal corridor in a floor-to-floor pattern, as seen in the through-section drawings of this case study (Illustration 9–35). At the first, or ground-floor, level, if floor space is available, a very simple solution is to provide an adjacent corridor directly to the exterior. If additional space is not available, a three-flight/two-mid-landing stair can be created.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
