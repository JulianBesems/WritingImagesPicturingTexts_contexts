    <pre>The PhD thesis presented here revolves around the process of writing itself. Not in the way you might expect where the writing follows it’s argument, and it traces a path throughout the 3 years spent on this research, but rather in a way where after three years the culmination of research is the process of writing this itself. To clarify, we are particularly interested in the writing as a process, in the same way that from an architectural research perspective one might be interested primarily in the process of the designing, not necessarily the outcome itself. But we digress here. The reason from mentioning this in the outset, is that the instrument in which this thesis was written is designed and developed itself, as a response to the journey of engaging with the phd research. So everything that is presented here is at once the presentation of the research within this text and images, as well as a result that provides the material of the research itself because it was written in the instrument it describes. Therefore as the writing was a back and forth process between the author and the instrument, the reader will be asked to engage in this relation as well where the text is both explanation and outcome. It proposes a similar engagement to an architect walking through a building in order to understand it rather than being presented with the plans straight away.</pre>

      <li>&quot;*The End-of-Art Thesis proclaims our liberation from having to find sensuous equivalents for the content of thought. Thinking has risen above and beyond what art is capable of. Art belongs to a less evolved mode of thinking than what the mind, not only ideally but actually, is capable of – and we find this higher capability only in philosophy.* — **This interpretation, although I&#x27;m personally not entirely convinced, offers a compelling argument for the emphasis of the thought process in crafting an architecture, over the use of &#x27;sensuous means&#x27;.** [Danto - HEGEL’S END-OF ART THESIS.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SP8VUVB9?page=3&amp;annotation=N9IL37PK)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The text thus loops, overlaps, and reconnects with itself to stitch a rhizomatic lacework of affinities and relationships across time and disciplines.* — **Could be an interesting inspiration for the phrasing the method of PhD** [AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RFAYGAN3?page=18&amp;annotation=GJGD6CZ6)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The second possibility flows directly from this. If one way of altering the definition of architecture is to insist on the architect&#x27;s direct involvement, either calling the drawing &#x27;art&#x27; or pushing it aside in favour of unmediated construction, the other would be to use the transmissive, commutative properties of the drawing to better effect. This latter option - which I call the unpopular option - I wish to discuss in this article.* [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=6&amp;annotation=A5ILQVRK)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The resulting displacement of effort and indirectness of acce~smll seem t_ome to be distinguishing features of conventional arc_h1te~ture cons1dere~as a visual art, but whether always and necessarily d1sa_dvantageous 1s another question.* [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=5&amp;annotation=S9ANLS7C)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*I would like to suggestthat something similar occurs in architecture between the drawing and the building, and that a similar suspension of critical disbelief is necessary in order to enable architects to perform their task at all.* [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=4&amp;annotation=4GNE7ILN)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*What interests us is the inversion from—putting it succinctly—the “mastership in creating objects” (5th c. ) to “objects presenting mastership” (3rd c. ). In the 5th c. , “mastership” is necessary and objects are contingent, whereas in the 3rd c. , “good objects” are necessary and mastership is contingent, which we would symbolize as: (C)N vs. (N)C.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt &amp; Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=24&amp;annotation=SME2ISPC)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*ransitioning from content stability and regression to progress, and from closed diagrams to open diagrams.* — **usefull for PhD? the idea of the model as pure geometry and as such a closed diagram, having to open this up through movement and facilitating the synthesis of open diagrams?** [LeibnizPart1_SummaryGPT.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5M4VIKQE?page=13&amp;annotation=NJ8RGGQ4)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*fostering a more systematic comprehension of architectural design processes.* [Calixto and Croffi - BACK TO BLACK BOXES.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5K4B2MNK?page=40&amp;annotation=YRQ8CV96)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The two options, one emphasizing the corporeal properties of things made, the other concentrating on the disembodied properties in the drawing, are diametrically opposed: in the one corner, involvement, substantiality, tangibility, presence, immediacy, direct action; in the other, disengagement, obliqueness, abstraction, mediation and action at a distance.* — **Interesting as an argument for the approach that has been taken to the role of the computational in representing architecture. This has been primarily been through that of the first &quot;popular&#x27; option. Thus the challenges of the second have been neglected in this form/technics of communication.** [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=6&amp;annotation=Q6KQN5ZC)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*he PCA and the eigenvectors were the topic that most fascinated last year’s students. So we named this book, reporting their research, EigenArchitecture: thinking of architecture as self-fictitious things of rational talks.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt &amp; Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=56&amp;annotation=TQX3MEH9)&quot;</li>
