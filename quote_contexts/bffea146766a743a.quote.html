      <li>&quot;Today, architecture is being reduced to the practice of “building images. ”60 In a society saturated by images, the aesthetic practice of architecture has increasingly become “photogenic. ” Against this, it should rather become “photographic,” in the sense I elaborated above. From the misguided idea of architecture as “Sign” in its different variations in the 1970s, the discourse of building has merely moved towards another version as “ image-making,” or “hyperbuilding,” conceived as a form of “media. ” The resulting anaestheticization is the consequence of a failure to “reimagine the aesthetic” of building within the paradigm of the new technology.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*.

<li>&quot;Conversely, architecture as a discipline focuses on the permanence of the architectural object and the myth of its perfectability. DeLanda’s synthetic understanding of cities is inherently destabilizing to architecture because it elevates material factors to the same level as cultural production. The current fascination with fluidity may serve as a catalyst toward a new understanding of architectural processes. However, the preoccupation with representations of fluidity as built form restricts us to rigidly conventional architectural discourse.&quot;[James, Vincent, and Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is here that it is instructive to position the engagement and use of new digital media within architecture as part of these larger cultural transformations; for there is a parallel rise between the use of digital technology within architecture and popular entertainment. During the period that architecture slowly moved to adopt digital means of drawing and modelling these systems were producing ever more ‘realistic’ representations of architectural space within popular game environments.&quot;[Arya, Rina *Francis Bacon: Critical and Theoretical Perspectives*.

<li>&quot;It is not used solely to build an argument or rationalize form but to disturb our process of design and expose unique social, environmental, and cultural issues embedded in the initial constraints of each project. As a design evolves, we renegotiate its conceptual framework through a process that is inherently fluid, adaptive, and self-critical. We use research to undermine many assumptions about architecture as a discipline, such as the fixity of building type, the hierarchy of facade and entry, the rigid nature of program, and the universal and global character that modern architecture has put into place.&quot;[James, Vincent, and Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The need for a change of perspective on spatiality and more dialogue across disciplines should be as important to scholars in architecture as it has been to critics in literary and cultural studies. Diana Fuss’s recent The Sense of Interior stresses the interpenetration of built and literary forms, “To attribute substance and materiality to architecture, and imagination and metaphor to literature, misreads both artistic forms.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;These are the underlying geometrical regulating lines that in painting have served to organize scenographic depth and in architecture to control proportional relationships. Architecture’s close relationship to these drawn geometric practices is exactly what the Bacon-derived Deleuzean concept of the figure has challenged. Deleuze’s description of Bacon’s work as a materially ‘af fective’ field that directly acts on the observer has served to foster a new framework of understanding for the diagrammatic in what otherwise has become an overly conventionalized tool within architecture.&quot;[Arya, Rina *Francis Bacon: Critical and Theoretical Perspectives*. Peter Lang International Academic Publishers, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;It requires perception } of thermal and luminous phenomenon that are not visible in the same sense as architectural space. Boundaries in the thermal or luminous environment are subtle and not sharply defined. 33 Whereas architecture as building emphasizes an iconic image—singularity and static fixity, the metaphors of architecture as organism and architecture as furnishing a larger room suggest a dynamic, open, less formal and more fluid style. By demanding recognition of something beyond the work itself these metaphors critically promote the architectural function as the intertwining of making and world producing the spatial potentiality for the intertwining of (human) organisms and environment.&quot;[(auth.), Gary Backhaus, Gary Backhaus, and John Murungi (eds.) *Symbolic Landscapes*. Springer Netherlands, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Mies’s later work epitomizes the architectonic issues implied in Benjamin’s remarks on the conversion of natural material into building material, and the contrast between historical style and constructive style. At the same time, Mies’s architecture deterritorializes the modernist understanding of architecture; his work has left most contemporary architects with no choice but to return to the ethos of historical eclecticism, or to the tradition of the historical avant-garde, now approached through digital techniques. 41 Second, Benjamin’s assertion that technique determines the formal in art and architecture needs a detailed discussion of the way mediatic techniques transform form in architecture.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;doubleNegatives Architecture consists of Sota Ichikawa, Max Rheiner (Switzerland), Ákos Maróy (Hungary), and Kaoru Kobata (Japan). With the installation Corpora in Si(gh)te (Japan 2007), they have constructed self-organizing systems in interior and exterior space and displayed the process of their development (Plate 26). Therein lies an alternative aesthetic approach towards built environments (architecture) and dominant visual regimes (predominantly linear perspective).&quot;[Ulrik, Ekman, Bolter Jay David, and Díaz Lily (Eds). *Ubiquitous Computing, Complexity and Culture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Missing is an understanding of the fluidity of building processes and the feedback loop that results from seeing architecture as a cyclical and evolving process of making, occupying, and remaking—the ongoing generation of architectural form that is continually informed by social, environmental, and technological factors. In a microcosm, the construction of buildings corresponds directly to the self-governing or culturally contingent behaviors that DeLanda examines on a historical and geographic scale.&quot;[James, Vincent, and Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*.

<li>&quot;In short, can architecture be thought, in connection with other series, as assemblage?What would this entail?What are the implications of opening up architectural discourses to Deleuzian desire-as-production?Can architecture work (its or an) outside?What is it to open up architecture to thought, to force, to life, to the outside?By outside I do not mean the practical, ﬁnancial, and aesthetic exigencies of building design and construction, nor even the demands on architecture to align with the environment, a landscape, interior design, interior or exterior artworks, which in a certain sense are all “inside” architecture and its history, part of the necessary structure of compromise that produces a building as a commodity.&quot;[Grosz, Elizabeth *Architecture from the Outside: Essays on Virtual and Real Space (Writing Architecture)*. 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;1 Bachelard, Poetics of Space, 59. 2 Geertz, Interpretation of Cultures, 210. 3 My observations as to the impact of metaphorical insight in the architectural design process owes much to the work of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, in particular their book Metaphors We Live By in which they offer a systematic framework for clarifying the pervasive influence of metaphors in our thinking. 4 Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors We Live By, 158.

<li>&quot;It is not terribly unexpected that a painter should have such inf luence over the discipline of architecture. Indeed, since the Renaissance, painting and architecture have shared a special relationship amongst the arts. Architecture as a primarily vicarious act has deployed the geometric tools and representational techniques that were rationalized and codified by Renaissance painting to underwrite its own graphical procedures. In turn, architecture has inf luenced painting by providing the framed window as the primary visual metaphor and dominant mode of painterly representation.&quot;[Arya, Rina *Francis Bacon: Critical and Theoretical Perspectives*.
