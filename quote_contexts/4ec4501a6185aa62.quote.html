    <div class="selected">Most of the buildings in the world are structured today by three-dimensional frames, consisting of floor slabs supported by beams, beams supported by columns, columns supported by foundations, and foundations sitting on the earth. The beams and columns, usually set at the corners of a rectangular grid, are made out of steel or reinforced concrete; the floor slabs, most of the time, of reinforced concrete.[Levy, Matthys, Mario Salvadori, and Kevin Woest *Why Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail*.

<li>&quot;floor&quot; to prompt or indulge a spectrum of behaviors is perhaps another underexploited power  worth retrieving from a study of architectural elements. section A historical fast-forward through the changing cross-section of the floor would remain steady on  hardened earth for centuries, eventually incorporating aggregates of stone and wooden timbers.  Floors in ancient palaces and temples across all civilizations, paved with every possible stone and  metal, would animate the section slightly. The Greeks introduced beams combining stone and  iron to resist bending. Romans introduced the chemical composite of concrete also occasionally &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The walls are a large “plane. ” The sofa is a large “plane. ” The floor coverings and floor are large planes. My apartment might be a fun example to analyze . . . Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor. The walls pull from the white in the floor—a quiet “plane” in contrast with the “pop” of the painted floors.&quot;[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy &amp; broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*.

<li>&quot;2. 1. Structure To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. In primitive buildings, the ground may be used as the floor. In better buildings, the floor may be a deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist indicated in Fig.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;The polished, semi-reflective background provided by the grey concrete floor against the light, floating gypsum board ceiling. The translucent glass that lets light pass through, providing functions as a visual space divider and as product display background. The colours and textures also serve as visual references, the wooden boxes, the red modules, the exposed concrete benches identify the different spaces defined and created by and within them.&quot;[Chang, Catherine *Beauty Salons*.

<li>&quot;The primary concern of this text is space planning, not design presentation. Despite this, the language of space planning is the floor plan, and its graphic qualities cannot be entirely ignored. One of the premises of the planning methodology presented here is that the transition from the rough floor plan to the preliminary or presentation floor plan is part of the planning process, not just a graphic refinement.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Floor Finish A concrete floor can be finished with a sand and cement screed. By adding a floating floor it can provide good resistance to impact sound (from footsteps etc). This usually involves separating the floor finish from the structure by a thin layer of resilient material, ie a material that will return to its original size after being compressed.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;At the waiting area, the wood floor pattern breaks the normal long-running board pattern with cross-stitched short boards slowing the visitor down. In the lounge area a brick floor with a simple running bond pattern define the informal dining area. At the kitchen visitors walk on an antiqued hexagonal brick floor. Even in the bathrooms, a carefully considered large stone floor pattern support a larger series of discrete experiences that work overall to quietly engage the visitor into quiet contemplation.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*.

<li>&quot;It is made with two parts of marble chips to one part of portland cement. The finished surface therefore has the appearance of marble particles set in a cement matrix. A terrazzo topping may be cast integral with a concrete floor, bonded to a hardened concrete floor, or seated on a sand cushion, to prevent injury from settlement, expansion, contraction or vibration.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;There are a number of different patterns. The nature and position of the DPM will depend on the type of floor structure and finish. In the drawing below a ground bearing slab sits on a polythene DPM. In the example shown in the photograph the panels are fixed to a sole plate sitting on a pre-cast concrete slab. The floor comprises a series of inverted ‘T’ beams with a lightweight block infill.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;Then, there’s a simple neutral sisal rug on the floor, which adds texture, ties into the color of the beige floor squares, and adds a little calm to the room. Sofa: quiet. Also beigey. Pillows: mixture of quiet and “wow,” drawing from the other patterns, colors, and materials in the room to inform a balance of “wow” on an otherwise neutral piece. This might sound a little milquetoast at first glance, but then POP!&quot;[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy &amp; broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*.

<li>&quot;The guest dining room features the combination of dark and light tiles and stainless steel mosaic on the floor. The silk wall and the wall with blue-and-white porcelain dishes behind the sofa lend the space with the Chinese elegance and luxury. Between the dining room and the subsidiary bathroom, an abstract bamboo partition connects the two spaces.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*. Design Media Publishing Ltd, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Figure 4 shows that the expressions contained in the seismic provisions of the UBC 1997 and ASCE/SEI 7-10 to determine floor accelerations for the design of nonstructural components are representative of the floor acceleration envelope. The term Ai /Ag represents the amplification of the floor acceleration with respect to the peak ground acceleration, and the term hi /hr represents the floor height divided by the roof height.&quot;[Lynn, Abraham C., and Robert Reitherman *AEI 2011 : building integration solutions : proceedings of the 2011 Architectural Engineering National Conference, March 30-April 2, 2011 Oakland, California*.

<li>&quot;In all cases, a successfully tiled floor relies on proper preparation. That starts with laying down a stable, secure surface for the tile (see pages 70 to 75). But the most important step for the look of the finished floor is snapping the chalk lines and dry-fitting to determine the most visually pleasing tile placement.&quot;[Press, Editors of Cool Springs *Black &amp; Decker Complete Guide to Bathrooms 5th Edition : Dazzling Upgrades &amp; Hardworking Improvements You Can Do Yourself*. 5th ed.

<li>&quot;Another example of concealed storage is the grooved timber, lit up to highlight their contours and the bust by Ralph Brown. Assessing a space and planning the layout is something that has always come naturally to me because I find it very easy to visualize a room in three dimensions – a cuboid made up of six vertical and horizontal planes: four walls, a ceiling and a floor.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*.

<li>&quot;A wall of timber veneer slats emphasizes the vertical grid while separating the living area from the marble and bespoke joinery entrance hall behind. The JNL Samara lacquered coffee table also has a cross-shaped stainless-steel runner. This bathroom in one of my previous London homes features a stunning floor of taupe-coloured milk glass, which has a lovely reflective sheen.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*.

<li>&quot;Mapeguard 2 helps prevent existing or future in-plane floor cracks (with movement up to 3/8” [10 mm] wide) from transmitting through grout, ceramic tile or natural stone. It also reduces impact sound (footsteps, dropped objects, etc. )and airborne sound (voice, TV, etc. )transmission through floors when installed under ceramic tile, stone or wood floor coverings.&quot;[Nalbandian, Arpi *Tile Magazine September-October 2011*.

<li>&quot;FIGURE 7. 11 This is a cross section drawing of our basement floor retrofit. Once insulation materials were installed on the sloped concrete floor, I added a level, finished floor above it. Illustration by Matthew Baker. In some situations, very minor water intrusion, either through walls or wicking up through floor slabs, can be handled by installing a layer of drainage mat material as part of a floor and wall retrofit.&quot;[Wilson, Jeff *The Greened House Effect: Renovating Your Home with a Deep Energy Retrofit*. 2nd ed.

<li>&quot;The incorporation of the horizontal loadbearing elements (floor slabs) into the vertical ones (columns) is another distinguishing criterion.&quot;[Herzog, Thomas *Facade Construction Manual*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;5. 4) built in China for different kinds of ritual purposes. 82 The first type has the interior divided by the pillars across both width and depth to form an inner space enclosed by aisles on its four sides; in comparison, the second type, with a square floor plan, is divided into inner and outer spaces.&quot;[Lin, Wei-Cheng *Building a Sacred Mountain: The Buddhist Architecture of China’s Mount Wutai*.

<li>&quot;The second half of the room is oﬀ-limits to all visitors. The floor of this secure space is made of solid gold and was made through visitors donating their old gold jewelry to be melted down by the temple. 22 The gold sheets on the floor are held between two sheets of thin crystal. Placed on this floor is the shrine holding the relic stupa. The entire space holding the stupa and relic cannot be stepped on and is shielded from visitors with bulletproof glass.&quot;[McDaniel, Justin Thomas, and Mark Michael Rowe *Architects of Buddhist Leisure: Socially Disengaged Buddhism in Asia’s Museums, Monuments, and Amusement Parks*.
