Selected: On the hurried, ‘downtown’ terms of ‘Ornament and Crime’ it might seem absurd to think that ornament’s being extra-difficult to execute should make it more art-worthy; but in fact, this is exactly how Maori ornament would serve the more ‘idealist’ argument of Riegl in Stilfragen (Problems of Style; 1893), against the ‘materialist’ view of Gottfried Semper: that this shows the Maori carvers’ spirals as something they really wanted to make, not something that more or less had to come out that way, given the materials, tools, ‘techniques’.[Loos, Adolf *Ornament and Crime*. Penguin Books Ltd, 2019.]

01. "It becomes possible to introduce the potential of variation from a perceived norm into the process. Jongerius loves mixing craft methods with new materials: porcelain vases, finished in spray paint and lacquer; making fabrics that combine felt and wool. Jongerius explores ways to make something new out of the manufacturing process: so shiny, glossy surfaces can be replaced by lesser degrees of polish. Pure geometry is not the only possible formal language. Pure colour can give way to muddy mixes. Symmetry is not the only option."[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*. Rizzoli Ex Libris, 2015.]

Penguin Books Ltd, 2019.]

03. "The apparent amount of labor and technical skill that went into the creation of the object is related to the defined aesthetic value of that object (MukeIji, 1978: 352). If anyone, no matter what their level of ability and experience, can make something in a relatively brief period of time, it is less likely that it will be labeled with the honorific title of art than if the object overtly exhibits skill, knowledge, and a degree of toil."[Sanders, Clinton, and D Angus Vail *Customizing the Body: The Art and Culture of Tattooing*. Revised. Temple University Press, 2008.]

04. "From the perspective of the decorative arts the relationship between maker, user and artist continues to define the essential nature of design. It is the spark that brings skill to life. But although Lorenzo Ghiberti, the goldsmith, sculptor and architect, and rediscoverer of the lost-wax casting process that was used to make the baptistry doors, can also be called a designer, looking at his working methods and ideas does not offer much help in understanding the rather different version of design now practised by Jonathan Ive at Apple, say."[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*. Rizzoli Ex Libris, 2015.]

05. "More broadly conceived, however, aesthetics can inform inquiry into a variety and range of behaviors heretofore neglected or ignored. In its basic denotative meaning, creativity refers to bringing something into being or causing something to exist. Anything produced is thus created. Usually the term connotes doing something well (with skill and mastery of technique). Sometimes, especially when associated with art conceived of as major monuments, creativity is equated with innovation. Problems arise when tradition and innovation, or tradition and creativity, are thought of as opposites."[Jones, Michael Owen *Craftsman of the Cumberlands: Tradition and Creativity*. University Press of Kentucky, 2003.]

06. "They are keepers of cultural memory that hold safe what we know and encourage further inquiry. What is changing is how that cultural memory is accessed. The so-called �Heavenly Library" that exists in the cloud of the internet may make available more works than any single �real" library could hold. The move by Google to scan the collections of the world's great libraries and make them available online remains controversial."[Morgan, Joyce, and Conrad Walters *Journeys on the Silk Road: A Desert Explorer, Buddha's Secret Library, and the Unearthing of the World's Oldest Printed Book*. Lyons Press, 2012.]

07. "Her goal (and Clair Patterson’s too) is to make experimental discoveries into facts of nature rather than artifacts of a single experimental place. Local contingencies are the enemy of the universally true. But Wasylenki’s ultra clean lab is a “local” thing, a bounded place with specific geographic coordinates and with a stringent material order built on-site. Her lab is unavoidably the local and particular provenance of claims seeking to be true everywhere and “as if ” from anywhere. Place achieves placelessness—this is a paradox, and there are four ways to make sense of it: disengagement, transparency, standardization, and portability (each a component of Kohler’s “placeless place”)."[Gieryn, Thomas F. *Truth-Spots: How Places Make People Believe*. University of Chicago Press, 2018.]

08. "Conan Doyle’s short story “The Dancing Men” provides a similar riddle for Holmes to solve. What if that easy hoax code overlaid a genuine ancient inscription of similar appearance, to which the hoaxer had only to make a few additions and alterations?In that case we are dealing with a stone palimpsest, something from which the original writing has been erased or covered to make way for further writing. Historically, the process was usually applied to parchments and monumental brasses which were turned and re-engraved on the reverse side."[Fanthorpe, Lionel *The Oak Island Mystery: World’s Greatest Treasure Hunt*. Dundurn, 2012.]

09. "Dealing with the suspense, excitement and body of an organic silence, the restriction and freedom of absence, the plastic fullness of nothing, the point a circle begins and ends. This language seems much more compatible with Buddhism than with Judeo-Christianity. The “plastic fullness of nothing” and the “body of an organic silence” recall Cage’s phrasings in “Lecture on Something. ” In February 1951, Cage said: “[I]t is of the utmost importance not to make a thing but rather to make nothing."[Larson, Kay *Where the Heart Beats: John Cage, Zen Buddhism, and the Inner Life of Artists*. Reprint. Penguin Books, 2012.]

10. "THE DESIGN OF TYPES 69] and this may also prove entirely original in effect and with no radical departure in form or loss of any of the essential qual. . , ities of good tradition. To make a demand for greater origi. . , nality than I suggest here is likely to restrict natural growth. The real ends of type design are utility, fitness, and pleasing readability; design means progress in response to changing conditions of life, environment, needs, and aspirations."[Goudy, Frederic W. *Typologia: Studies in Type Design and Type Making*. University of California Press, 1978.]

11. "Frederic Remington, Jimmie Friday, 1896. Halftone illustration, Harper’s Monthly, August 1896. phrasing in the epigraph to this section of the chapter, in exploring how seeing “something noticeable” (the hatless hunter as “stranger” figure) “makes you see something you weren’t noticing” (the specter of Jimmie Friday), which in turn can lead one to see something that doesn’t seem to be “even visible,” at least on the surface of things. That “something” not entirely visible — but not entirely erased either in The Hunters’ Supper — is what Simmel, for one, would undoubtedly urge us to notice at some point in our consideration of this painting’s particular “hypnotic value”: how the stylized nocturnal fantasy and spatial relations in The Hunters’ Supper implicitly testify to the form of social relations, technological development, and economic activity in the Remington moment."[Tatum, Stephen *In the Remington Moment*. University of Nebraska Press, 2010.]

12. "Even outside the natural sciences proper, diagramming systems are the choice for "describing, interpreting, and communicating complex phenomena difficult to encompass with verbal or mathematical language" (Wrolstad and Fisher 1986: 131). As Charles Owen (1986: 156) points out, "the diagram is special in its ability to render the invisible visible. "It can be efficient and precise, and it can make a powerful statement. Maps, for example, express spatial relationships especially well."[Boone, Elizabeth Hill, and Walter D. Mignolo *Writing Without Words: Alternative Literacies in Mesoamerica and the Andes*. Duke University Press Books, 1994.]

13. "TECHNO TEXTILES 127 Kawakubo was renowned for her abstract instructions to her pattern-cutters, seamstresses and textile designers. She might tell Matsushita, for example, that she would like something using thin thread, rather than bulky thread, or something with a cold feel, something flat as opposed to something bumpy, something with depth and texture."[English, Bonnie *Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2011.]

14. "For this, it may be interesting to compare the etymologies of the English word and its Sino-Japanese counterpart, shodo (書道). The English word “calligraphy” is a combination of two Greek words, kallos, meaning “beautiful,” and grafos, meaning “something written. ” Thus, calligraphy in the West is something beautifully written, a linear grouping of individual letters in a graceful or ornate style, and it can be used apropos to anything from wedding invitations to diplomas to the Book of Kells. Shodo, however, is another matter."[Wilson, William Scott *The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi*. Reprint. Shambhala, 2013.]

15. "If it is impossible to reach perfection, “practice” can’t logically  Piano Lessons to Nobody “make perfect. ” Nor does “perfect practice make perfect,” which is a marketing slogan golf teachers have become fond of repeating in their articles, books, and videos; perfect practice is as impossible to achieve as any other kind of perfection. When we learn to do something that requires our “practical intelligence,” we need a teacher beside us who can actually observe what we are doing and make the needed suggestions and adjustments designed to correct our faulty technique."[Brumer, Andy *The poetics of golf*. Apparent First Edition. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2007.]

16. "As for the reproach that I have read things into the work of ancient authors, I think  it is always a good thing to have something to read into something else. Moreover,  every good interpreter has always skillfully read something into the text at the appropriate moment. 394. Our ignorance of the lost encaustic technique makes it impossible to translate  this passage: itôai toùtoiç f| eiKwv KeKocrgfjOo ôwc âxpi tôu emKexpwoOtl govou, àXX' ëç  pd0os ôeuaottaiôiç nai <J>apgàicoiç ès xopov Kaxa|3a<t>€iaa [With all of these the picture is  embellished, and not merely tinted on the surface but stained down deep to the full  with permanent dyes].

17. "Their approach was simplicity itself (which didn’t make it easy). Make a synthetic nucleic acid, run it through a ribosome (which assembles proteins), and see what comes out. First, put in a strand of all U’s (uracil, a stand-in for T, in this case). Out comes a synthetic molecule made solely of the amino acid phenylalanine, multiple copies joined head-to-tail like a protein. So UUU (the code was formed of three bases) means phenylalanine."[(ed.), Michael Sappol *Hidden Treasure  The National Library of Medicine*. Blast Books, 2012.]

18. "It’s round, just like a tube of jersey. I wanted to make something woven, that was warped like African bark. ’ (Penn 1988: 15) In Miyake’s work, the process of simplification dictated the use of a single piece of fabric that flowed over the body. His sculptural creations symbolize a purist approach to design, as his garments seem to become art forms in themselves. His Japanese affinity with nature inspires shapes in his clothing which are reminiscent of shells, stones ISSEY MIYAKE 23 Figure 1. 4 Sayuri Shimoda/Nuno Corporation, textile—Sashiko Flower, 1986."[English, Bonnie *Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo*.

19. "The human agent wishes to give apprehensible form to certain inchoate feelings and images, but the medium of the language necessarily adapts these mental materials to its own special structures. Such adaptations involve selection rather than detailed imitations, for nothing verbal could provide an accurate model of anything mental. The verbal rendition becomes something symbolic standing for something else in the consciousness."[Bridgman, Richard *Traveling in Mark Twain (A Quantum Book)*. University of California Press, 1987.]

20. "Everything in a building matters, from the doorknobs to the paint details. And sculpture is like writing a poem. You’re not saying as much. It’s an idea stripped bare. ” There was one professor, a noted architect named Frank Gehry, who told her to ignore the pressure to specialize and just make the things she wanted to make. It was “the best advice . . . I’ve ever been given from the architectural world. ” Lin did take the required architecture courses."[Lashnits, Tom *Maya Lin*. New York: Chelsea House, 2007.]

21. "And although mass-produced objects lose the “authenticity” of the original,17 mass-produced collectibles still retain magic through their myriad associations with their historical contexts. As we have seen, the collector wants to know everything about the collectible; the Disneyana newsletters and websites provide the facts and stories that make Mickey in porcelain more than a fetish. Memorabilia is designed to evoke a string of memories. 18 By collecting, we “singularize” the commodity, turning it into something unique to be admired in a world of mass production, conformity, and utility."[Cross, Gary *Consumed Nostalgia: Memory in the Age of Fast Capitalism*. Columbia University Press, 2015.]

22. "The jotter pad offers only vague locative information. That crucial scribble could be anywhere. Notebooks need a ‘search’ function. The growing popularity of note-taking apps like Notes on the iPhone and Evernote seems to offer one way of overcoming this problem. Allowing you to sync notes and thoughts between different devices in an easily searchable format threatens to make the habit of writing something down in a book made out of paper seem like an increasingly archaic habit. However, the two formats don’t have to live in opposition."[Ward, James *Adventures in Stationery: A Journey Through Your Pencil Case*. Profile Books, 2015.]

23. ". . . Every cultural act lives on boundaries; in this is its seriousness and significance. ”26 Boundaries make creativity possible. Their abutments offer the physical sites for the resonance of many voices, for dialogue. In language that gives immediacy to the performance of aesthetic activity, Bakhtin enacts the visual dialogue of dandies, who, as observed and observers, raise the stakes of both enterprises."[Fillin-Yeh, Susan *Dandies: Fashion and Finesse in Art and Culture*. New York University Press, 2001.]

24. "Engineering does not deal just in secrets, of course, but those are among the realities of private industry. Corporations necessarily must have some advantage if they are to recover the investment that they make in retaining consulting engineers and in maintaining an engineering staff to carry out the research and development required to manufacture a new product or even to continue to make an old product when the traditional supplies of materials become unavailable. Once a newly developed product is released to the marketplace, it also becomes available to the competition."[Petroski, Henry *The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance*. Alfred A. Knopf, 2010.]

25. "It's a prayer for whoever receives this, whether they buy it or whether it's given to them, that it only brings them happiness. For each article that I make over a long period of time, I will put more of my feelings into it. Everything that I make I try to make with the utmost quality in mind. I don't approve of making something with a frivolous attitude. Because no matter where that piece goes, I go with it, because I put something into it. And so I don't want, even unknowingly, for an article that I've made to go out and within two weeks or two months for it to come apart, with normal use. Of course, if something's going to be Page 130 abused, well, it's not going to survive, and it doesn't have anything to do with me. ANN: Now, talking about having something to do with you, is there a process that you go through to spiritually prepare to make an outfit? Are there special moments that you set aside for that, or is there a situation where your design processes come to you spiritually?"[Ackerman, Lillian A. *A Song to the Creator: Traditional Arts of Native American Women of the Plateau*. University of Oklahoma Press, 1996.]
