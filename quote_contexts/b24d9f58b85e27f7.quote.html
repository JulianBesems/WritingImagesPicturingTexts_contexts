      <li>&quot;In order to analyze in more detail the transition in the semantics,  we note that, in the former case, a continuous function from a base  topological space   to the topological space   can be considered as  a continuous section from   to the product space  . This product  space is set-theoretically isomorphic to a space containing a copy of the  coordinatizing frame-field   at each point, being the inverse image of  the projection from   to the base  .&quot;[INPUT: Zafiris - 2021 - Natural Communication The Obstacle-Embracing Art .pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;X3 &quot; F, • x, &quot; Figure 12. 20 Geometrical interpretation of the mappings performed by the network in Figure 12. 1 g for the case of 0 = 3 inputs and AI = 2 units in the middle hidden layer. The function F, maps from an M-dimensional space S into a D-dimensiooal space and therefore defines the way in which the space S is embedded within the original x-space. Since the mapping F, can be r&quot;I()(llinear, the embedding 01 S can be nonplanar, as indicated in the figure. The mapping F. then defines a projectiorl of points in the original D-dimensional space into the M -dimensional subspace S. &quot;[INPUT: Bishop - 2006 - Pattern recognition and machine learning.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;We now explain how to view these estimates (9) and (10) as projection methods. We therefore introduce a normed vector space, denoted by VS that contains the space of data vectors and the space of candidate regression functions. Within this vector space one identifies two subspaces: the subspace of the data vectors Y = (Y1 , . . . , Yn )T , denoted by VSY ; and the subspace of the candidate regression functions, denoted by VSm . It will be shown hereafter that in the space VS , the simple smoothers of type (3) appear as projections of the data vector into the subspace VSm .&quot;[Read, Campbell B., N.

<li>&quot;10 On issues of the text throughout, see especially Ross (1953); and Frede and Patzig (1988). Again for reasons of space I have avoided detailed discussion of the many textual cruces in these passages. 316 SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH PLATO one will be the others also;11 for things whose ousia is one and whose essence is one are themselves also one. (1038b12–15) Here the ﬁrst element of the agreement between A and B (that the ousia of each thing is peculiar to it) is restated as the claim that ‘things whose ousia is one and whose essence is one are themselves also one’.&quot;[McCabe, Mary Margaret *Platonic Conversations*. Hardcover. Oxford University Press, USA, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, in our toy example we can use toarray to view a matrix of word counts for each observation: bag_of_words. toarray() array([[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=int64) We can use the vocabulary_ method to view the word associated with each feature: # Show feature names count. get_feature_names() [&#x27;beats&#x27;, &#x27;best&#x27;, &#x27;both&#x27;, &#x27;brazil&#x27;, &#x27;germany&#x27;, &#x27;is&#x27;, &#x27;love&#x27;, &#x27;sweden&#x27;] 104 | Chapter 6: Handling Text This might be confusing, so for the sake of clarity here is what the feature matrix looks like with the words as column names (each row is one observation): beats 0 0 1 best 0 1 0 both 0 0 1 brazil 2 0 0 germany 0 0 1 is 0 1 0 love 1 0 0 sweden 0 1 0 Discussion One of the most common methods of transforming text into features is by using a bag-of-words model.&quot;[Albon, Chris *Machine Learning with Python Cookbook: Practical Solutions from Preprocessing to Deep Learning*.

<li>&quot;The Nazi occupation of Rome during a crucial period delayed contact between Silva and his contemporaries Mackey, Eilenberg, and Mac Lane. ******************************** The groupoids of Klein and the preorders of Dedekind remain useful, but many important categories (such as the categories of directed graphs and of dynamical systems) contain non-invertible maps as well as parallel maps; in fact their maps include with equal status 380 - Appendix III figures in a space, functions on a space, projections from product spaces, transformations of one space into another inclusions of subspaces, functionals.&quot;[Lawvere, F. William, and Stephen H. Schanuel *Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories*. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Perhaps more interesting from a statistical point of view is that points of inflection in Cartesian space become cusps in parallel coordinate space and vice versa. Thus the relatively hard-to-detect inflectionpoint property of a function becomes the notably easier-to-detect cusp in the parallelcoordinate representation. Inselberg [6] discusses these properties in detail. STATISTICAL INTERPRETATIONS Since ellipses map into hyperbolas, one has an easy template for diagnosing uncorrelated data pairs.&quot;[Read, Campbell B., N. Balakrishnan, Brani Vidakovic, and Samuel Kotz *Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences*. 2nd. Wiley-Interscience, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Moreover, in natural space–time systems, the variables can be grouped by type. For this, the concept of space is used. A data table of the kind presented here forms the data space. As will be 2. 3 SAMPLING FOR PATTERN RECOGNITION 15 shown later (Chapter 4), there are other, even more abstract spaces such as the resemblance space. At this point, some subtypes of data space are considered: The biological space. This consists of the attribute vectors describing the biotic part of the system, such as plant species, plant cover, animal species, population sizes, life forms, functional traits, etc.&quot;[Wildi(auth.), Otto *Data Analysis in Vegetation Ecology, Second Edition*.

<li>&quot;Leibniz’s source here is probably Hobbes, who gives the same two equivalent characterizations of situation in his De Corpore (Hobbes 1668: Part II, chapter 14, §§ 21–2). In the first sense, a situation corresponds to a cell of Leibniz’s infinitely divided space; in the second sense, every figured body in space has a situation with respect to a given point of view. So far this may not seem promising, since these lines, proportions and angles would have to be embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space (a 3-space).&quot;[Arthur, Richard T.W. *Leibniz*. Polity, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Usually X alone is sufficient notation. We regard any subspace of X as a fibrewise space over B by restricting the projection. When p is a fibration we describe X as fibrant, and this class of fibrewise spaces has special properties. We regard B as a fibrewise space over itself using the identity as projection. We regard the topological product T x B, for any space T, as a fibrewise space over B using the second projection. Let X be a fibrewise space over B.&quot;[James, I.M. *Handbook of Algebraic Topology*. Amsterdam; New York: Elsevier Science B.V, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;It permits one to locate individuals on several attitudinal dimensions instead of just one. Weisberg and Rusk [27], as an example, wanted to know which factors (partisanship, ideology, issues, personality) affected people’s evaluation of 12 candidates. They also wanted to know how many dimensions people use to evaluate candidates. Employing a nonmetric multidimensional scaling routine, the investigators found that candidate evlauations as well as certain attitude preferences required a two-dimensional space with one axis representing traditional left-right politics, the other a newer left-right division.&quot;[Read, Campbell B., N. Balakrishnan, Brani Vidakovic, and Samuel Kotz *Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences*. 2nd. Wiley-Interscience, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;110this terminology is from classical geometry 111The point of the new notation is psychological: we view S as a variable in the construction Γ(X, −) which assigns something to each sheaf on X. 112We will see later that this idea has a hidden part, the cohomology S7→H • (X, S) of sheaves on X. 113When one views the blow up V e as a space over P(V ), it is called the tautological line bundle on a projective space P(V ), or the tautological line subbundle on a projective space. The specification subbundle is to remind us that Ve ⊆ P(V )×V is a vector subbundle of the trivial vector bundle P(V )×V on P(V ).&quot;[Mirkovic, Ivan *Idea of space in algebraic geometry: a picture book of algebraic geometry*. version 17 Aug 2005. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;This distinction, ﬁrst presented in Deduction 1, becomes a persistent theme throughout Part Two. 43 By turning from the consideration of the One to that of the Others, Deduction 3 focuses our attention on plurality. Deduction 3 is at ﬁrst concerned with the structure of unity in a whole composed of parts 41 42 43 On the other hand, in the expanded scheme reported later, which stretches from the One above to the Indeterminate Dyad below, there is a more positive role for the notion of a One without plurality.&quot;[Kahn, Charles H. *Plato and the Post-Socratic Dialogue: The Return to the Philosophy of Nature*.

<li>&quot;Remember that the number of dimensions in the feature space is just the number of features. So the feature space for our example regression tree has two dimensions and we can visualize how this space is split up into rectangular regions as follows: The rule-based interpretation and the space partitioning interpretation are equivalent views of the same model. The space partitioning interpretation in particular is very useful in helping us appreciate one particular characteristic of decision trees, which is that they must have complete coverage over all possible combinations of input features.&quot;[Forte, Rui Miguel *Mastering Predictive Analytics with R*. Packt Publishing, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;In fact, the current work was inspired on the previous one, but attempting to skip its two main drawbacks: (1)little eﬃciency. - since it requires a two-step process and the ﬁrst one includes K-MPEs and (2)being this simpliﬁcation K-MPE guided the obtained solutions are somehow inﬂuenced by them. As we have just veriﬁed, in many occasions the K-best explanations do not correspond to K diﬀerent scenarios, because some explanations should have been aggregated into one. Remember the previous example, where 7 of the 10th best explanations could be summarised in only one.&quot;[Holmes, Dawn E., Lakhmi C. Jain (auth.), Prof. Dawn E. Holmes, and Prof. Lakhmi C.
