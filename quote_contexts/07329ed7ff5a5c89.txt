Selected: This synthesis of the manifold of sensible intuition, which is possible and necessary a priori, can be called figurative (synthesis speciosa), as distinct from that which would be thought in the mere category in regard to the manifold of an intuition in general, and which is called combination of the understanding (synthesis intellectualis); both are transcendental, not merely because they themselves proceed a priori but also because they ground the possibility of other cognition a priori. Yet the figurative synthesis, if it pertains merely to the original synthetic unity of apperception, i. e. , this transcendental unity, which is thought in the categories, must be called, as distinct from the merely intellectual combination, the transcendental synthesis of the imagination.[Immanuel Kant, Paul Guyer (Editor, Allen W.

03. "This transcendental principle of the mathematics of appearances yields a great expansion of our a priori cognition. For it is this alone that makes pure mathematics in its complete precision applicable to objects of experience, which without this principle would not be so obvious, and has indeed caused much contradiction. Appearances are not things in themselves. Empirical intuition is possible only through the pure intuition (of space and time); what geometry says about the latter is therefore undeniably valid of the former, and evasions, as if objects of the senses did not have to be in agreement with the rules of construction in space (e. g. , the rules of the infinite divisibility of lines or angles), must cease."[Immanuel Kant, Paul Guyer (Editor, Allen W.

15. "And Kant suggests that all of the other concepts traditionally applied to the soul in rational theology are derived from combining these in various ways; for example, ‘immateriality,’ ‘personality,’ ‘spirituality,’ ‘immortality,’ and ‘embodiment’ (331). Now the validity of applying these derivative concepts to the thinking subject is obviously dependent upon the validity of applying to it the more basic concepts of ‘substance,’ ‘simplicity,’ ‘identity’ through time, and ‘relation’ to possible objects in space."[Schacht, Richard *Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant*.
