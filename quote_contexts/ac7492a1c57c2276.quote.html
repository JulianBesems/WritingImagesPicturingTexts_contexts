    <pre>4.1.1 FLOOR

<em>The floor of the building was a dimly lit, drab area with concrete walls and a grey, checkered floor. The only light came from a few flickering fluorescent tubes overhead, casting an eerie glow over the space. The air was stale and musty, thick with the scent of old books and dampness. A row of worn, wooden benches lined one wall, facing a large, stone pedestal that supported a massive, leather-bound tome.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;Structure is largely steel, over a concrete ground floor. The upper floors have, in effect, a double wall with the louvres shading a glass box that has movable panes so spaces can be cooled naturally as well as by air conditioning.&quot;[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;The concrete columns and wall elements were dictated by structural requirements. The floor has hollow core planks spanning between ribs of shallow T beams that were supported on deep precast beams.&quot;[Bennett, David *The art of precast concrete: colour texture expression*. Basel; Boston: Birkhäuser, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Slab-on-grade Concrete floor that is supported directly on the earth or fill. Slat A thin, narrow strip of wood, often one of a series used within a framework to regulate the passage of light and air into an area.&quot;[Ernest., Burden *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The ground floor is like a basement, containing the entrance (ajard), storage (tali ni ajard). Off the first stairway landing is the toilet (tajammi) with a cess pit below.&quot;[Ragette, Friedrich *Traditional Domestic Architecture Of The Arab Region*. Hardcover. Axel Menges, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;The space and light of this central spine are architecturally unforgettable. From the entrance level (a short utility floor) one takes an escalator or elevator to tax and auditing services on the second floor, or to administration and public works on the third floor; other departments are on the top floor together with the near-circular library under the central dome.&quot;[Smith, George Everard Kidder *Source Book of American Architecture: 500 Notable Buildings from the 10th Century to the Present*.

<li>&quot;Services – ventilation and acoustic separation – are carried by the concrete structure. On the lower ground floor, it was possible to eliminate the heavy central wall and replace it with a folding screen to create one enormous space.&quot;[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]</li>

<li>&quot;(Notice the similarity between this wall construction, and our own mill-floor construction. )A small mountain of beams thicker in section than the wall beams, but less than a tenth in number, grooved on one side, would represent the girts or wall beams at the floor levels, grooved on the inside face to receive the ends or edges of floor boards.&quot;[Dana, William S B *Swiss Chalet Book: An Elegant Guide to Architecture and Design*.

<li>&quot;On the internal precast wall the surface has been board-marked and the colour is a light natural stone. We wanted concrete as it was a very hard-wearing, durable material.&quot;[Bennett, David *The art of precast concrete: colour texture expression*. Basel; Boston: Birkhäuser, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;The north wall itself is primarily illuminated by light reflected back from the clear, blank surface of the south wall. For Siza, the clerestory in the north wall carries significant associations: You have this angle that gives some depth to the windows.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*.
