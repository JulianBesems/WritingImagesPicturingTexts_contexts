01. "Cylinder glass, also called broad or sheet glass, provided larger sheets of glass of uniform thickness, but it was more brittle than well-made crown glass. The latter provided material of higher quality with fewer inherent imperfections. The cylinder glass method required several steps. A large cylinder of glass was blown on a blow pipe and scored; when cooled, the ends were removed, and the cylinder was slit lengthwise."[York, New *Repairing Old and Historic Windows: A Manual for Architects and Homeowners*. Washington, D.C: Preservation Press, National Trust for Historic Preservation, 1992.]

04. "Performance Assessments The intent of this section was to present developments around the performance of insulating glass and glass facades. One paper discussed in-situ dew point testing to assess life span of insulating glass units. A second presented an assessment of annual energy consumption of ventilated double glass facades using computer simulation."[Valerie L. Block, editor *The Use of Glass in Buildings: 1st Symposium on the Use of Glass in Buildings, 2002, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (ASTM Special Technical Publication, 1434)*. 2002.]

05. "The bridge spans three metres with floor plates of 15mm laminated float glass supported on two laminated glass beams made from float glass. The side-walls consist of double glazed units made from 10mm and 6mm thick toughened glass sheet. In addition to being self-supporting, the walls support the glass roof, which has the same type of laminated construction as the walls."[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*. Ambra Verlag, 2013.]

06. "While previously used to primarily enhance windows and doors, contemporary home designers are using stained glass to enhance and create entire spaces in homes. Beveled Glass Doors Stained glass window Glass blocks are used in a window that separates rooms. Block Glass Window Panel Try glass blocks instead of a room screen or etched glass to create a view."[M.K., Makridakis, and Holland M. *How to Create Rooms of Radiance.

08. "The Si0 4 tetrahedra form a three-dimensional 20 THE COMPOSITION OF GLASS network in the glass. In crystalline forms of silica, e. g. quartz, the Si0 4 tetrahedra form a regular network. In glass, however, the network is irregular. This indicates that glass is not a crystalline substance (Figure 3. 2). In a physical sense glass is not a solid, but rather a supercooled liquid."[(auth.), Rune Persson *Flat Glass Technology*. Springer US, 1969.]

10. "Tempered Glass - Fully tempered (FT) glass is reheated to just below the softening point (about 1300°F or 704. 4°C) and then rapidly cooled. Thickness - The dimension between the two surfaces of a panel of glass, other than its length or width. Tinted Glass - Body-colored glass with specific ingredients formulated to produce light reducing and/or heat absorbing glass products."[Garg, N.K. *Guidelines for Use of Glass in Buildings*. New Age Publications (Academic), 2007.]

11. "It is not unusual for bent glass on SGF projects to cross national borders. Two highly regarded architectural glass-bending specialists regularly deliver to a global market; Cricursa from its factory outside Barcelona, Spain, and Cristacurva from its plant near Guadalajara, Mexico, are both producers of high-end architectural curved glass. Glass-bending technology for automotive glass far surpasses that for architectural glass because of the large quantities of identical units that are characteristic of the former industry."[Patterson, Mic *Structural Glass Facades and Enclosures : a Vocabulary of Transparency*. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, 2011.]

13. "Their intention is usually to maximise transparency, and their application on single storey enclosures ensures that glass sheets can form walls without the need for aluminium or steel framing. Typically, double glazed units are set vertically, with examples 1500mm wide x 3000mm high. These larger size panels require glass fins set vertically to take the place of glass mullions, but glass units 2100mm high sometimes do not require any glass fins, depending on the wind load."[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*. Ambra Verlag, 2013.]

14. "By inserting a wire mesh during the process of manufacture a wired glass will be obtained (Figure 2. 8). The wire mesh is drawn in on top of a ribbon of glass and 16 PLATE GLASS after passing a second pair of rollers, another ribbon of glass is formed on top of the wire.

15. "Mistakenly called bulletproof, this glass is formed using various polycarbonate layers clad with glass."[Dodson, David W., and John Mittendorf *The Art of Reading Buildings*. PennWell,Fire Engineering Books, 2014.]

16. "Global building standards increasingly specify stricter safety requirements where any breakage could mean a major hazard from falling glass and glass floors. • Laminated glass resists intrusion because the interlayer continues to safeguard the building even after the glass itself is broken. It cannot be cut from only one sides, so ordinary glasscutters are useless as break-in tools."[Garg, N.K. *Guidelines for Use of Glass in Buildings*. New Age Publications (Academic), 2007.]

17. "Although glass is a dielectric material and does not conduct electricity, electro-optical glass ﬁlm “heats up” and can melt ice (Addington and Schodek 2005: 156). Other ﬁlms allow transparent projection surfaces to appear on the glass screen, unaffected by ambient light (Brownell 2006: 149)."[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]

20. "Crown glass is the finest sort of ordinary window glass. Plate glass is the superior kind of thick glass used for mirrors, shop windows, etc. It will be noted that it is the only kind of glass which contains soda. The process of glass manufacture comprises three stages, mixing, melting, and blowing. The various ingredients are first finely ground and then thoroughly mixed by the aid of a mixer, forming what is known as the “batch. ” This is placed in melting pots."[Sydney, Lewis J. *Old Glass and How to Collect it*. Palala Press, 2016.]

21. "Plate glass could also be polished and appear flawless. In the 1880s Chance Brothers introduced sheet glass which was also polished but thinner and cheaper. Combined with the repeal of the glass tax in 1851, expanses of glass could now be used on relatively ordinary houses. Some of the grandest Tudor houses had sections of coloured and painted glass in their most important windows."[Lewis, Philippa *House  British Domestic Architecture*. Prestel, 2011.]

22. "Guidance is given in BS 952 Part 1: BS 6262 and Glass in Building ed. D. Button. IStructE Cladding The use of glass as cladding may vary from the simple pane of glass in a window to a highly sophisticated glass facade in which the structural properties of glass are fully exploited. The latter may make extensive use of silicone adhesives."[Britain), Institution of Structural Engineers (Great, and Structural Engineers Trading Organisation *Aspects of cladding: of interest to structural engineers, architects, surveyors, contractors, building owners, clients, local authorities*. SETO, 1995.]

23. "Laminated glass may exhibit increased distortion if the rollerwave of each piece is coincident, producing a lens effect. (Excessive roller-wave in laminated glass can also cause delamination. ) All tempered glass will exhibit some level of roller-wave, but the magnitude can vary widely among manufacturers. In high-quality frameless glass systems, roller-wave is an important consideration, and an appropriate tolerance should be determined and specified. Roller-wave is easily measured using specialized devices designed for this purpose. Unfortunately, in the United States, the industry standard for heat-treated glass, ASTM C1048 2004 Standard Specification for Heat-Treated Flat Glass—Kind HS, Kind FT Coated and Uncoated Glass, discusses distortion but defines no tolerance or minimum standard."[Patterson, Mic *Structural Glass Facades and Enclosures : a Vocabulary of Transparency*.
