Selected: In A Thousand Plateaus this whole problem is discussed under the rubric smooth and striated spaces. A smooth space is a nonmetric intensive space, ‘one of distances, not of measures’, whereas a striated space is an extensive space, with a closed, parcelled out or measured surface (Deleuze 1987: 479).[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]

01. "Ifwe bring to bear sorne complexity theory terms, we can say that a full statement of 'geophilosophy' would be that aIl bodies on the strata occupying a striated space arise through the congealing or cooling of an intensive process forming a smooth space and subtended by the singularities inhabiting the virtual plane of consistency ('phase space' or 'state space')."[Bonta, Mark, and John Protevi *Deleuze and Geophilosophy: A Guide and Glossary (Deleuze Connections)*. Edinburgh University Press, 2004.]

02. "(SD 15; 176). Second, it is important to note that GT unfolds within and out of a metaphysical space, especially in the first chapter. Specifically it must be remembered that “performativity,” in its first appearance, is designated explicitly as a metaphysical concept (GT 33)."[(Editor), Roland Faber, Michael Halewood (Editor), Deena Lin (Editor), Jeffrey A.

03. "To think means to be embedded in the present-time stratum that serves as a limit. [F 98, 119] - E. B. Y. Striated space 1. Space designed for a sedentary lifestyle, where movement concerns the relationship between points or nodes which are imported onto it from a higher plane or another dimension; the dimensional movement of territorialized milieus, in distinction from directional movement within lines of flight or smooth space."[Young, Eugene B., Gary Genosko, and Janell Watson *The Deleuze and Guattari Dictionary*.

06. "See Figure 2. STRIATED SPACE [espace strié]: space marked by striae (striations); metric or measured space. Just as smooth space is the product of intensification, striated space is the product of stratification, especiallyas effectuated by the State apparatus (385; 441)."[Bonta, Mark, and John Protevi *Deleuze and Geophilosophy: A Guide and Glossary (Deleuze Connections)*. Edinburgh University Press, 2004.]

07. "They 66 Todd Jerome Satter elaborate: ‘In contrast to the sea, the city is the striated space par excellence; the sea is a smooth space fundamentally open to striation, and the city is the force of striation that reimparts smooth space, puts it back into operation everywhere, on earth and in the other elements, outside but also inside itself’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 481)."[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]

08. "Striated space is given a function, which is imparted on a subject, while smooth space allows subjects to distribute themselves within and throughout space to form a new assemblage (human-building-environment)."[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]
