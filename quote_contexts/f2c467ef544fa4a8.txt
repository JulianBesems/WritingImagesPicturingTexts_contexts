Selected: They descended single-file, even though the stair was empty when they entered, so that anyone that attempted to come up the stair could pass them. Around the 10th floor, the person with her offered her part of his shirt to block out the strong smell of jet fuel in the stair. They then had to ascending up three levels due to further passage in that stair being impossible; the second stair had the same result of starting to descend before having to return to a higher floor and change stairs.[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A.

04. "If one used a flow rate of 26 occ/min/unit, a single 1100 mm (44 in) stair could serve 2160 people (4320 for two stairs) and a 1400 mm (56 in) stair could serve 2750 people (5500 for two stairs).

11. "34, para. 6, sent. 2 of the MBO specifies that stairs must be fitted with handrails on both sides and intermediate handrails where this is necessary for safety reasons. However, some federal state building regulations stipulate this for stairs in buildings with more than two dwellings reached via stairs. If stepless access (i. e. ramp or lift) to these dwellings is not possible, the use of the stairs by older occupants should be made safer and more comfortable by providing a handrail on both sides."[Heiss, Oliver *Barrier-Free Design*.

The model permits to represent the interactions between horizontal and vertical components. Stairs in STEPS There are two different methods to simulate stairs in STEPS. A possible method is the use of the stair menu (see Fig. 4. 24). This menu permits to define the geometric characteristics of the stairs (e. g. , width, height, handrails, walking side, etc."[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*.

14. "This option indicates that the capacity for stairs in NFPA 130 is used for stairs over or under 4 % of slope in the up or down direction. Users can also modify this default setting with the desired flows and speeds through stairs. An alternative method is the definition of a plane with the shape of the stair under consideration. This method is particularly effective when the shape of the stair is not conventional (e. g. , spiral stairs)."[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*.

15. "Stairs Semicircular stairs nestled between walls of foundation skirting is an excellent feature for distinguishing a fairly undistinguished deck. This small, gray dining deck also features natural wood railings with glass inserts, but it’s the stairs that set a truly sophisticated tone. This is why choosing stair style is always a part of a good deck design—they should never be an afterthought Stair configuration goes far in determining how the deck is perceived."[Peterson, Chris *Deck ideas you can use: creative deck designs for every home & yard*.

After reading the above, you may well decide to hire an expert to build all the stairs in your house.
