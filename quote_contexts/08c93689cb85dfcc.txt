Selected: These experiences show us that color and images generally "may be there where the thing seen is not" (pp. 4-5). The image seen by reflection in a glass "is not any thing in or behind the glass. "The image and color "is but an apparition to us" of the motion of object and nerves. Thus again, two senses of light are distinguished: motion in and from the object, and the appearance or image. We should perhaps guard against crediting too strong a psychological content to these various words used by Hobbes.[Yolton, John W. *Perceptual Acquaintance from Descartes to Reid*. 1984.]

02. "Cornelia Kemp cites an especially inte�sting example in the Saint Leonard cycle in Apfeltrach: the proper name contains a double propositional concept ("lco" + "nantus") that inspires the two parts of the cyc1e$ of images. 9.

"To reinforce the distinction between essellCe and definition, bear in mind that although a thing has only one essence. this can be exp�ssed by several definitions. just as tbe same structure or the same town can be represented by different drawings in perspective depending on the direction from which it is viewed. "'"[Deleuze, Gilles *Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque (Athlone Contemporary European Thinkers)*. Athlone Press, 1993.]

03. "Yet the visual metaphor must itself be understood in terms of a certain μεταφέρειν, a way of carrying something of the thing over from one place to another. In vision, an attribute of the thing is carried over into perceiving by the medium of light; in thinking, the way each thing “is seen” (εἶδος) is carried over into thinking, the “place of forms,”65 by the medium that is the φαντασία. This conveyance into thinking is, however, a natural movement belonging to the nature of things."[Long, Christopher P. *Aristotle on the Nature of Truth*. Cambridge University Press, 2010.]

04. "Then we are in a position to know what property something has on the basis of how it looks. The process might not be as simple as: the thing looks w1, so it has property p1—it might be more complicated than that. But the point remains: visual experience is a source of knowledge of what properties things have. Note, also, that once equipped with this theory we can present the visual experience facts in a more informative way: rather than saying that this thing looks w1, we can say that this thing looks the way p1 things look (we might even just say that this thing looks p1)."[Breckenridge, Wylie *Visual Experience: A Semantic Approach*. Oxford University Press, 2018.]

05. "(Note that this is a somewhat technical use of ‘illusion’—it is not quite how we would use it in non-philosophical contexts. In this sense of ‘illusion’ much of our daily visual experience is illusory, but in the sense of ‘illusion’ in which we commonly use it this is not so. )According to the account of visual experience that I have developed in this book, there is something strange about comparing the way that an object looks with the way that the object is. The way that an object looks is a way of looking—a way in which looking events occur."[Breckenridge, Wylie *Visual Experience: A Semantic Approach*. Oxford University Press, 2018.]

06. "As the entity or source self has many Aspects, so any one personagram could also be considered as only one larger Aspect-print in itself, of a still more extensive personagram. (T h e Aspect-prints, again, represent traces o f another Aspect o f the entity. )So one such personagram such as Seth would represent only one face o f the entity; one multidimensional Aspect of m any; one characteristic in the nature of a kind o f entity we can hardly comprehend. M any such personagrams, then, would be needed to show the facets o f the entity or give any blueprint o f its characteristics or purposes."[Roberts, Jane *Adventures in Consciousness: An Introduction to Aspect Psychology*. Paperback. Prentice Hall, 1978.]

07. "Again, it is not obvious what to say about this. As far as I can see, the account of visual experience that I have developed in this book does nothing to help answer this question. The theory tells us this: the character of your visual experience changes just in case the way in which it occurs changes. But it does not tell us whether or not the way in which it occurs does change in these cases. We might try looking at the ‘look’ sentences that we could use to correctly describe the character of our experience on each way of understanding the diagram."[Breckenridge, Wylie *Visual Experience: A Semantic Approach*. Oxford University Press, 2018.]

08. "This holds even in the case of perceiving what is going on around one; for to be able to receive impressions from sources external to one, one must have parts which are affected (that is, moved) in some way by these impressions. So Leibniz says: ‘The monads have no windows through which anything could come in or go out’ (148). Each monad is thus completely selfcontained, and has no way of interacting with any other monad. Leibniz 47 Yet the monads must have qualities; ‘otherwise,’ according to Leibniz, ‘they would not even be beings’ (148)."[Schacht, Richard *Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant*. New edition. Routledge, 1984.]

09. "This situation typically arises when Kant uses both a germanic and a latinate word that would be translated into English by the same word, e. g. , "Gegenstand" and "Object, " both of which are translated into English as "object. "In some such cases it may be a matter of interpretation whether Kant means precisely the same thing or not, so we have preserved the information about his usage by marking the Latinate member of the pair in the footnotes, but have not imposed any interpretation of the distinction in the text."[Immanuel Kant, Paul Guyer (Editor, Allen W. Wood (Editor Translator), and Translator) *Critique of Pure Reason*. Cambridge University Press, 1998.]

Ibid. , p. 468. 9. Picard, "Essai," pp. 10-11. 10. Ibid. , p. 42. The scholastics asked themselves about the status of mirror images, as a way of explicating knowledge by means of the intentional species. Typically, Suarez insisted that the mirror "in no way prevents our looking at the object: it does not put between us and the object any real image."[Yolton, John W. *Perceptual Acquaintance from Descartes to Reid*. 1984.]

11. "But it is one thing to throw out retinal sensibility altogether as a space-yielding function the moment we find an ambiguity in its deliverances, and another thing to examine candidly the conditions which may have brought the ambiguity about. The former way is cheap, wholesale, shallow; the latter difficult and complicated, but full of instruction in the end. Let us try it for ourselves. In the case of the diagrams 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, the real object, lines meeting or crossing each other on a plane, is [p. 258] replaced by an imagined solid which we describe as seen."[James, William *Principles of Psychology*. 2010.]

12. "Without too much exaggeration one could say that in theory has evolved in modern English into what linguists might call “a marker of irrealis. ” Thus, the data from the two corpora conﬁrm, in a striking way, that two quite different cultural attitudes toward experience and reason are embedded in French and English. The advent of modern corpora (large, electronically searchable databases such as COBUILD’s Bank of English and COBUILD’S French corpus) allows us to explore such differences in a new way."[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*. Oxford, Toronto: Oxford University Press, 2010.]

13. "Here the problems start, for ( 19) would also qualify as a description of a situation in which Suehas the impressionof seeinga blue squareand a red circle. One way to cope with this is to use compound adverbs such as ' ' ' ' square-bluely and square-redly (supplied with adequate logical principles to take care of the relations betweensuch compounds and their constituents ). That would allow one to discriminate between the following two possibilities: (20) Sue seessquare-redly and circle-bluely. (21) Sue seessquare-bluely and circle-redly."[Casati, Roberto, and Achille C. Varzi *Holes and Other Superficialities (Bradford Books)*. 1995.]

14. "It would be much simpler to understand the process, if adding new strokes made the first one visible. There would then be two different objects apperceived as totals, -- paper with one stroke, paper with two strokes; and, blind to the former, he would see all that was in the latter, because he would have apperceived it as a different total in the first instance. A process of this sort occurs sometimes (not always) when the new strokes, instead of Being mere repetitions of the original one, are lines which combine with it into a total effect, say a human face."[James, William *Principles of Psychology*. 2010.]

15. "For the word of another language is as a vocal and written form different, 150 Language and nevertheless it means the same thing, “table. ” This “one and the same” [essence] ﬁrst confers a goal and support to the agreement in linguistic usage. Accordingly the essence must already be posited in advance, in order to be expressible as the same in the same word. (GA 45: 80) We thus need to reﬂect on the fact that the word Heidegger identiﬁes as responsible for Sputnik’s being is not “Sputnik” but die Eile, hurry."[Wrathall, Mark A. *Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History*. Cambridge University Press, 2010.]
