For instance, using generative models, architects can create intricate patterns that evoke the materiality of building envelopes, or simulate the dynamic performance of structures in real-world conditions. This more nuanced approach encourages a deeper understanding of the relationships between architecture, technology, and society, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and dynamic architectural practice.", "suggest_context": "2.2 AN ARCHITECTONIC VIEW ON DIGITAL MULTIMODALITY Contemporary computational design tools have undoubtedly changed the way in which architects develop projects, both adding precision and coordination to architectural practice. Yet this very structuring power often flattens the epistemic richness that architectural multimodality affords. Systems like Revit and Grasshopper reduce architectural representation to interoperable geometries and quantifiable parameters. As Marini critiques, architectural computation has historically evolved through simplification within existing models, translating architectural thought into parametric control systems, where design becomes the manipulation of variables. He notes that due to their overemphasis on geometry, such systems marginalise modes of thinking that resist formalisation; the speculative, discursive, and affective potentials of architecture."}
