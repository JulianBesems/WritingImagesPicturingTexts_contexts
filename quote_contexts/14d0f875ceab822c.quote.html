<em>The matador&#x27;s outfit was adorned with intricate lace and sequins, shimmering under the bright lights of the arena as he strutted confidently onto the catwalk. His partner, a sultry flamenco dancer, swayed seductively to the rhythm of the salsa music, her castanets clinking in perfect syncopation with the beat. As the crowd roared with anticipation, the matador raised his arms, and the dancer responded with a dramatic shimmy, her bolero skirt swirling around her like a whirlwind.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;I knew better than to mention that to my strict Christian mother. But I loved music and craved it, especially Bo Diddley, Motown, and salsa. I often danced in front of my mirror for six hours at a clip. Diddley had fused a 3-2 clave with rhythm and blues, and rock and roll. A Bo Diddley beat was a clave-based motif, clave being the name of the patterns played on two hardwood sticks in Afro-Cuban music ensembles. This syncopated accent on the “off beat” was perfect for the click-and-slip of my pelvis as I bopped around my bedroom dance floor in my early teens.&quot;[Rowlands, Penelope *The Beatles Are Here!: 50 Years after the Band Arrived in America, Writers, Musicians &amp; Other Fans Remember*.

<li>&quot;She stared, unable to move. One of the hooded faces turned toward her as his enormous horse, its hooves sparking ﬁre, cleared her potato rows. The rider’s face was gaunt, bony, his hair in many long braids, their ends secured around clattering bones. He wore a crown of gold; its great jewel reﬂected ﬁre the color of a splash of blood. White moons in the rider’s eye sockets ﬂashed at Leta; he opened his jaws wide like a wolf and laughed.&quot;[Hartwell, DG, and K Cramer *Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy 5*. Eos, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Today, it was “Singing Through the Pain. ” It had been unwise to jiggle braless for seven hours. Everything hurt. That was when I heard someone else singing, and snapping his fingers, too. Every once in a while there was a little shuffling sound, like someone practicing a soft-shoe. “Chupa, chupa,” sang the voice. I was not sure what that meant. “Chupa la paleta, chupa la, chupa la paleta, chupa la…” I turned around. My serenader was five foot zero, whitehaired, and Latino. He looked like a doll, costumed in a fancy pleated-and-embroidered guayabera shirt, pressed slacks, and a dapper straw hat.&quot;[Headley, Maria Dahvana *The Year of Yes*. Hyperion, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Or rather about her husband&#x27;s passion for the King. &quot;I feel like he&#x27;s part of the family, that hes like a big brother I barely knew, but who inspires the people around me. &quot;It is just before &quot;Declaration of Love,&quot; the most spectacular, the most physical of the show&#x27;s nineteen songs. Celine moves from one end of the stage to the other, pulls Andre Coutu and his guitar over to Megos piano, then sits down and finishes the song on her knees. 321 Celine When I sing, I get an extraordinary physical pleasure.&quot;[Germain, Georges-Herbert *Celine: The Authorized Biography*. Dundurn, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;Light projections flitted across the white curtains that hung at one end of the room, and a runway jutted into the crowd. “How are we supposed to find Larissa in here?” Cassidy asked, eyeing the solid wall of impeccably dressed audience members laughing and mingling around her. “Perimeter check,” Zach said. “Let’s walk around the outside of the room and see if we can spot her. ” He held out his hand and Cassidy took it again, feeling the warmth seep into her palm as Zach snaked expertly through the clumps of people lingering on the fringe of the crowd.&quot;[Abbott, Hailey *The Secrets of Boys*. 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;It was a thin line, like a horizon. She had been watching it for what seemed hours, days?Years?If only she could remember her name. The sparks were clustered around the bright line, like bugs around a light. She was one of them. “I got this thing from the military,” said Carlos in breathless Spanish. “It’s like sonar. You can pick up sounds. In case anyone buried under the ruins is still alive. ” “Not likely,” said Eduardo. All around there was nothing but rubble, and the screaming of sirens.&quot;[Hartwell, DG, and K Cramer *Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy 5*. Eos, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Hermione twisted a strand of her honey-colored beggars in spain 309 hair (when was the last time Miri had touched her mother’s hair?Years) around one ﬁnger, transferred the curl to a second ﬁnger, around and around. Twist, twist. Najla rubbed her swollen belly. Councilor Devore, a thin young man with large soft eyes, looked as if he were sitting on hot coals. Finally Jennifer said, “One more addendum to the medical report, which I asked Councilor Devore to leave to general discussion.&quot;[Kress, Nancy *Beggars in Spain*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;The crumhorns pattered on the small moonlit breeze, and all around him, boots, sandals, and soft, loose slippers trod down the wiry grass, skipping and heeling through the same paces that the dancing queen of England had loved once. Scabbards clacked against belts, trailing gowns sighed in the leaves, small bells tingled at hems and wrists. People who bumped into Farrell said, “A thousand pardons, fair sir. ” He could not find Ben anywhere, but he saw Julie sauntering back to him, walking the music like a cat on a fence, saying again, “Dance.&quot;[Beagle, Peter S. *The Folk of the Air*. 1986.]</li>
<li>&quot;There was soft music playing behind the door of Sheila’s room. Sheila was the dance instructor at the hotel, but occasionally she picked up extra money by dealing for the house in private games around Miami. He rapped their signal and when Sheila opened the door he saw that she was still in her Gwen Verdonish skin-tight clothes—musical-comedy red bell-bottoms that went up and around her body like a scuba diver’s rubber suit. She probably had a dozen such outfits. Something about her wiry, dancer’s body struck him as vicious, but he liked her very much.&quot;[Elkin, Stanley *The Dick Gibson Show*. Dalkey Archive Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;It wasn’t like dancing: it was like making love. The music rippled to an end and they stopped dancing and stood staring at each other. ‘Let’s hear it again!’ cried Sybil, like a child, and someone scratched the needle over the gramophone record. Lily hadn’t realised she’d been holding her breath until the music started again. ‘I don’t want it to stop,’ he said, his voice close to her ear. Lily closed her eyes and allowed herself to be pulled closer. While around them, couples danced with exuberance, she and Jamie moved as if to different, slower music.&quot;[Kelly, Cathy *Lessons in Heartbreak*. Downtown Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;It was always the last song to play on the mix CD that traveled with the band from city to city. (Small rituals. )When the Ramones’s track faded, the lights went out and another solid, wall-like wave of painful white noise rolled around inside the hollow venue. “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” composer Richard Strauss’s piece of crescendo-building classical gas, played on the crowd’s communal suspense. In the twentieth century, the composition had become a sort of sound track for pomposity (Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey), disco smarm (it was a big hit for Brazilian instrumentalist Deodato), and the bloat of Fat Elvis’s white jumpsuit years.&quot;[Spitz, Marc *Nobody Likes You: Inside the Turbulent Life, Times, and Music of Green Day*. illustrated.

<li>&quot;I gestured to her that I was going upstairs. She nodded absent-mindedly. Joseph and I made our way upstairs, through a narrow set of stairs. As we went up, the cool night breeze hit my face. There seemed to be a million stars in the sky. We could hear the music from downstairs very clearly. I looked around the terrace and found that many people were sitting around. Some couples were making out. Some stood at the edge of the parapet, looking around at the millions of twinkling lights that looked as magnificent as the stars in the sky.&quot;[Shenoy, Preeti *Life is What You Make it: A Story of Love, Hope and How Determination Can Overcome Even Destiny*. westland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;I was picking up all the nighttime action happening around me like some sort of antenna, and I wanted to feed it through my emotions and transmit it in some way that seemed to make sense to me, and fit right in among that music I was hearing in Club Sept, and what I had been hearing in New York before I left—disco as the beat of man-love, basically, and a sense that dance music was a disguised form of militancy. I wanted my music to have the charged after-hours vigor that homemade French music suddenly didn’t have.&quot;[Jones, Grace, and Paul Morley *I&#x27;ll never write my memoirs*. Array, United States: Gallery Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Twinkle lights and illusion was wrapped around the stair banisters and red roses graced the dining room table and the metal arch in the den. Mamie and her court had been given a bedroom to get ready in. The Luckadeau ladies were crowded around a vanity helping dress her. Milli set a circlet of fresh white roses with a shoulder-length pouf of illusion around a pile of soft curls on top of Mamie’s head. Jane applied makeup and Julie helped fasten her skirt and jacket. “I know now why they have flowers at weddings,” Mamie said nervously.&quot;[Brown, Carolyn *Getting Lucky*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Around and around, waltzes, tangos, perfect delight. You could scarcely hear the music over the roar of the skates. Lottie left the rink with a skinned knee and feeling ten years younger. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that better than a museum?&quot;&quot;It was wonderful. &quot;She pulled him close to her and kissed the brown mole on bis neck. He said &quot;Hey. &quot;And then: &quot;I&#x27;ve got to go to the hospital now. &#x27;&quot;Already?&quot;&quot;What do you mean already?&quot;[Disch, Thomas M. *334*. Vintage, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;“Pound ‘em on the head, stay out of the poison oak, and run like hell when Aiffe shows up. One slick game plan. ” Farrell had come to the meeting in League dress—tights, tunic and a laced vest that Julie had made for him—like everyone else except Hamid, who had arrived directly from his post office job, wearing tan slacks, a white short-sleeved shirt, and—in spite of the heat—a narrow red tie, elegant as a serpent. Passers-by turned completely around to stare at them as they walked down through the sweetly smothering night.&quot;[Beagle, Peter S. *The Folk of the Air*. 1986.]</li>
<li>&quot;All around are beautiful golf courses, well-maintained beaches and nature that has been tamed and manicured. Celine ends the song. She lets the applause wash over her, then tells the people, &quot;I feel so wonderful being home with you tonight. &quot;Her voice is like velvet. Her words and the texture of her voice are like a lover fulfilled. The Coral Sky Amphitheater goes crazy. An electric charge rushes between Celine and the crowd. The show is going to be fabulous —pure pleasure. But there&#x27;s always a danger that if an audience is conquered too soon, it can feel disappointed or neglected.&quot;[Germain, Georges-Herbert *Celine: The Authorized Biography*. Dundurn, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;Lee took off all her layers except one black vest that clung to her small breasts. We shared a glass of iced water and I offered Lee the last splash from my mouth, but she danced around me and laughed and wouldn&#x27;t take it. Up on the balcony over the dance floor, I sat on the edge and leaned out to see the whirling scene. Lee fitted her hand around my thigh, weighing it down. &quot;You protecting me from falling?&quot;I asked. My voice was meant to be sardonic, but it came out more like breathless. &quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; she said.&quot;[Donoghue, Emma *Touchy Subjects*. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;The sun was setting and turned the school’s pink façade a blazing molten liquid color. At the same time, rainclouds were gathering over part of the sky. The sunflowers glowed in the golden light, standing out with superfine clarity against the blackening clouds. Someone had built a bonfire. Margit gave me a match. Everyone held hands around the fire and sang a song about beautiful blue eyes. At the one line about black eyes, Margit, who had black eyes like me, took my hand and sang with extra energy.&quot;[Batuman, Elif *The Idiot*. Penguin Press, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;So I started traveling around, playing around the South. It was one of the hardest audiences. Guys must play really good because for these people you can’t play less. They’ll recognize this. They hear it all the time. We played in bars on top of the platform, and it was really hot and the fans wanted more and more. Cats used to jump on the guitar, and there used to be cats playing behind their heads or playing with their teeth or elbows.&quot;[Hendrix, Jimi *Starting At Zero: His Own Story*. Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;I tried dancing a little bit, but mostly I just had to stand there and stare and stare, as one girl in black leather did James Brown steps, while Ari Up of the Slits, in all sorts of rags and a fishnet shawl, hopped highfooting around the dancefloor like some mix of spider and strutting ostrich, and the drummer from the Lous first walked around the floor on her knees, then got down on all fours and walked the dog for real as my eyeballs and then brain fell out a little at a time.&quot;[Bangs, Lester, and Greil Marcus (editor) *Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung: The Work of a Legendary Critic: Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Roll as Literature and Literature as Rock &#x27;N&#x27;Roll*.

<li>&quot;Marijuana plants, for example, could be clearly seen in the photographic tableau on the Sgt. Pepper cover—real pot plants, daringly placed in plain sight at the Beatles’ feet, or so the counselors said. One night they brought the cover around for inspection. We each had a turn with it. The infamous tableau was as densely woven as a tapestry; it was hard to know where to look. Under the big blue Northern England sky, tiers of cutout faces, cloth figures, waxworks, ferns, potted palms, garden ornaments, and sculptural busts were arrayed around the flesh and blood Beatles, who, tiger bright in military-band regalia and holding brass and wind instruments instead of electric guitars, stood poker-faced behind a circusy Lonely Hearts Club Band drum skin.&quot;[Rowlands, Penelope *The Beatles Are Here!: 50 Years after the Band Arrived in America, Writers, Musicians &amp; Other Fans Remember*.

<li>&quot;Sputnik and I walked around the base of the lighthouse and out to the deck. “Hel o, Janet,” that deep, intense voice echoed out of the mist. “Esmerelda?” “’Tis I. ” As I crossed the deck Esmerelda came into focus, sitting on a bench. She was around sixty and her face was framed with an exploding mass of gray hair that looked like a giant fur bal ; she had huge dark eyes lined in kohl and a feathery tattoo that fanned across her forehead. She was smoking a thin brown cigarette, and wearing flip-flops, tight black toreador pants, and a very low-cut maroon velvet blouse that revealed the top of the most amazing cleavage I’ve ever seen.&quot;[Stuart, Sebastian *To The Manor Dead*. Midnight Ink, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;But then more lit up, and still more, until a whole constellation surged around us like a million green twinkling stars, lighting our bodies, reflecting in our masks. Emma held out a hand and flicked her wrist, but rather than producing a ball of fire her hand glowed a scintillating blue. The green stars coalesced around it, flashing and whirling, echoing her movements like a school of fish, which, I realized, is just what they were. Mesmerized, I lost all track of time. We stayed there for what seemed like hours, though it was probably only a few minutes.&quot;[Riggs, Ransom *Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children*. Quirk Books, 2011.]</li>
