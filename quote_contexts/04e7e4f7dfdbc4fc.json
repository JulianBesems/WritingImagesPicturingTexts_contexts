To block out an undesirable view, use a stained glass panel the size of the window; to focus attention on the view, select a rectangular or curved stained glass frame around clear glass. Clear glass mixed at random with colored glass in a single panel gives a feeling of depth. Dramatic window accents can be beautiful, but if too much light enters a room, furnishings can take a beating.", "suggested_query": "As the frame encloses the glass, it also contains the gaze, directing it towards the exterior and, in turn, towards the viewer. This containment, this framing, subtly transforms the view, inflecting it with a sense of separation, of boundary. And yet, this boundary is not impermeable; the view, though framed, is still susceptible to the play of light and shadow, to the whispers of the outside world.", "suggest_context": "In all of this the window serves as the prop for discovering new and unexpected relationships between the inside and outside. This window, like any other, relies on mechanisms of operation, instruments of opening and closure. Fundamentally, glass is hard, yet fragile and brittle. The polished surface receives the gaze and, through its invisibility, reects eeting glimpses of the other, much like a mirror. Even with perfectly clear glass, the extent of this view is bounded because most glass panels require a frame."}
