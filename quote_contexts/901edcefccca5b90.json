The top 20 indices for each topic often form a narrative, weaving together the threads of meaning and association. For instance, in the case of beauty, the presence of words like \"silicone\" and \"reliquary\" suggests a connection to the artificial and the sacred, respectively. Meanwhile, the antithesis of beauty, featuring words like \"necrophilia\" and \"satanism\", reveals a darker, more macabre undertone. This dichotomy between beauty and its antithesis serves as a poignant reminder of the complex, multifaceted nature of human experience.", "suggest_context": "text rightarrow text Now for the internal figurative domain projection wfF rightarrow wfF, again using playground as the search index yields: skate, skateboard, seesaw, neighbourhood, placed, disadvantaged, area, sneaker, custody, backpack, chalking, neighborhood, graffiti, outreach, placing, vandalism, skating, distributing, handstand, relocation, donate, basketball, hydrant, converse, location, housing, complex, footlocker, township Figure 3.5:2 - Projection of playground onto the figurative multi-modal screen click to open full scale image. text rightarrow text Now that the internal projections have been established, we will look at the cross-modal projections. First f: wtF rightarrow wfF, with as index playground : credited, neighbor, bullied, substitute, toxic, goodwill, reverse, mortgaged, mi, teenage, differentiation, goofed, puberty, purchase, homey, townsman, four, copying, selection, bully, address, respectful, lunacy, inventor, parakeet, bogey, immature, cleanest, revert, punctilious Figure 3.5:2 - Projection of playground onto the figurative multi-modal screen click to open full scale image. This projection can best be understood as the figurative aspects in scenes amongst which one might have a conversation about playgrounds. If we compare this to the internal figurative projection, we see an overlap of the primary activated peak of the screen, but differences between the secondary nuances. This demonstrates both that the overall multi-modal cast has been calibrated to a degree that affords a level consistency between textual and figurative concepts, but at the same time also showing the way in which the figurative and textual indices are distinct from one-another. What is interesting in this particular case, is that the figurative playground does not present itself amongst the 20 top figurative contents relevant to conversations about playgrounds. In other cases this does occur, for instance umbrella surrounds itself with its figurative counterpart first: umbrella, downpour, warmhearted, raining, rainy, touching, maintains, upbringing, unbleached, sentimental, solidifying, rainwater, richness, nostalgic, rained, quaint, kindhearted, drizzle, rain, heartbreaking . These are in both cases of course quite tangible nouns, so let's have a look at something less tangible topic of converstaion like beauty : silicone, detox, reliquary, unraveling, malnourished, unraveled, hermaphrodite, ratify, dona, mausoleum, holy, bronze, necrophilia, satanism, slaying, sinning, deceased, titian, renaissance, trachea , which interestingly shows up in the background of its antithesis, at least things that are usually not regarded as beautiful at all, but either the loss thereof, or the attempt to mitigate the loss of beauty. Another interesting conversation is that of night : caressed, intertwining, sensuous, velvety, nuzzling, sensual, stimulating, kiss, caress, seductive, intimacy, kissing, humidity, abstract, seductress, kissed, fingering, tonguing, seducing, seduced , in which case the connection is more obvious, where the visual indices build up a clear genre of intimite scene in which one might expect to be speaking of the night. Of course we now only discuss the top 20 indices that present themselves as the primary context, but we will engage with the SOM screen and how it can offer us a means to speak of different types of scenes for the same topic in the next chapter 4.6."}
