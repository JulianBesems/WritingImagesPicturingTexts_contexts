    <pre>In discussing the character of ornament, in order to then debate a sense of an operative digital ornament, I will start by discussing the surface, as both the primary substrate or even condition for ornamentation, as well as a characterisation that might be perceived onto ornament superficial, but which I will try to surpass and turn into operation. So, starting with the ornamental surface, or the superficial ornament.

<em>In considering the ornamental surface, we find it already marked by the presence of ornament, as if the very surface itself has become a site of ornamentation, and thus the question arises as to whether the surface can be seen as ornament, or if it is merely the condition for ornament to operate. The surface, in other words, appears to be both the foundation and the ornament itself, a tension that will be crucial to my argument regarding the operative digital ornament.</em></pre>

As already demonstrated, the principle of surface ornamentation arises  from the basic idea of the surface as such and accordingly reaffirms it.

<li>&quot;Many even display accurate knowledge of the location and functioning  of the muscles under the skin, so that the muscles and their actions are represented on the surface of the skin pictorially or rather graphically using systems of lines—a very remarkable phenomenon that demonstrates they have  grasped and correctly understood ornament in its structural and symbolic  sense. Does this justify the conclusion that this conception of ornament is the  most original?Or should it rather appear to be a sign of a secondary cultural  condition of the people among whom it occurs?&quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Does human skin (both literal and displaced by the tropes aforementioned) in these images act as decoration or cladding?Is “blackness” ornament or essence?And what would it mean for “ornament” to acquire or require “essence” and vice versa?To ask these questions is already to acknowledge skin’s potential for surrogacy. The onlooker, for instance, might begin to observe how the lighting and the mise-en-scène work to conﬂate the different registers of surface planes. Thus Baker’s black, airbrushed, and seemingly ﬂawless THE WOMAN WITH THE GOLDEN SKIN 111 skin—greased and polished to a shiny, laminated gloss— ﬁnds an echo in her sleek, metallicized hair that, in turn, recovers itself in the lamé cloth pouring out of her body.&quot;[Cheng, Anne Anlin *Second Skin: Josephine Baker &amp; the Modern Surface*. Oxford University Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Skin in Imperiale’s account is not a surface hiding interiority but rather a complexly layered organ with its own interiority. Imperiale dissects the notion of skin as a simple surface, arguing, “In its very nature a surface is in an unstable condition. ” What are the boundaries of surface?Is surface both exterior and interior?Imperiale’s essay describes emerging practices in digital geospatial and imaging techniques that engage with the way imaging intersects with the physical body in complex, rich ways.&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Paradigms of depth ontology, what is beneath the beguiling but unreliable surface, the mere appearance of things, pervade western traditions. (cf Wigley 1996). Strathern&#x27;s paper on self-decoration shows that, for Hageners, the skin is where social relations are. The skin of the human body is decorated with paint, feathers, leaves. Social efficacy is, in contrast to western culture, on the surface. Strathern and Strathern, like &#x27;O&#x27;Hanlon, finding little 40 constancy in colour symbolism, conclude that dullness and glossiness, or brightness, are of more import than that of individual hues.&quot;[Young, Diane Jane Barbara *The Colours of Things: Memory, Materiality and an Anthropology of the Senses in North Western South Australia*. University College London, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;Artifacts, the products of engineering, do replace artifacts. However, the rhetoric of technology by which those artifacts are articulated in timber or stone or steel or any material, pure or composite, is more or less a constant of history. But since the actual process of engineering is elusive, becoming tangible only by being embodied in the artifact, the process of engineering itself can seem almost ineffable. Nevertheless, by looking at the continuity of artifacts and at the evolution of the use of materials, we can begin to appreciate what it is that is behind the technological environment.&quot;[Petroski, Henry *The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance*. Alfred A. Knopf, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;On the other hand, red-ness is the materiality of memory, in the kula shells whose surface becomes reddened with handling and thus gains both age and fame (Campbell 1983; Rowlands 1993). Colour, explicitly valued as surface, seems to be commonest though as body decorations, notably in Melanesia (Strathem and Strathem 1971, M Strathern 1979, &#x27;0&#x27; Hanlon 1989). In western culture colour is seen as surface, a mere superficial adjunct to the more substantial form or, in drawing and painting, line: &#x27;designo et colore&#x27;.&quot;[Young, Diane Jane Barbara *The Colours of Things: Memory, Materiality and an Anthropology of the Senses in North Western South Australia*.

<li>&quot;Whether or not the reader agrees with my conclusions, or whether or not he cares for my types, is im. . , material; they are at any rate the results of long experience and serious study. What, then, is original type design?Is it possible for an artist to design an original face of type?Probably not, in the strictest sense of the words, since, after all, what we call an &quot;original type face&quot; is undoubtedly little more than a subtle variation of an orthodox or traditional letter form, a form to which we attempt to impart a charm of charaCter or a quality of per. . , sonality-our efforts sometimes achieving a measure of un, conscious originality.&quot;[Goudy, Frederic W. *Typologia: Studies in Type Design and Type Making*.

<li>&quot;Is this room or womb designed to wrap around or stand in for the body?And what do we do with those furs anyway?Are they skin or hide?Cladding or decoration?Lush or raw?28 SECOND SKIN And here we come to the central conundrum in Loos’s theoretical work: when it comes down to it, what distinguishes cladding from ornamentation?What is essence and what is auxiliary?The divide between covering and ornamentation, between intellectual form and degenerate eroticism, turns out to be neither simple nor stable for this sensual aesthete. 9 And the problem rests precisely on the idea of “skin” and its inherently complicated relation to essence versus surface.&quot;[Cheng, Anne Anlin *Second Skin: Josephine Baker &amp; the Modern Surface*. Oxford University Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Architects work with raw computational power to evolve “self-generating” architectural scenarios. This has led to a move away from the interest in smooth surfaces with an emphasis on the interaction of individual cellular elements. It is essential to note, however, that the smooth and the discrete are merely understood at the level of scale. This is especially the case in architecture. In a smooth model of skin, at the level of the glossy rendered image, the architecture is luminous, luscious, reflective, and absolutely seamless—just like bodies.&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Dermal anchoring differs from transdermal implants, however, in that implants are permanently embedded in the skin, and surface piercing, which uses a technique that is not appropriate for all skin types or body locations. Dermal anchoring can be done almost anywhere on the body since the jewelry is relatively small, but healing will differ based on body area. Locations such as between the eyes (to simulate the Hindu pottu), on the outside corner of the eye (as in a beauty mark), on the chest, and on the fingers (worn like a ring) are popular.&quot;[DeMello, Margo *Encyclopedia of Body Adornment*. Greenwood, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Influences which may have contributed to such a development are suggested by an examination of adzing and carving motives. Ornamental adzing in simple geometric patterns seems to have been the primitive form of wood decoration. Imitation of its technique as well as the use of its motives on the body is evident. The former is seen in the filling of spaces, ordinarily made solid in color, with parallel, oblique, zigzag or wavy lines ( Pl. III, 7, inset in eye band; xxi, B, b; XXXVI, insets in e and g; xxxv, inset barred teeth in f; xxx, d); in the use of the intersection of adzing lines to form the motive called kopito (Pl.&quot;[Handy, Willowdean Chatterson *Tattooing in the Marquesas*.

<li>&quot;Even within a particular art the special form or material chosen or available determines the result. is not so easily decorated as earthenware, hence Australians deserve credit for the accurate circles they draw on stone with opossum teeth. The quality of the stone is also significant: the Greek sculptors had fine Stone marble, much superior to anything accessible, in Mexico. CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 180 Plate 28: PREHISTORIC PAINTINGS.

<li>&quot;They provided the ‘desiring skin’ that would shield and protect. However, the scars remained. As French analyst Didier Anzieu argues, ‘skin shields the equilibrium of our internal functioning from exogenous disruptions’, Gabriel Koureas 183 but in its scars, ‘it preserves the marks of disruptions’. 104 It is exactly these scars that Lewis’s Tyronic mask, like a prosthetic skin, attempted to hide.&quot;[Brauer, Fae, and Anthea Callen (eds.) *Art, Sex and Eugenics: Corpus Delecti*. Ashgate, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, these authors have tended to see dressing essentially as a surface activity, a matter of representation; dress is treated as a form of material communication, a signal or symbol which ﬁts unproblematically on to the body. In so doing, they have tended to ignore the relationship that exists between dress and the dynamic potential of the body. Clothes are not made to be hung on a clothes line but rather to be worn on a live, moving body.&quot;[Andrewes, Janet *Bodywork: Dress As Cultural Tool (African Social Studies Series)*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;Every material has its own formal language, and no material can lay claim to the forms of another material for itself. Because forms have arisen out of the usability and mode of production of every material, they have developed with the material and out of the material. No material permits an intervention into its range of forms.&quot;[Loos, Adolf *Ornament and Crime*. Penguin Books Ltd, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;But while not impossible, the author is unaware of any surviving examples of dō made using such materials, which would lack the resilience needed to be an effective protective material, despite their aesthetic appeal. By contrast, however, exotic materials like shark skin (same-gawa) were sometimes used in armour construction, though same-gawa was utilized as a covering for armour plating and not as the primary protective material. As the example of shark skin demonstrates, unusual characteristics should not be misinterpreted, for while they may be unique, the feature itself may not override the identifiable base form in which the cuirass has been constructed.&quot;[Absolon, Trevor *Samurai Armour, Volume I: The Japanese Cuirass*. Bloomsbury, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;with a specific location), and once in the sense of the &quot;offering&quot; placed on its surface. To sum up this section on the nature of codices, I turn to a final set of terms relating to codex scribes and the compositions they create. Here again, the similarities in meaning are nearly as striking as the similarities in form: taa, &quot;to write&quot;; taa, &quot;to weave or braid&quot;; yaa, &quot;(musical) performance&quot;; ndaa, &quot;to have a design/writing on something&quot;; and naa, &quot;type of drawn figure. &quot;&quot;[Boone, Elizabeth Hill, and Walter D.

<li>&quot;Illustration by Paul Hambruch. Reprinted from Paul Hambruch and Anneliese Eilers, Ponape: Gesellschaft und Geistige Kultur, Wirtschaft und Stoffliche Kultur (Hamburg: Friedrichsen, De Gruyter, 1936), 2:277. 23. The design is formed by the interplay of light and dark, of clear skin and marked skin, of positive and negative. Both elements are necessary to create the pattern, which weaves ink and skin together to form a kind of living tapestry.&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*.

<li>&quot;It seems to suggest yet another body over and above the one more hidden than shown below, one whose main effect, being dependent upon the lower body’s every movement, lies in revealing a lozenge-shaped oval of that body in its naked state. Here, again, skin is seen at the price of ﬁgure. The nakedness revealing itself follows chance movements and cannot be pre-arranged. By contrast, one can think of Versace, where every baring of skin is carefully framed and sexiness is set into action in a manner as dramatical as it is predictable.&quot;[Vinken, Barbara *Fashion Zeitgeist: Trends and Cycles in the Fashion System*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is a change that has forced designers to explore other approaches to design, to look at the ways that design can be used to communicate the purpose and the meaning of an object, rather than to treat design primarily as a question of solving mechanical and technical problems. There is, however, one area of design where the idea of objective analysis on the functional model has maintained its grip. To ask about how an object can be made and used in ways that will minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions has allowed a new generation to rediscover the moral certainty of functionalism.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*.

<li>&quot;This gorinto is usually constructed as follows: a square stone at the bottom represents the Earth Element, or stability and the fundamental element of being; next, a round stone represents the Water Element, or permeation and vacuity; a triangular stone represents the Fire Element, or purity and perfect activity; a crescent-shaped stone represents the Wind Element, or growth and perfect awareness; and, at the top, a stone in the shape of a mani-jewel (wish-fulfilling gem) represents the Void Element, or space.&quot;[Wilson, William Scott *The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi*.

<li>&quot;A beauty spot is considered particularly beguiling when it is situated near facial features that are already associated with beauty: at the corner of the eye or the mouth, or perched on a high, curving cheekbone, a beauty spot can accentuate and define facial allure. Like the dot that completes the downward stroke of an exclamation mark, a beauty spot magnifies the effect of fluttering eyelashes, a 80 O, No!It Is an Ever-fix’d Mark sensuous mouth, or the dewy smoothness of young skin. There is a point, however, where a beauty spot becomes a mole.&quot;[Cuskelly, Maryrose *Original Skin: Exploring the Marvels of the Human Hide*. Counterpoint, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Chalcedony is also sometimes described in terms of its color: blue chalcedony, pink chalcedony, and so on. Folklore, ancient documents, and the gem trade usually treat them separately, as we will here. However, only chalcedony is the correct scientific term to describe this kind of quartz. Distinctions between the various forms of chalcedony are largely subjective. In jewelry, “chalcedony” is usually applied to the light blue translucent and waxy form. The other main form of cryptocrystalline quartz is agate—the only difference between agate and chalcedony is that chalcedony is of a single color, while agates are banded in several different ways.&quot;[Morgan, Diane *Gemlore: Ancient Secrets and Modern Myths from the Stone Age to the Rock Age*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Exploring both evolving mirror forms and language allows us to trace the movement of different kinds of mirrors into North America and observe the varied uses for this object. From Metal to Glass Mirrors Since ancient times, Europeans had produced metal objects with reflective qualities. When craftsmen coated metal objects in molten tin to prevent rusting, they also produced a finished object with a reflective surface. This ancient practice was supplanted in the fourteenth century by tin-plating in which craftsmen coated thin sheets of iron or steel with tin before shaping the metal sheets into objects. 4 Both tinning and tin-plating produced a sheen on finished objects, including metal mirrors, similar to silver.&quot;[Shrum, Rebecca K. *In the Looking Glass: Mirrors and Identity in Early America*.
