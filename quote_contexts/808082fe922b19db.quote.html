    <pre>A certain kind of *unlimited* sits behind contemporary multimodal systems: oppositions and differences that are present everywhere, yet not necessarily brought into determinate relation. Something similar happens when a latent space becomes a general interior without thresholds. A full latent space being unlimited in what it can hold, but only navigatable if brought into a relationship with the input. In a way the state of latent space in ML, although fully governed by numbers, becomes without distance if abstracted away from the computational interaction. Everything becomes comparable and proportional to everything else. In heideggers words: “What is happening here when, as a result of the abolition of great distances, everything is equally far and equally near? What is this uniformity in which everydung is neither far nor near-is, as it were, without distance?” The ambition of the thesis, expressed through WIPTe is that the task is not to abolish that comparability, but to reintroduce distance as a practicable condition, so that one can actually enter the field rather than only sim it through similarity of iterated inputs.

      <li>&quot;The space so expressed is not one internal to a frame or closed system - such conceptions of space always lead us back to an image of a static or firmly bounded system, from which nothing escapes and in which everything is firmly anchored in place (contained in co-ordinates) and subject to illumination and observation (the erroneous dream of the panoptic state).

<li>&quot;Thus, “digital-space” is made commensurate with “real-space,” and not only physical axioms, but also metaphysical axioms are sustained, ensuring that the same epistemological system governing Western thought will continue to operate. For instance, there is the “Principle of Exclusion”—roughly equating to the law of identity—whereby two identical objects cannot share the same space at the same time. 1 8 The “Principle of Maximal Exclusion” ensures that a space will be designed that minimizes the violations of the Principle of Exclusion—that is, a space will be designed where objects have a place, a time, a trajectory of movement, etc.&quot;[Beckmann, John (ed.), and John Beckmann *Virtual Dimension: Architecture, Representation, and Crash Culture*.

<li>&quot;It bears reemphasis that, rightly or wrongly, our conviction of past presence in photographs is independent of being able to recognize or identify space in the image. If mimesis there be in photography, it is not spatial. Rather, it is the confounding perception that things absent in time can be present in space. Think of the puzzling image of the “duck-rabbit,” evoked by Wittgenstein and others—this is a paradox of spatial recognition, of identifying linguistically two contradictory things as being presented by the same space.&quot;[Rodowick, D. N. *The Virtual Life of Film*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;By this analogy, one can see the relationship between ordinary and hyper-real space in terms of the relationship between the closed, curved surface of the earth and threedimensional Cartesian space. Just as our life on the surface is finite yet unbounded, so is three-dimensional space finite and unbounded. We cannot perceive it as such because our senses are conditioned by the use of one dimension as a projective line (the sagittal), and this line must be included in four-dimensional space.&quot;[Perez-Gomez, Alberto, and Stephen Parcell *Chora 1: Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture*.

<li>&quot;Figure 2. 3:2 - 3D PCA reduced visualisation of ArchDaily and Ghibli image (blue) and text (red) pairs. Far from a neutral terrain, the shared latent space is geometrically shaped by the logic of contrastive alignment. Understanding this mechanism opens the door for alternative approaches. Rather than collapsing modalities into a common axis, an architectonic strategy might embrace this separation as a natural condition, one that supports difference, contextual framing, and multimodality. &quot;Aldo van Eyck has said: &quot;Architecture should be conceived of as a configuration of intermediary places clearly defined. This does not imply continual transition or endless postpone- ment with respect to place and occasion. On the contrary, it implies a break away from the contemporary concept (call it sickness) of spatial continuity and the tendency to erase every articulation between spaces, i. e. , between outside and inside, between one space and another (between one reality and another). &quot;11 115 &quot;[INPUT: content_small.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Martin Heidegger 117 Space—is it that which, since that time (Newton), challenges modern man increasingly and ever more obstinately to its utter control?Does not modern graphic art also follow this challenge in so far as it understands itself as dealing with space?Does it not thereby find itself confirmed in its modern character?Yet, can the physically-technologically projected space, however it may be determined henceforth, be held as the sole genuine space?Compared with it, are all other articulated spaces, artistic space, the space of everyday practice and commerce, only subjectively conditioned prefigurations and modifications of one objective cosmic space?&quot;[Leach, Neil *Rethinking Architecture: A Reader in Cultural Theory*. Routledge, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;There are thus relationships between language and space which are to a greater or lesser extent misconstrued or disregarded. There is doubtless no such thing as a “true space,” as once postulated by classical philosophy and indeed still postulated by that philosophy’s continuation, namely epistemology and the “scientific criteria” it promotes. But there is certainly such a thing as a “truth of space” which embodies the movement of critical theory without being reducible to it.&quot;[Hays, K. Michael *Architecture Theory since 1968*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;The number becomes a subject. The independence of the number in relation to space is a result not of abstraction but of the concrete nature of smooth space, which is occupied without being counted.&quot;[Hays, K. Michael *Architecture Theory since 1968*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;The Too Unbound dimension seems to involve feeling vulnerable and too exposed. It therefore seems to relate to exposing more of oneself than one feels comfortable with. Intercultural variation is pivotal here. Clearly, much remains to be explored in relation to the grammar of threedimensional space including one final dimension, its multisensory nature. The work presented in this chapter has only taken vision into account yet the experience of space involves all of the senses: sight, sound, smell and touch – and most of these are largely unexplored.&quot;[Edited by Shoshana Dreyfus, Maree Stenglin, and Susan Hood *Semiotic Margins: Meaning in Multimodalites*. Continuum, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Second, this change of dimension may be qualitative and absolute. Like the proverbial straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back, at some point an increase or diminution of quantity will pass a threshold and bring about a qualitative, irreversible change of state. This is how Eisenstein envisions the close-up, as a turning point, a threshold, a point of qualitative transformation. In as much as it dislocates, it also opens up a new kind of dimensionality and a new kind of space - namely, a transformation space: a space of possibilities between the state of the before and the state of the after.&quot;[O’Connor, Daniel M. *Mediated Associations: Cinematic Dimensions of Social Theory*. McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Though technically operating within the same space, they navigate as if they 164 b ri an w. ch ane n were in a more smooth space. As Nunes says, referring again to the ideas of Deleuze and Guattari, “smooth space sets up a nomadic system of movement,” where “lines become vectors, rather than units of measurement” (64). This tension between striated and smooth space, between movement on a grid or network and nomadic wandering in a free space, is the inherent tension of digital space and the binary opposition—presented using the very same vocabulary—that runs throughout Against the Day.&quot;[Herzogenrath, Bernd *Travels in Intermediality: ReBlurring the Boundaries*. Dartmouth, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;The space that is thus made by positions is space of a peculiar sort. As distance or ‘stadion’ it is what the same word, stadion, means in Latin, a spatium, an intervening space or interval. Thus nearness and remoteness between men and things can become mere distance, mere intervals of intervening space. In a space that is represented purely as spatium, the bridge now appears as a mere something at some position, which can be occupied at any time by something else or replaced by a mere marker.&quot;[Leach, Neil *Rethinking Architecture: A Reader in Cultural Theory*. Routledge, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;Topology becomes more relevant than geometry: the latter has to do with measurements and locations in an external system of reference, while the former disregards measurement and deals only with the structure of space qua space. Figures and shapes are not placed in space; they constitute spaces in/of their own. As Arkady Plotnitsky (2009, 203) argues, “this view radically transforms our philosophy of space and matter, and of their relationships, by leading to a horizontal rather than vertical (hierarchical) science of space as a ‘typology and topology of manifolds,’ which Deleuze and Guattari associate with the end of dialectic and extend to spaces that are philosophical, aesthetic, cultural, or political. ” Such can be the powerful consequences of a topological understanding of transduction, leading to a non-Euclidean mode of thought—enabling individuations to become space-surfaces of potentially infinite dimensions, and liberating relationships from any form of transcendental determination.&quot;[Schwab, Michael *Transpositions: Aesthetico-Epistemic Operators in Artistic Research*. Leuven University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;For the relational unity that takes place between what is being used and who or what is using it are never wholly separable—there is no recourse to a separate (prior) realm. I’ve crossed a threshold and gone from one space to another. I have spoken of rooms, but the space I’m in now is bigger and more open than any room I’ve ever known. In this space (should I call it a landscape?)using is taking place as not using up, subject and object have become deactivated along with instrumental and utilitarian use, and nothing prior is left behind in a separate realm.&quot;[Schwab, Michael *Transpositions: Aesthetico-Epistemic Operators in Artistic Research*. Leuven University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;Something of it can already be glimpsed in the work of J. J. Gibson. On demand of the U. S. Air Force during World War II, he conducted neuro-psychological experiments on dive-bomber pilots having orientational problems as they approached the earth at high speeds. Gibson’s conclusion was to leave behind our traditional (Kantian) notion of space and to conceive of it instead as a succession of vistas producing a discontinuous space. AR: That’s the transition from three-dimensional to sequential space.&quot;[Beckmann, John (ed.), and John Beckmann *Virtual Dimension: Architecture, Representation, and Crash Culture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;We see the contraction of two concepts: equally grounded on the earth, equally constructed as a building might be. The space the rift opens or closes is present as a space marking the contraction. It can be read through Heidegger’s notions of space in ‘Building, Dwelling, Thinking’ and the notion of circumspective space elaborated in Being and Time. The rift is not a mere sketch, but a space that opens up in the collapse of a distance. It is also open to the dynamism the Kantian schema carries in its temporal facet.&quot;[Zdebik, Jakub *Deleuze and the Diagram: Aesthetic Threads in Visual Organization*. London: Continuum, 2012.]</li>

The separation of message and ture begins where space ends, they mean messenger introduces the discourse of exactly that: contemporary architecture nonlocation. Until this historic moment begins beyond the historical physically each (immaterial) message needed a experienced space. Daniel Libeskind too (physical) messenger who transmitted, denies the historical term of location or transported, or displaced it from one space in architecture as already suggested place to another.&quot;[Betsky, Aaron, Ole Bouman, David Deutsch, Elizabeth Diller Ricardo Scofidio, Monika Fleischmann Wolfgang Strauss, Sulan Kolatan William Mac Donald, and William J.

<li>&quot;Navigation is not just about the movement through a space, it is about the architecture, visual appearance, and usability of that space. On the other hand, the scope of Winograd’s deﬁnition is wide open (as one of the discussants on ChiPlace pointed out). A space can mean anything from a bus stop to a shopping mall to cyberspace. In trying to illustrate the similarity between real-world navigation and navigation in information space, Benyon described how unstable some physical spaces can be.&quot;[Imaz, Manuel, and David Benyon *Designing with Blends: Conceptual Foundations of Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering*.

<li>&quot;neither true nor false) because it describes a possible world in the past that cannot obtain. In contrast, from a mental-spaces perspective, truth is measured only by the mental space in which the proposition occurs, making no distinction between real world and hypothetical worlds. In example (2), relevant correlations are mirrored within parallel spaces: one in the Here-and-Now (i. e. the real world in current time and space) and the other in a hypothetical space. Both spaces relate the speaker to their conduct at school and then to their job outcomes.&quot;[(Eds.), Grant Malcolm *Multidisciplinary Approaches to Visual Representations and Interpretations*.

<li>&quot;It suddenly appears in the centre of indetermination, that is to say in a subject. . . . There is therefore a relation between affection and movement in general. . . . But it is precisely in affection that the movement ceases. 29 For Deleuze, affect is still ﬁrmly inscribed in the relationship between viewer and image, it is the parenthesis, the affective parenthesis, through which a space— “any-space-whatever”30—opens up, an emptied, detached space, neither geometric nor geographic nor social in any strict sense.&quot;[Veigl, Thomas, and Oliver Grau *Imagery in the 21st century*. Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Situated next to the constructed and resourced, functional space, the emptiness of a barren lot will offer both a relief and a promise. At the closing of this chapter, I stand at a curious juncture; one that is unlike the start but unlike an end. In frustration, I tend to think that this is the nature of the work: To live in “horizons of (im)possibilities” and create a discussion that does not choke interpretability nor—like superfluous urban space—discipline particular subjectivities. It is now clearer than ever: those spaces, these (pseudo) endings, we need.&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*. Springer Netherlands, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Together they draw a diagram of an unlimited deframable space of possible inflection prior to the delimited space of fixed objects and images. It is a space where new complicating movement is always arising: the space in which the Earth moves. For what the potential of inflection and deframing in our images means is this: that the Earth must move, and that the movements of the Earth are none other than the release of this movement prior to representation and determinate wholes, to fixed coordinates or gravitational vectors.&quot;[Cache, Bernard *Earth Moves: The Furnishing of Territories (Writing Architecture)*. The MIT Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;I suggest that these general vs. extreme boundaries are consistent with &quot;inside&quot; vs. &quot;outside&quot; their gestural &quot;F-space&quot;, and when a gesture is made within (or outside) F-space, the speaker is conveying additional but relevant information about information focus and navigating mental space. 7 As will become evident in the next section, gestures within F-space are relevant to &quot;Here&quot; or &quot;Me&quot; (i. e.&quot;[(Eds.), Grant Malcolm *Multidisciplinary Approaches to Visual Representations and Interpretations*.

<li>&quot;A topological space of genres is then simply one in which each genre is characterised as being either nearer or more distant from other genres along a number of dimensions of comparison. Clearly, two genres might simultaneously be close along one dimension of comparison, while remaining distant along another. The dimensions of comparison give the dimensions of the genre space. This is straightforward to represent in two and three dimensions, since we can rely on our natural capabilities for imagining and perceiving everyday space; for higher number of dimensions of simultaneous comparison, intuitive visualisation is difficult although the general principle should still be clear.&quot;[Bateman, John *Analysing Multimodal Documents: A Foundation for the Systematic Analysis of Multimodal Documents*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Painting can bring merely to sight what is rightfully out of sight. It can displace and collapse space. Its space is neither the immediate space of the present nor the distant space of the absent. Painting, in a sense, fits into no space and belongs to no one place. The ambivalence toward painting has as much to do with its irreducibility to either presence or absence, life or death, as it does to the cause of the confoundment: mimesis. Plato, Derrida tells us, “is obliged sometimes to condemn mimesis in itself as a process of duplication, whatever its model might be, and sometimes to disqualify mimesis only in function of the model that is ‘imitated,’ the mimetic operation in itself remaining neutral, or even advisable.&quot;[Ameri, Amir H *The Architecture of the Illusive Distance*.
