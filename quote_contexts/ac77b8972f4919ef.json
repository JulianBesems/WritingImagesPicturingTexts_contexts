It is as if the walls themselves are whispering secrets to the furniture, and the furniture is listening intently, its shape and texture subtly shifting in response. The result is a sense of harmony and balance that is hard to achieve with a fixed colour scheme.", "suggest_context": "The fact that the colour on the walls alters when a cloud passes over the sun and looks different throughout the day or even across the seasons is what makes the paint feel alive.
