The profession has excelled at the first (the tangible model and its deliverables), while the second (abstraction as mediating intelligence) remains under-instrumentalised in computational practice. The challenge, then, is not to abandon the body of architecture but to recover its disembodied capacities as operations that relate unlike domains such as drawing, narrative, atmosphere, code, without collapsing them into sameness. Therefore the thinking of architectural modes of media is proposed to be brought into the computational before we can consider how it can be returned onto architecture itself. In contrast to the computational model in architecture, In digital contexts, \u201cspace\u201d need not be a three-dimensional container at all, but an n-dimensional arrangement of features where relations are learned as proximities and projections. The crucial step is the encoding that makes such spaces operable, an encoding that can (and will argue should) include cultural and contextual signals beyond 3D material geometry."}
