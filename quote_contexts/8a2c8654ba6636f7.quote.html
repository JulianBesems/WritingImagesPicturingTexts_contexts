      <li>&quot;*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&amp;annotation=WA8NIH6S)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The context shapes the resources available for meaning making and how these are selected and designed.* — **Check article by xy? In coding** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=269&amp;annotation=RVVZVLII)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Lemke noted (2002: 303) ‘No [written] text is an image. No text or visual representation means in all and only the same ways that text can mean. It is this essential incommensurability that enables genuine new meanings to be made from the combinations of modalities’.* — **-this is exactly the right way of putting it compared to earlier sentence** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=272&amp;annotation=KAHF5HK6)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The interac-tion between modes is itself a part of the production of meaning.* — **!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=269&amp;annotation=3Y7VZBZB)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Thus the interaction between modes is significant for meaning making.* [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=268&amp;annotation=3TX4L987)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*From paint­ ing to image, from image to text, from text to voice, a sort of imaginary pointer indicates, shows, fixes, locates, impose s a syste m of references, tries to sta­ bilize a unique space* — **How might we go about this in a digital context where description and image collapse?** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=42&amp;annotation=Z28V8UDG)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*There is a large body of multimodal research that explores the dynamics of the interaction between image and language.* — **Interesting but to me it seems to fall into the same pitfalls where meaning is seen as a singularly defined unifying mapping of the modalities. However this fails to acknowledge that the modalities need to remain in their domain to bear this meaning. This collapsing them and studying them by means of analysing meaning seems odd to me. However further and closer reading is needed.

Primary argument is that our approach is an active one where it navigates domains to put something forward which inherently relies on a different approach where this research is employing an analytical method to study how understanding is derived from multimodal sources . (Analysis vs Algebra?)** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=275&amp;annotation=7RJ5TVJQ)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*This materiality has important semiotic potentials in itself: sound has different affordances from written inscription, while gesture offers different material potentials from colour, and so on* [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=271&amp;annotation=CEKLM2DJ)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Under the guise of reverting to a previous arrangement, it recovers its three functions-but in order to pervert them, there­ by disturbing all the traditional bonds oflanguage and the image.* — **This exactly expresses how text and image cannot in all situations be expressed in the same encoding. Because this subversion is only possible because image and text stand to each others proportion but not in one another&#x27;s encoding.** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=34&amp;annotation=SDLNYAT5)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*multimodality investigates the interaction between communicational means and challenges the prior predominance of spoken and written language in research* — **Odd, might be interesting but it is a little strange to me that in relation to semiotics it disregards the role of language** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=267&amp;annotation=G86UTSE5)&quot;</li>
