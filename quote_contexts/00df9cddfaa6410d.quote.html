    <pre>4.1.1 FLOOR

<em>The FLOOR function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number. For example, FLOOR(3.14) returns 3, while FLOOR(-2.5) returns -3. The FLOOR function is often used in combination with the ROUND function to achieve different rounding effects. For instance, ROUND(3.14, 0) returns 3, but FLOOR(3.14, 0) returns 3 as well.</em></pre>
