Selected: For example, a marble runner within a wooden floor could form a ‘pathway’ through a hall and into a living space, perhaps continuing to the fireplace or window; or in a kitchen, dark wood set into a poured-resin floor could be echoed by a worktop or cabinets of the same wood. One of the joys of introducing contrasting runners is that it allows you to use luxury materials that in large quantities would blow the budget.[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]

01. "The walls are a large “plane. ” The sofa is a large “plane. ” The floor coverings and floor are large planes. My apartment might be a fun example to analyze . . . Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor. The walls pull from the white in the floor—a quiet “plane” in contrast with the “pop” of the painted floors."[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy & broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*. Skyhorse Publishing, 2016.]

02. "2. 1. Structure To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. In primitive buildings, the ground may be used as the floor. In better buildings, the floor may be a deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist indicated in Fig."[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]

03. "In such cases, horizontal structural members, called beams, have to be provided to carry the weight of the deck and the loads on it to the vertical supports. Figure 2. 2 illustrates two of many types of floor construction in use. Figure 2. 2a shows a floor system often used in houses. The plywood sub floor is covered with carpeting. On the underside, the sub floor is supported on Electrical Systems In most buildings, electric equipment and wiring are provided to bring electric power into the interior and distribute the power where needed, for lighting, heating, operating motors, control systems and electronic equipment."[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

07. "The constructional technique for flooring to non-serviced areas comprises decking units or joists and blockwork sleeper walls to save the cost of pedestals and trays. Far more important are the related floor levels for lobbies, stairs and communal service areas such as lavatories, kitchens and door thresholds. Shallow and deep raised floor systems are used to provide different degrees of accessibility."[Blanc, Alan *Internal Components*. Routledge, 1994.]

08. "Sloping terrain often generates a design solution with staggered floor levels. On occasion, in the renovation of older buildings, particularly those with low or constraining ceiling heights, floor levels will be adjusted to open up spaces. There is also the occasional need to join two adjacent buildings with unaligned floor levels. Buildings with intermediate floor levels have the potential for creating visually exciting spaces and vistas."[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]

09. "In practice, ground-floor joists are often half the depth of those used in upper floors where, of course, such intermediate support is not possible. The plan (previous page) shows the ground-floor layout of a typical late-Victorian terraced house. The joists run from side to side (front to back is another option) and are supported on sleeper walls. The joists in the front room, therefore, are supported by the party walls, the sleeper wall and the internal loadbearing wall."[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed. Estates Gazette Ltd, 2006.]

10. "Exceptions to this would be rooms below ground level where damp could damage the timber, rooms which were likely to be wet due to their function, eg kitchens and sculleries, and some working class terraced housing built with clay block floors or stone flags. NB For more information on timber see Chapter 11- Timber-Frame Housing. The floor (often referred to as a raised timber floor or suspended floor) consists of a series of joists supported by the loadbearing walls and covered with floorboards."[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed. Estates Gazette Ltd, 2006.]

11. "Shallow floors are suitable for lightweight use only and can take normal general office loading of 2. 5 kN/m2 ; heavy equipment, such as safes. large computers and bulk storage, need special consideration. The use of high-grade panels and jacks • a large proportion of the floor needs to be accessible; • services need to be routed across deep-plan buildings; • the floor void serves as a plenum for heating and ventilation."[Blanc, Alan *Internal Components*. Routledge, 1994.]

12. "Whenever a floor plan arrangement emerges in any stage of the planning process, some form of three-dimensional sketch, no matter how rough or tentative, can be useful. It is not necessary to debate here whether a solidly functional floor plan is more important than a visually satisfying space; both are crucial to well-designed and sustainable interiors."[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]

21. "The more challenging aspects of wet-room installation are making sure all the openings—from drains to water-supply inlets—are properly sealed with special membrane, and correctly sloping the floor to a central drain. Normally, a wet room floor is sloped from all four corners for this purpose, but you can opt for a sleeker look with the use of a concealed linear “trench” drain along one edge of the room."[Press, Editors of Cool Springs *Black & Decker Complete Guide to Bathrooms 5th Edition : Dazzling Upgrades & Hardworking Improvements You Can Do Yourself*. 5th ed.
