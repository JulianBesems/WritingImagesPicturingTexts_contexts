How they are proportioned, cast, and set into resonance by an instrument designed to work with abundance rather than to legislate it. Echoing this posture, whilst referencing Calasso, Riccardo Villa notes the epistemic upheaval that the digital introduces: Once it becomes digital, every form of knowledge does not simply stand but is always open to digitability.

PD12M is a large, license-clear collection of approximately 12.4 million public-domainCC0 images, hosted on cloud storage independent of original hosts. In addition to the images a standardised Parquet metadata database and precomputed CLIP Vit-L14 embeddings for every image are available, providing a ready-made vectorial substrate for later operations on the image field, of a magnitude that would otherwise be arduous to process on an individual laptop, primarily because of the 39TB of original image data required to be processed in order to make the embeddings from scratch. Crucially, we acknowledge and accept the lack of any further contextual information to the images, this aligns with our intent of treating the images as imagery only, not as documents. While the PD12M dataset exposes a minimal source field an institutional tag indicating the upstream collection, e.g., wikimedia, it does not provide per-image author, title, or other bibliographic identity fields, and we deliberately refrain from reconstructing these. This brackets questions of authorship and naming and keeps the image field epistemically distinct from the text field used elsewhere in the instrument, as it does not allow any form of association to the images based on associated textual information. Any operation on the dataset has to come from the figurative information of the IMAGE domain itself. For casting and proportion it is handled as a generic visual screen, an epistemically distinct field held in proportion to the TEXT domain. Although we do not engage with the authorship or further contextual information of the images, we do stress that we value that each ite\n\n*m is a unique contribution to the dataset, a singular instance of the public domain. Furthermore, the PD12M dataset is constantly evolving, with new images being added and others being removed, reflecting the dynamic nature of the public domain. This flux is not only a reflection of the ever-changing landscape of cultural and artistic production but also a testament to the instrument's ability to adapt and evolve in response to the shifting boundaries of what constitutes public domain imagery. As the instrument engages with this imagery, it must also contend with the implications of its own role in shaping and influencing the public domain, recognizing that its actions will have a ripple effect on the very fabric of this domain. By acknowledging and embracing this responsibility, the instrument can position itself as a facilitator of creative and intellectual exploration, rather than a controller of cultural heritage.*", "suggested_query": "m is a unique contribution to the dataset, a singular instance of the public domain.
