These features are then combined in various ways to generate a set of modalities that can be used to write this thesis. The model's performance is evaluated using a set of metrics that assess its ability to generate coherent and meaningful text. The results of this evaluation will be presented in chapter 4, where the model's performance will be compared to that of other models trained on different datasets.  The next section will describe the process of transforming the film scripts into features and the various methods that were used to evaluate the model's performance.", "suggest_context": "3.1 OUTLINE - The text editor operates in a multi-modal manner, constantly both personal and general. - There are different layers of private and public: the private construct of choices and curation facilitates the projection on the common sense - The Scales of the data differs. Therefore the role of the model is here interpreted as the curation and construction of the correlation between the modalities that are facilitated by a chosen set of multi-modal documents. The primary dataset for this is a selection of 215 films which are used as the primary model used to write this thesis. This chapter will describe how this model is constructed and how other modes can be used to establish other biases, which will be demonstrated in the writing of chapter 4."}
