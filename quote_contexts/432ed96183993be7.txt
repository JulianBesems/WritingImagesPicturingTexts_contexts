Selected: "Such spatial representation of spatial relationships is pictorial in a quite straightforward way. Few cases, however, are as simple as this. If the sentence were spoken instead of written, it would be a temporal relationship between sounds rather than a spatial relationship on the page which would represent the relationship between the cities. But this in turn is possible only because the spoken sequence and the spatial array have a certain abstract structure in common. According to the Tractatus, there must be something which any picture must have in common with what it depicts."[Kenny, Sir Anthony *An Illustrated Brief History of Western Philosophy*.

03. "If that sounds like it might be a bit dangerous in a 15th- century context, consider a hyper-modern example: the internet is based on the same philosophy—even though the servers are physically located in many different places, they link up together to create a virtual space which, to the user, seems like a single continuum. What does this tell us about ideas?I would like to claim that such a cartographic approach, and particularly Grothendieck's new reworking of this ancient idea, tells us that there is no single prefered point of view to any given question."[Grothendieck, Alexandre., Alexandre Grothendieck, and Leila  (eds.) Schneps *Alexandre Grothendieck: A Mathematical Portrait*. Bilingual. France., Peyresq, France): International Press of Boston, 2014.]

04. "This consequential relationship must, on the imagist view, be ‘observed’ or ‘perceived’ in the particular case and must therefore, presumably, be already present in the particular case, before the act of generalizing to all relevantly similar cases. If it were not already present there would be no way of distinguishing between necessarily related aspects and contingently related aspects of the particular case. That is to say, there would be no way of distinguishing the universalizable perception that this triangle has angles equal to two right angles from the non-universalizable perception that this triangle is red."[Ayers, Michael *Locke (Arguments of the Philosophers)*. New edition. Routledge, 1993.]

05. "If we talk of perceiving in several things the common feature redness, we should realize that there would be no such determinate and identifiable ‘feature’ or point of resemblance unless some word had the meaning which ‘red’ has. Hence we cannot appeal to the evident presence or absence of such an antecedently identified feature in a dispute over a borderline case: we have rather to appeal to a notion of what would properly be called ‘red’."[Ayers, Michael *Locke (Arguments of the Philosophers)*. New edition. Routledge, 1993.]

06. "This is not Aristotle’s own account of his difference from his predecessors: see 427a17 ff. 18 See e. g. Kahn (1979b). 19 Osborne (1983) takes a slightly different view of reﬂectiveness. 20 On consciousness in general, see e. g. Tye (1995); Lycan (1996); Papineau (2002). 21 There are obvious tricky cases: just how conscious am I of the smell of buttered toast while I am concentrating on writing this sentence?22 Here see the debate about spiritualism versus literalism, especially between Burnyeat (e. g."[McCabe, Mary Margaret *Platonic Conversations*. Hardcover. Oxford University Press, USA, 2015.]

07. "But the application of the substitu- tion test would involve a certain extension. We should have to ask whether or not the sentence was being used in such a way as to license the inference with regard to any particular individual (say, Socrates) who is known to be human that he is, however described, necessarily rational. The de re interpretation of universal, necessary sentences in Aristotle would take them as licensing this inference; the analytic interpretation would not. Again, the de re interpretation would take the universal sentences to be best read in terms of the hyphenated predicate tnecessarily-rational', while the analytic interpretation would take them to be best read by making the modal word govern the whole sentence tall humans are rational'."[Sorabji, Richard *Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory*. 1983.]

09. "Many geographers would not agree with my opening statement. I would challenge them to disprove it or to make valid claims for other dimensions of the discipline. One could not support a contrary argument based on geography’s traditional role of collecting facts about the earth’s physical or human environment. While other aspects of the discipline continue to have much to offer in terms of understanding the relations between people and places, it is not always possible to differentiate the geographic/geospatial component from the more general humanities’, political sciences’, or social sciences’ thinking and reasoning that drives much of this work."[Fotheringham, A Stewart, and Peter A.

10. "As I am an art historian of the post-1945 period, this list of grids clearly falls beyond the scope of my specialization. I am well aware that certain debates, positions, and connections suggested by this list would be rendered more complex or subtle in the hands of an expert 7 8 in each ﬁeld. Such subtlety would have doubled the length of this project, however, bogging it down with technical details relished by the specialist but largely beside the point for the overall thrust of this interdisciplinary adventure tale."[Higgins, Hannah *The grid book*.

11.

15. "Our model would almost never see two occurrences of the same feature and would not be able to learn effectively. Therefore, we would like to turn raw text into a form that is more amenable to machine learning. There are numerous ways of dealing with text, and the field of natural language processing is dedicated to processing, representing, and modeling textual content. A full treatment is beyond the scope of this book, but we will introduce a simple and standard approach for text-feature extraction; this approach is known as the bag-of-words representation."[Pentreath, Nick *Machine Learning with Spark*.
