      <li>&quot;wall 2001 As thin as possible: fantasy of the  two-dimensional wall, sketched in 3D by  SANAA for the Kunstlinie Almere,  Netherlands. PAGE 3 WALL The meaning of the wall is just as diverse as the uses of vertical surface can be, but there are at least two essential  functions: providing structure and dividing space. The two can be separated, and thus the category of &#x27;wall&#x27; divides into  two: the bearing wall, separating roof from ground; and the partition wall, organizing movement within the resulting  container. The former, it would seem, is as stable as the human need for shelter; the latter as changeable as our forms  of sociability. &quot;[INPUT: wall.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Although designers usually provide structural depth to façades using ribbed or discrete elements, as in the previous example, continuous structure like an undulating wall presents other possibilities. If folded or curved in plan, the structural depth and the stability and strength normal to the plane of a wall increase. Such a wall can therefore be understood as a vertically cantilevered folded-plate when resisting face loads.&quot;[Charleson, Andrew *Structure As Architecture: A Source Book For Architects And Structural Engineers*. Architectural Press, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;In place of this a bonding transverse “wall” (itself of two faces and a core) can be built across the structure—obviously such a device is more proper to “engineering” structures, where special strength and stability is required (e. g. dams). It should be noticed also that this transverse bonding not only ties the wall together, but it also compartmentalises the core and thus reduces its outward pressure on the wall face (ABADY IV 1987 pp.&quot;[Wright, G.R.H. *Ancient Building Technology, Volume 3: Construction (2 vols.)*.

<li>&quot;PAGE 20 WOVEN WALL The ur-wall is not, according to  19th century architectural theorist  Gottfried Semper, a mud or stone  line of enormous and reassuring  heft, but an artful, woven partition.  Hanging loosely, perhaps flapping,  the woven screen generates-   and, crucially, symbolizes -   the division and organization of  activities within the primitive dwelling. The woven &quot;wall&quot; is an enabler  of civilization; the thick structural  wall merely a defender of it. &quot;[INPUT: wall.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;In the context of this chapter, shaping a wall in plan presents opportunities for architectural enrichment, as illustrated at the Mönchengladbach Museum. Highly regarded for the qualities of its interior spaces and urban setting, an exterior gallery wall undulates (Fig. 4. 10). The sinuous wall imbues one gallery interior with special character and outside, the wall’s serpentine geometry appears as a natural extension of the curvilinear paths and brick walls that lead up the hillside to the museum.&quot;[Charleson, Andrew *Structure As Architecture: A Source Book For Architects And Structural Engineers*.

<li>&quot;interior wall Any wall within a building; entirely surrounded by exterior walls. load-bearing wall A wall capable of supporting an imposed load in addition to its own weight. masonry wall A load-bearing or non-load-bearing wall consisting of hollow masonry units. non-load-bearing wall A wall subject only to its own weigh and wind pressure. partition An interior wall dividing a room or part of a building into separate areas; may be either non-load-bearing or load-bearing.&quot;[Ernest., Burden *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Yet, wall C integrates the remains of a remarkable, obviously even earlier structure (Wall C1), most of which had already been destroyed or dismantled when the construction of wall C was started. Here, we get a glimpse of the concepts of a medieval “building in the historical context”. 3. 2 Definition of structural criteria for masonry of wall C1 The question of when Wall C1 could have been built cannot be answered in Baku itself, since no directly comparable constructions or construction techniques have been discovered here so far.&quot;[Le Brun, Nicolas *Building knowledge, construction history. 2 vols.

<li>&quot;It should be noted that from limited excavations it is not necessarily clear whether the primary purpose of~ heavy wall at the crest of a slope is a defensive city wall or a retaining wall, a terrace wall (cf. Neolithic jericho v. Duj; pp. 66-67. EB Megiddo v. TA rg77, pp. 79 ff. ). In fact very often a wall must have served both 76, 78 URBAN FOR TIFICA TIONS-W ALLS 86 purposes-acting as a retaining wall in its lower parts and as a defensive wall above (cf.&quot;[Wright, G.R.H. *Ancient Building in South Syria and Palestine*. Leiden: Brill, 1985.]</li>
<li>&quot;The signiﬁcance of a wall’s threshold qualities notwithstanding, a wall is empirically also a screen, or cover; a function of particular importance to medieval and premodern urban Arab-Muslim culture, with its traditional enclaustration and veiling of women.&quot;[O&#x27;Meara, Simon *Space and Muslim Urban Life: At the Limits of the Labyrinth of Fez (Culture and Civilization in the Middle East)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Visible at ground level, the complete perimeter of the casemate system can be traced around the tell,3 with the inner wall along its crest (Fig. 5. 1) and the outer wall lower down on the slope (except in Field B, see below). The defensive wall consists first of a solid wall with offsets and insets along its outer face (Stratum IX), followed by a casemate system with parallel walls joined by cross walls at intervals, forming interior rooms or compartments (Stratum VIII).&quot;[Daviau, P. M. Michele, Paul-Eugene Dion, Ronald G. V. Hancock, David Hemsworth, Margaret A. Judd, Ryan Defonzo, and Douglas W. Schnurrenberger *Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan, Volume 1: The Iron Age Town*.

<li>&quot;The western half of Wall C contains a ca. 16 m long fragment of a very specific wall structure (Wall C1, see Fig. 2), preserved in up to two stone courses of its regular masonry. This Wall C1 and its material and constructional characteristics will be the focus of the following considerations. Some portions of surface have been seriously affected by consolidation interventions, especially those of the 1960s.&quot;[Le Brun, Nicolas *Building knowledge, construction history. 2 vols.

<li>&quot;1994:150, fig. 3). In Building 700 at Tall Jawa, a stone pier wall supports one end of a lintel over a doorway between Rooms 712 and R713 (see below). This same construction technique was used at Busayra, where a “pier” wall (90) bonds with the outer wall, and serves as a cross wall between two rooms (Bienkowki 2001: fig. 3; 2002: fig. 4. 5). While this technique is also used in casemate wall systems, what is of interest here is its use in domestic structures.&quot;[Daviau, P. M. Michele, Paul-Eugene Dion, Ronald G. V. Hancock, David Hemsworth, Margaret A. Judd, Ryan Defonzo, and Douglas W. Schnurrenberger *Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan, Volume 1: The Iron Age Town*. Brill Academic Publishers, 2003.]</li>

<li>&quot;However when the wall is a very thick one (e. g. a city wall) standing damp has a noxious result. The drying out process is mainly at the faces leaving the core damp. Thus the wall consists ofvirtually two different materials each with different physical properties and the faces tend to scale away at a plane of cleavage, perhaps 30-socms in from the surface.&quot;[Wright, G.R.H. *Ancient Building in South Syria and Palestine*.

<li>&quot;Cavity walls. This type of construction is now very common and is generally preferred to solid wall construction for many types of buildings, especially houses. A cavity wall is usually an external wall. It consists of two separate walls of brickwall, having a cavity between, and connected together by metal ties. 62 Notes: bar стержень cavity wall bond retaining wall подпорная стенка сцепление longitudinal продольный пустотелая (полая) стена shear stress срезывающее напряжение tensile растягивающий tie wire проволока weave - wove – woven плеcти 63 элемент, работающий на растяжение expanded metal просечно-вытяжной металлический лист 64 C. 3.&quot;[Г.И., Железнякова *Civil Engineering Часть 1*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;[16, 17] This wall is the line of support where many of the transfer beams mentioned above terminate and ﬁnd bearing surface. The wall is approximately 7. 5 meters long. At the bottom portion of this wall is a bookcase, a low horizontal wood unit measuring approximately 1. 12 meters high by 5 meters in length, sheathed with sliding glass doors. [18] The bookcase is not on the wall, but recessed so that it consumes virtually the entire depth of the wall, the front face of the woodwork set perfectly ﬂush with the wall’s plaster ﬁnish.&quot;[Kleinman, Kent, and Leslie Van Duzer *Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s Krefeld Villas*.

<li>&quot;Photo 4 shows a number of hold-downs connecting the gable end wall to the wall below. However, while these connectors will likely keep these walls together, the depth of the floor framing implies that the lower wall will likely separate easily from the masonry wall below. In addition, after Andrew, concern focused on details of fastening at the perimeter of roof sheathing panels and the structure below.&quot;[de Leon, Diaz, and Alicia E *Forensic Engineering 2015 : performance of the built environment : proceedings of the Seventh Congress on Forensic Engineering, November 15-18, 2015, Miami, Florida*.

<li>&quot;This occurs when a window opening creates a divide within the wall section, similar to a control joint in a floor slab. As the wall shrinks, the wall section on either side of the opening behaves as unit. As the wall sections attempt to pull away from the opening, stress builds up along the precast lintel that is bridging the two wall sections. This condition results in horizontal friction or shearing of the mortar between the wall and the precast lintel.&quot;[de Leon, Diaz, and Alicia E *Forensic Engineering 2015 : performance of the built environment : proceedings of the Seventh Congress on Forensic Engineering, November 15-18, 2015, Miami, Florida*.
