These elements are what will act as the indices by which we will compute the projections and searches within and across the domains. We shall therefore here outline how these elements will act as symbolic representations for their domains, and how this representation is achieved through different ways of encoding the information.", "suggested_query": "The elements will be categorized into three main groups: primitives, composites, and abstractions. Primitives represent the most basic units of information, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, which will serve as the foundation for the more complex composites. Composites, on the other hand, will be constructed from these primitives through various operations and combinations, allowing for the representation of more complex entities and relationships. Abstractions, finally, will capture the higher-level concepts and patterns that emerge from the interactions of the primitives and composites.", "suggest_context": "3.3 ELEMENTALS Now that we've established the material we'll be using, this chapter will discuss the ways in which the contents are resolved into their subsequent elements.
