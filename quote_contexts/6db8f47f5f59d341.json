Our current infrastructures compress space and time until everything meets everything else on a flat plane of equivalence. In response to the shrinking of physical distance in the 20th century Martin Heidegger expressed this concern: What is happening here when, as a result of the abolition of great distances, everything is equally far and equally near? What is this uniformity in which everydung is neither far nor near-is, as it were, without distance? In a way we now face a similar condition but in terms of information within the digital. The thesis responds by introducing architectural constructs - casts, scales, frames, and measures - that do not fight the network, but give it interior structure and re-introduce distance into the latent space through the design of these constructs. In practice this meant writing with a public corpus switched on by personal curation, projecting across images and texts, and letting films act as naturally multimodal hinges. Near and far became adjustable qualities again, not fixed facts of the medium.\n\n*In this manner, the digital infrastructure is reimagined as a layered, stratified space where the proximity of information can be intentionally crafted and navigated. By designing the digital environment as a palimpsest of interconnected, yet distinct, spaces, the user is able to reconstitute their own path through the network, rediscovering the experiential dimensions of distance and proximity that had been lost in the flat plane of equivalence. Through this reorientation, the digital infrastructure is transformed from a mere conduit for information to a dynamic, experiential terrain that enables new forms of exploration, discovery, and comprehension.*", "suggested_query": "In this manner, the digital infrastructure is reimagined as a layered, stratified space where the proximity of information can be intentionally crafted and navigated.
