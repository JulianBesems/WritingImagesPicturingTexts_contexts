01. "*In this respect, content and expression could be seen as two different domains giving form to each other. The process of formalisation could be seen as a form of communication.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=184&annotation=26A4N5IC)"

02. "*In this sense, informational faces are beyond objective and subjective, practical and poetic. As Eco would say, we are lost in the infinity of lists, but we are ready for informational plays in the world of data. A different space is opening up. We are able to tell stories by articulating and playing with the generic* [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=329&annotation=MHG4I2XG)"

03. "*The generic is not continuous or discreet. It can be perceived in both ways. This is the paradox. Everything is the same, but all elements are different at any given moment.* — **Great for quantum and domain** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=23&annotation=SFZ4W4HJ)"

04. "*The same structure models different subjects by training with different data* — **A multiplicity of the domain which is specified through an abundance of context. The domain that this passes through defines the nature of the required context.** [Guo and Li - 2017 - Evolutionary approach for spatial architecture lay.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D4ND54V3?page=4&annotation=SJ73KCRS)"

05. "*In fact, how to maintain a circular relationship between the universal and the singular without collapsing them to the same, or keeping them mutually exclusive, is one of the greatest challenges that the digital world opens up.* — **!!!!!!!! VERY IMPORTANT - NON COMMENSURABLE DOMAINS** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=26&annotation=RH4BT5ZQ)"

06. "*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&annotation=WA8NIH6S)"

07. "*Again, this small play was taken place with-out imposing any predefined and external categories on books.* — **Question of categorisation of things through context is useful. Could evolve in the vectorisation of activated SOM. Another inversion by shelves of new and current things. Might be conceptually relatable to the renaissance study of astronomy (ludger piece in coding as literacy)** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=370&annotation=ZT8EKUYM)"

08. "*Therefore all these techniques necessarily reduce the lifeworld into a few parameters. As a parenthesis, consider how many dimensions are needed to model and modulate simply the physical matter activating a given situation. 8 One could defend such a practice by claiming that these techniques extract certain essential features of the phenomena in question, and so give some insight into the collective lived experience of those phenomena. But usually, an argument for why we should grant some sort of registration between the phenomenon and the trace is not made.* — **Stress for the need of taking up the explicit choices of limitations that are collected** [10.1515_9783035606393.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3H53K9Y2?page=125&annotation=XJCZM6BC)"

09. "*the only way of dealing with information is abstraction, and it can be adequately used only by those who are, in a mass of information, able to define their contexts as flexible, adjustable fields of possibilities with polyvalent, and ultimately undecidable, meaningfulness.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt & Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=20&annotation=PCDGV9M8)"

10. "*His question was not about what each of them was. Therefore his is not a logical talk within a nature, but a talk between different natures.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt & Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=64&annotation=R4CZVPIK)"
