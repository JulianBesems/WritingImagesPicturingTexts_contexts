    <div class="selected">Mapping is a motif frequently invoked in writing on gender, race, and performance—skin as a text provides a particular type of terrain. Skin, as a tactile organ, is also a means of communication. One of the reasons that skin is such a rich site to explore, we believe, or one of the reasons that artists use skin, is that skin “signs” are coded in different ways, and sometimes in more ambiguous ways than traditional literary texts. Skin can be visually perceived as can any map, yet it can also be touched and penetrated.[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</div>

      <li>&quot;The racial fetish, metonymized as animal or Papuan skin in Loos’s work, provides the pivot on which Modernist aesthetic values turn: essence versus veneer, plainness versus excess, utility versus waste, taste versus vulgarity. Yet, as we have started to see, the pivot—that haunting skin—is itself already contaminated. Modern architecture may in fact be quite naked, though not in the senses of purity or transparency as is traditionally claimed, but rather in the very material sense of embodying a profound nostalgia for, if not a downright imitation of, the lost, originary, naked skin.&quot;[Cheng, Anne Anlin *Second Skin: Josephine Baker &amp; the Modern Surface*. Oxford University Press, 2011.]</li>

<li>&quot;Acosta&#x27;s definition of writing, then, presupposed that a graphic sign (letter, character, or image) inscribed on a solid surface (paper, parchment, or bark of a tree) was needed in order to have writing. A bunch of knotted strings of different colors would not qualify as such for an insightful observer as analytically minded as Acosta. However, when Acosta had to describe what a quipu was and how it was used, he could not avoid using the notion of &quot;writing&quot;; even more, he made a perfect analogy between writing with letters and writing with strings, colors, and knots.&quot;[Boone, Elizabeth Hill, and Walter D.

<li>&quot;The well-preserved stucco dressing on fragments of tufa columns near the  entrance to the Acropolis, which belonged to an old temple probably destroyed  by the Persians, is also red. The columns of the temple at Metapontum were colored in a different  way. They must have been in keeping with the somber color of the terra-cotta  with which most greater Greek and Sicilian temples in the older style were  decorated. This more somber, oligochrome (moving within limited color  shades) style of wall decoration used not red but yellow ocher as a surface  ground. 326 Red was used only as an enlivening element in the harmony of colors. In this it differs in principle from another style that dominated very early  on in Asia Minor and Greece, at least for temples and public buildings. In that  style a magnificent red (even now the color reserved for the walls of imperial  buildings and temples in such Oriental countries as China) formed the basis  of the polychrome system. &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Certainly the use of certain motives unique to metal-bar construction for  formal ends can be defended, such as the motives of fitting things together and the ligatures found in the joints. But on the whole this is infertile ground  for art. It is not possible to speak of a monumental metal-bar style or cast-  iron style; their ideal is invisible architecture! For the thinner the metal tissue,  the more perfect it is. Things are different when metal is used either for tubular construction (a  form with which we are familiar from the first volume) or for lattice construction (which in principle is close to the former). Both are equally important to  our theory of style (see “Metallurgy”). &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Skin metaphors are ubiquitous in contemporary art and architectural theory. Not only are “skins” of artworks and buildings frequently referred to, but the metaphors and mechanics of skin as the body’s surface are applied to artworks—the skin’s self-regulation, its ability to adapt to changing environments, its permeable surface, as well as skin’s organic nature. Artists and architects are drawing upon a long history of examining the relationship of, and distinctions between, façade and building, surface and depth.&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*.

<li>&quot;These objects can be arranged to form a mosaic as in Figure 8, be used to spell out words, or simply be used to add color as in Figure 9. The large red dot at the middle of the marker in Figure 9 is a reflector; it is surrounded by a design of multicolored marbles. The reader may have noticed already that the content and style of the inscriptions on these markers frequently adds as much to the character of the folk design as the pictorial decorations. While some lettering is barely legible and contains only the most essential information, other inscriptions are lettered and spaced on the stone with utmost clarity and precision.&quot;[Abernethy, Francis Edward *Folk Art in Texas (Publications of the Texas Folklore Society)*. Southern Methodist University Press, Dallas, Texas, 1985.]</li>
<li>&quot;But while not impossible, the author is unaware of any surviving examples of dō made using such materials, which would lack the resilience needed to be an effective protective material, despite their aesthetic appeal. By contrast, however, exotic materials like shark skin (same-gawa) were sometimes used in armour construction, though same-gawa was utilized as a covering for armour plating and not as the primary protective material. As the example of shark skin demonstrates, unusual characteristics should not be misinterpreted, for while they may be unique, the feature itself may not override the identifiable base form in which the cuirass has been constructed.&quot;[Absolon, Trevor *Samurai Armour, Volume I: The Japanese Cuirass*. Bloomsbury, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;From the top of a page down various parts of the printed design would be, say, blue, green, yellow, orange and then red, the distribution of the colors being unrelated to the formal structure of the design, as if the colors were part of some vast pattern that momentarily happened to be moving through the printed design. The pressmen called this flow-color, or split-fountain inking, but nobody had ever heard of doing this before.&quot;[Perry, Charles *The Haight-Ashbury: A History*. Random House USA Inc, 1988.]</li>
<li>&quot;Aristocrats would use its exuberance in design to flex their riches to visitors, bragging about their wealth and power with architecture, art, and interior design. Brass, gold, gilded surfaces, brocades, marble, and onyx are only some of the opulent materials used to define the language of Baroque design—quite the opposite of using a fibrous and recyclable material like cardboard. Because of this utilitarian quality of cardboard, Jillian’s pieces take on more meaning than simply beautifully constructed ornamentation.&quot;[Zimmer, Lori *The Art of Cardboard: Big Ideas for Creativity, Collaboration, Storytelling, and Reuse*. Rockport Publishers, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;T h e rectangular design of the pig sty (ivam ai), with its stalls, is of ten drawn with a stick in path dirt. T h e cutting of the pig skin is also drawn. A n outline of the steamed pig skin is scratched into the earth w i t h a sharp stick. T h e n the children cut it up, marking the cuts of the bamboo knife, and saying which piece goes to w h o m . Sometimes a simpler version of this is made b y drawing a series of rectangles, w h e r e each rectangle represents a piece of skin.&quot;[Heider, Karl G. *The Dugum Dani: A Papuan Culture in the Highlands of West New Guinea*. Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, 1970.]</li>
<li>&quot;One of Deskey’s furniture critics also referred to ‘dishonest’ designs, such as those made of metal painted to simulate the appearance of wood, as ‘mongrel’ forms. 72 Interestingly, Dreyfuss’s use of the term resonated with Teague’s concerns, owing to their common interest in the Greek principles of dynamic symmetry. To Dreyfuss, any design that was not geometric in its basic shapes, principles and proportion constituted a ‘mongrel’ form. 73 When ‘mongrel’ designs are contrasted against ‘ideal’ product types, with the difference stemming largely from how closely a product design adhered to what were considered by designers to be the fundamental design laws of nature, it is not surprising that designers insisted upon studying nature and the design of living organisms as the basis for their bringing about ‘pure form’ in streamline product design (such as that exemplified by the blimp or Dreyfuss’s dynamically symmetrical forms). 74 For example, Arens upheld the whale as the best model for ship design, and designers closely studied the intricacies of the salmon and the Pacific plover in order to better understand the streamline adaptations of fishes and birds.&quot;[Brauer, Fae, and Anthea Callen (eds.) *Art, Sex and Eugenics: Corpus Delecti*.

<li>&quot;Art is not intended to be a kind of photography, a reflection of reality, but rather a translation of that reality. What, then, does it mean to stylise?This is the art of tastefully conventionalising a model from nature, using natural objects with wit to make them more decorative. Take the example of the acanthus leaf, a key to styles down the ages!It has inspired extraordinary stylised representations!The acanthus leaves that decorated Greek Corinthian capitals were modelled on the thorny leaves of the real plant acanthus spinosus; the Romans used (and some would say over-used) the smoother leaves of the acanthus mollis; and the broad acanthus leaf of the Renaissance then replaced the highly stylised, simplified leaf used by the Romans.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*.

<li>&quot;Spread form Catalog Design. At the same time, Sutnar was not an invisible designer. While his basic structures were decidedly rational, the choices he made in juxtaposition, scale, and color were rooted in sophisticated principles of abstract design, bringing sensitive composition, visual charm, and emotional drama to his workaday subjects. He developed a distinctive vocabulary, or style, notable for arrows, fever lines, black bullets, and other repeated devices. He used all of the above to direct the reader through hierarchies of information, and indeed promoted these devices in Catalog Design Progress as the correct forms for guiding readers (which contributed to a kind of Sutnar-biased conformity among later designers).&quot;[Heller, Steven *The Graphic Design Reader*. Allworth Press, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Ohr’s methods of surface decoration are also drawn from the folk tradition. He often used sponging, a typical design in which a sponge coated in iron oxide was pressed around the circumference of the body, creating a modest but pleasing pattern. There are instances when Ohr used this motif on traditionally functional forms that were then made nonfunctional, such as pitchers with zigzag handles that are too diﬃcult to grasp and too thin to support vessels. In these instances Ohr creates a jarring juxtaposition of purist utility and visual oddity.&quot;[Ohr, George E., Ellen J. Lippert, and George E Ohr *George Ohr : sophisticate and rube*.

<li>&quot;Note the use of a gold dust-infused lacquer. In some cases, cotton wadding was packed behind the liner to help make a dō more comfortable to wear and to fill in any voids that were created by various aspects of the finished design of the cuirass, such as behind embossed features. Strips or sheets of old rice paper, or washi, were also sometimes used to smooth over and fill any voids between the inner surface of a cuirass and the liner. Several sheets of paper were also sometimes layered together to create padded areas.&quot;[Absolon, Trevor *Samurai Armour, Volume I: The Japanese Cuirass*. Bloomsbury, 2017.]</li>

Reprinted from Paul Hambruch and Anneliese Eilers, Ponape: Gesellschaft und Geistige Kultur, Wirtschaft und Stoffliche Kultur (Hamburg: Friedrichsen, De Gruyter, 1936), 2:277. 23. The design is formed by the interplay of light and dark, of clear skin and marked skin, of positive and negative. Both elements are necessary to create the pattern, which weaves ink and skin together to form a kind of living tapestry.&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*.

<li>&quot;This feature recurs in the other moko in the film. In those designs, too, rather than using upper- and lower-cheek design fields, a single spiral takes up the entire cheek. As a result of using the entire cheek for a single spiral, the patterns are even bolder and stronger than traditional motifs—and less detailed. The film moko tend not to use pākati lines, hatching or notches that, like ladder or chevron patterns, demarcate without filling in space within a spiral. The patterns also tend not to use the anchor koru or elaborate scroll patterns discussed, for example, in Te Pehi Kupe’s moko.&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*. Columbia University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;And because cutting uses a blade that cuts a continuous line into the skin, the resulting design can be very precise. Sometimes the cutter will cut a thin line on the skin, but larger pieces of skin can be removed as well, leaving a wider, and sometimes deeper, scar. In addition, tattoo pigment can be rubbed into the open wound, resulting in a colored scar. Cutting as a symptom of a mental or emotional disorder is generally quite different. In this case, the individual takes a blade and cuts their own skin, generally without a plan or decorative intent, and often obssessively, in order to try to cope with their emotional problems.&quot;[DeMello, Margo *Encyclopedia of Body Adornment*. Greenwood, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;The design motifs used in Hleeta consist of raised dots arranged in rows, arcs, triangles, lozenges, and chevrons (Figure 3. 3A). The same design patterns are used by all Ga’anda groups, even though some of the communities have been geographically separated long enough to develop distinct dialects (Berns 1988:57). Similar designs appear on what Berns (1988:68) refers to as “public arts,” including beer pots, baskets, armlets and charms, and the exterior walls of houses and granaries.&quot;[Deter-Wolf, Aaron *Drawing with great needles : ancient tattoo traditions of North America*.
