    <pre>FLOOR. . . staking the claim of civilization on the raw ground, encoding usage and assuming decoration. The textural details of previous occupants are kept intact. Featureless and soundless except for sneakers, which squeak on it. Despite this, the language of space planning is the floor plan, and its graphic qualities cannot be entirely ignored. These added drawing elements make for more easily read and communicative floor plans.

<em>The floor plan&#x27;s ability to convey spatial relationships and spatial logic is due to its abstract representation of the physical space. It can be seen as a form of notation, a way of capturing the essence of a space and its many aspects, including the relationships between its various parts. The floor plan&#x27;s visual syntax is a language that can be deciphered and interpreted, a visual grammar that communicates the structure and organization of the space.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;The primary concern of this text is space planning, not design presentation. Despite this, the language of space planning is the floor plan, and its graphic qualities cannot be entirely ignored. One of the premises of the planning methodology presented here is that the transition from the rough floor plan to the preliminary or presentation floor plan is part of the planning process, not just a graphic refinement.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Although some physical planning has taken place, in drawing prototypical plan sketches of specific functions or rooms and abstract relationship diagrams of the organization as a whole, the overall plan has not yet been approached from a realistic planning viewpoint. The initial leap from these pre-design steps to the more creative development of a floor plan that solves the practical and esthetic problems of users is the most difficult and critical element in the space planning process.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;The adjacent set of stairs leads up to the master bedroom, children&#x27;s bedrooms, and bathroom.

<li>&quot;FLOOR Infinitely harmless, the floor Is  obliged to offer Its occupants  stability -  yet receives from  Its users systematic harshness,  If not abuse, in return. k e lle r e a s t e r lin g FLOOR PAGE 1 floor . . . once a surface for symbolic expression -  defining the way  spaces are used, implying the &#x27;rules of the game&#x27; -  floors in  the 20th century tended towards a purely Cartesian surface. . .  rational, undecorated, unloved, perfectly flat, ideally soundless-  simultaneous with our neglect of programmatic, symbolic,  and haptic potential, floor space became the dominant economic  measure of architectural space: real estate adopted a fetish  of the m2, masking the reality of the three-dimensional volume,  and the floor itself is typically a thick slab, sometimes a &#x27;false  floor&#x27; containing mysteries similar to those of the ceiling. . .&quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;Another example of concealed storage is the grooved timber, lit up to highlight their contours and the bust by Ralph Brown. Assessing a space and planning the layout is something that has always come naturally to me because I find it very easy to visualize a room in three dimensions – a cuboid made up of six vertical and horizontal planes: four walls, a ceiling and a floor.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;By the turn of the 18th century, they dictated room sizes and proportions, as in a four-mat, six-mat,  or eight-mat room. The module also determined the structural grid of the entire dwelling. In the postwar  housing crisis, minimal dwellings were expressed as tatami, and the modular unit has remained in PAGE 28 FLOOR The apparently solid floor (designed by Kingspan) becomes a secret cavity for hiding the building&#x27;s support  systems, mostly wiring. The constant change implied by the open plan office requires a system for easy  adaptation hidden in the floor, formerly the most stable element, now another a symbol of impermanence. &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;That said, it should be remembered that arbitrarily eliminating as many interior walls as possible will not necessarily result in a better space. While floor area and elbow room are inevitably gained, wall space is lost. This may affect the possibilities for furniture placement and storage options. Open-concept layouts are great so long as they truly correspond with the necessities at hand.&quot;[Shafer, Jay *The Small House Book*. Tumbleweed Tiny House, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;For examples, a single space could be bedroom, study room and parlour at the same time. The charm of the &quot;mix and match&quot; of functions lies in the relaxing atmosphere created in such a multi-functional space. Meanwhile, to some extent, such an unconventional space layout would likely free us from certain constraints. The space with a European style shown above is mainly used as a study room.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*. Design Media Publishing Ltd, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;A planning module usually extends from the floor to the ceiling and may have any desired floor area. The planning module is a complete unit; it has its own HV AC and lighting and telephone services. Consequently, it may be enclosed by placement of partitions along its borders without impairment of function. The space assigned for any use in any story of the building therefore, can be assembled by addition of as many modules as needed to supply the required floor area.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;A floor plan illustrates an overhead view, while an elevation drawing illustrates a face‑on view. Your drawings will be the basis for obtaining permits, negotiating contracts with tradespeople, and ordering products. To begin, make a rough sketch of the existing floor plan. Measure and record the size and location of all existing fixtures and mechanicals from a fixed point.&quot;[Press, Editors of Cool Springs *Black &amp; Decker Complete Guide to Bathrooms 5th Edition : Dazzling Upgrades &amp; Hardworking Improvements You Can Do Yourself*. 5th ed. Minneapolis: Quayside Publishing Group, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;Hence, 585 the smaller the area for vertical circulation, the more usable floor area for a given perimeter, or the smaller the perimeter for a required usable floor area. Often, if more usable area can be obtained for each floor, the lower are the number of stories required for the building. Because of the lower height of the building, there will be savings in costs of interior and exterior walls, piping, wiring, stairs and elevat0fs.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;This is especially key within a large open-plan and multifunctional living space, where the grid is fundamental in defining different zones. Creating interesting vistas and using focal points to draw the eye from one area to another will enhance the sense of vitality and energy within a space. Lighting is another way to add drama.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>

<li>&quot;Figure 4 shows that the expressions contained in the seismic provisions of the UBC 1997 and ASCE/SEI 7-10 to determine floor accelerations for the design of nonstructural components are representative of the floor acceleration envelope.

<li>&quot;ARCHITECTURAL PROGRAM The design team employed traditional architectural layout methods, which began from “bubble diagrams” developed in an adjacency study during the planning phase. The diagrams indicated that the building required three main space groupings to meet the functional needs of the Ranger staff: staff offices, meeting and assembly space, and locker rooms with showers and storage for personal protective equipment (PPE).&quot;[Lynn, Abraham C., and Robert Reitherman *AEI 2011 : building integration solutions : proceedings of the 2011 Architectural Engineering National Conference, March 30-April 2, 2011 Oakland, California*.

<li>&quot;‘It enables us to navigate the junctions of public and private space, and somehow the plan eases movement within its clear circulation system. In practical terms, it means areas can be closed off and different points of access used. ’ This is necessary when people want to enter the gallery space run by Michael. This expansive, window-lined room faces the street, and here an atmosphere of containment has been engineered by raising the floor by 300mm and building a plywood insert which forms the floor, extensive shelving for books, walls and areas for the display of Michael’s highly curated objects and works of art.&quot;[McCartney, Karen *The Alchemy of Things: Interiors Shaped by Curious Minds*.
