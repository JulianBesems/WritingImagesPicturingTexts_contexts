As the navigation through particular casts unfolds, it is as if we are charting a new geography, where the contours of similarity and dissimilarity take on a tangible, three-dimensional quality. This endeavour requires a delicate balance between the precision of computational mapping and the intuitive sense of spatial awareness that allows us to navigate the terrain with ease.", "suggest_context": "A certain kind of unlimited sits behind contemporary multimodal systems: oppositions and differences that are present everywhere, yet not necessarily brought into determinate relation.
