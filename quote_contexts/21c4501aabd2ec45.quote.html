    <pre>2. MULTIMODALITY Where chapter 1 situated the thesis within architecture, this chapter will serve to formulate a perspective onto the primary condition that the thesis revolves around: multimodality. Before introducing the experimental setup, this chapter first reviews the current occurrences of multimodal relations between domains of information within computation and architecture. This will serve as the technical-theoretical basis upon which the experiments will reflect. As previously stated, the aim is not to prescribe applications for architectural representation, but to draw from how architects already work across modalities in order to frame digital multimodal models from an architectonic perspective.

<em>In this context, multimodality refers to the capacity of digital tools and systems to operate across multiple modes of representation, such as text, image, video, and audio, as well as the ability of users to switch seamlessly between these modes. This fundamental characteristic of digital systems has been widely discussed within the fields of human-computer interaction, cognitive science, and linguistics, but has yet to be fully explored within the context of architectural representation and design. As a result, this chapter will seek to bridge this gap by examining the multimodal aspects of architectural information processing and communication, with a focus on the potential benefits and challenges that arise from the integration of multiple modalities in architectural design and representation.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;It is not an abstract concept, and its qualities cannot be described generally or schematically. It cannot be associated reliably with the way we speak or breathe. Nor can its function be understood merely from its visual appearance on the page. ” Printed books altered our relationship to poetry by allowing us to see the lines more readily. What new challenges do electronic reading devices pose?In a printed book, the width of the page and the size of the type are fixed. Usually, because the page is wide enough and the type small enough, a line of poetry fits comfortably on the page: What you see is what you’re supposed to hear as a unit of sound.&quot;[John Ashbery [Ashbery, John] *Can You Hear, Bird: Poems*.

<li>&quot;Michael is twenty-three years old. He has been a computer primer in this interface crew for eleven years. By now the work is purely automatic for him; he has become simply an extension of the machinery. Drifting along the interface, he boosts or drains, shunts or couples, blends or splits, meeting every need of the computer he serves, and does it all in cool mindless efficiency, operating on reflex alone. There is nothing reprehensible about this. It is not desirable for a primer to think, merely to act correctly; even here in the fifth century of computer technology the human brain is still given a high rating for its information-handling capacity per cubic centimeter, and a properly trained interface crew is in effect a group of ten of these excellent little organically grown computers jacked into the main unit.&quot;[Silverberg, Robert *The World Inside*. Doubleday &amp; Co. Inc., 1971.]</li>
<li>&quot;But unlike a printed book, which is stable, an ebook is a shape-shifter. Electronic type may be reflowed across a galaxy of applications and interfaces, across a variety of screens, from phone to tablet to computer. And because the reader of an ebook is empowered to change the size of the type, a poem’s original lineation may seem to be altered in many different ways. As the size of the type increases, the likelihood of any given line running over increases. Our typesetting standard for poetry is designed to register that when a line of poetry exceeds the width of the screen, the resulting run-over line should be indented, as it might be in a printed book.&quot;[John Ashbery [Ashbery, John] *Can You Hear, Bird: Poems*. Open Road Media, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Taka Ouellette&#x27;s awed appreciation of proline as a metabolic catalyst will probably be a little behind the times by mid-century, since Movassaghi and Jacobsen have already pointed out the potential of such simple molecules to act as enzymes22. The Chemistry of Character Some readers may wonder if I have trouble distinguishing between personality and neurochemistry. It&#x27;s a fair point, but don&#x27;t blame me: blame the scientists who can&#x27;t let a week go by without reporting yet more evidence that personality is just another word for biochemistry, albeit written in an exceedingly complex font (e. g.&quot;[Watts, Peter *Behemoth: B-Max &amp; Seppuku*.

<li>&quot;The process, the completion I found in hanging it up to dry, silently congratulating myself on a job well done. I know this is an abstraction of reality; that I need to work on appreciating the now in a more direct way, rather than living for a future now. This time, however, the darkroom was a million miles away. Confusion burst through my mind like an unpleasant climax, little mind-stars flaring as synapses screamed and spent their load. Love. Anger. Hate. Rage. Love.&quot;[Listi, Brad, Kristopher Young, Kate Holden, Tony O&#x27;Neill, Carlton Mellick III, and Bradley Sands *Falling From the Sky (Anthology)*. another sky press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Work continued to be OK, if not riveting. Spurred on by my newfound positivity, I found the wherewithal to leave the YTS Training Centre, and got a new and interesting job at Northwick Park Hospital, working in occupational therapy. My role was to use computers to ascertain patients’ cognitive skills after they had suffered a head trauma or stroke, which is perhaps why the word ‘stroke’ still has such serious connotations for me.&quot;[Holland, Nigel *The 50 List – a Father&#x27;s Heartfelt Message to his Daughter.

<li>&quot;You&#x27;d be proud of me. BASTILLE Sudbury rose in the night like a luminous tumor. Its core glowed from within, faintly by dryback standards but bright as day to Lenie Clarke: a walled, claustrophobic cluster of refitted skyscrapers in an abandoned wasteland of suburbs and commercial zones. The static field was obvious by inference. The new buildings and the grafted retrofits, the galls of living space wedged into the gaps between buildings—all extended to the inner edge of the field and no further. Like metastasis constrained under glass, Sudbury had grown into a hemisphere.&quot;[Watts, Peter *Behemoth: B-Max &amp; Seppuku*. Tor Books, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;It&#x27;s been suggested that they represent axes, and that this proves that these circles were not places of worship, but the focal points of a Cult of the Axe which existed in western Europe in neolithic times. Or the stones may have enclosed a marketplace, and the axial stone was the counter on which goods were traded. I have to say, though, that shopping seems an unlikely motive to me. Proponents of this undeniably imaginative theory make comparisons with shopping malls, which might be seen as the new temples.&quot;[McCarthy, Pete *McCarthy&#x27;s Bar: A Journey of Discovery In Ireland*.

<li>&quot;Here is the place for the application of all the knowledge I have acquired. Time assumes another dimension now—work and absorption in the search for an answer. The world around me and my past seem far away and distorted, as if time and space were taffy being stretched and looped and twisted out of shape. The only real things are the cages and the mice and the lab equipment here on the fourth floor of the main building. There is no night or day. I&#x27;ve got to cram a lifetime of research into a few weeks.&quot;[Keyes, Daniel *Flowers for Algernon*. Mariner Books, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;I notice the litter. An empty cider can stuffed into a privet hedge here, a screwed up chip wrapper in the gutter there, cigarette butts everywhere on the cracked, grey slabs. As I draw nearer still to the Project, the quantity and variety of this detritus grows. An abandoned shopping trolley half-on and half-off the kerb; fast food cartons; crushed-up fag packets. Beer cans: mostly cheap, strong lager, some stamped flat, others skittering and rolling around in the breeze. I stop at the driveway. The Project is an imposing building: three storeys high, it has ornate brickwork, a high, sloping roof and large stone gateposts.&quot;[Smith, Winston *Generation F*. Monday Books, 2011.]</li>
