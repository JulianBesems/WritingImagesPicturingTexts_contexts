Here speed is important, because we're dealing with a large set of relatively high dimensional data (~1.1M x 300). Apart from speed the other priority is that the concern isn't necessarily to just find the most similar books, but rather facilitate a view from the full collection of books and their subsequent contents on a particular point of view (generally this point is defined by on or multiple books of its own.", "suggested_query": "The screens are designed to efficiently process this vast amount of data, leveraging the strengths of SOMs in handling high-dimensional data. By casting a projection onto this screen, the system can quickly identify the most relevant books that share similar characteristics with the target book, providing a comprehensive view of the collection.", "suggest_context": "3.4 CONSTRUCTING THE 'SCREENS' This chapter is how to start establishing the screens, between which the different projections are cast. The screens are constructed through the technology of SOMs or the navigation through the whole of the data in the manner of a dataset query. We use the term screen because it is constrctued to facilitate the casting of a projection on a full domain of information, in principle to address a particular character of the way in which the projection is to be constructed. TEXT book Within the text domain, the first screen is that for the books. Here speed is important, because we're dealing with a large set of relatively high dimensional data 1.1M x 300.
