This syntax will also provide a framework for the rules of inference and transformation that govern the relationships between the elements, enabling us to reason about the domains in a more systematic and formal manner. The development of this syntax is crucial for the successful application of the methods to be described in the following chapters.", "suggest_context": "3.3 ELEMENTALS Now that we've established the material we'll be using, this chapter will discuss the ways in which the contents are resolved into their subsequent elements. These elements are what will act as the indices by which we will compute the projections and searches within and across the domains. We shall therefore here outline how these elements will act as symbolic representations for their domains, and how this representation is achieved through different ways of encoding the information."}
