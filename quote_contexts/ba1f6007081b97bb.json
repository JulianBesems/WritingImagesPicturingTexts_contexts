Where does the simplicitly sit? In functional programming, through sheer elegance in code? Or exactly the opposite, where there is an absence of code in the operation? But then what about the literacy, because this is the clever thing about Ishigami and Nishizawa, they don't just automate or make something clean, they do the unexpected, impossible through sophisticated technological ability and knowledge - Literacy, but silently. Then how can we approach this not in the engineering manner but in the digital concept?", "suggested_query": "In digital design, ornamentation often takes the form of visual elements such as patterns, textures, and icons that are used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of a digital product or service. These elements can be used to create visual interest, guide the user's attention, and even convey meaning or mood. By incorporating ornamentation into a digital design, designers can add depth, complexity, and emotion to the user experience.", "suggest_context": "Then what is the surface of ornament in a digital context?"}
