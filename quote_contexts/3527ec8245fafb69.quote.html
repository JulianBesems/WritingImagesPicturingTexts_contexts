<li>&quot;Roughly, the sources of the problem are the different methods used to represent information [6], different levels of specification of the concepts in the domain, and the various levels of systematization or sophistication of the construction participants’ systems. The effective exchanging, sharing, transferring, and integrating of information is embraced within the semantic interoperability paradigm. Semantic interoperability can be defined as the understanding of the information concept representations by domain’s agents.&quot;[Smith, Ian F.C. *Intelligent Computing in Engineering and Architecture: 13th EG-ICE Workshop 2006, Ascona, Switzerland, June 25-30, 2006, Revised Selected Papers*.

<li>&quot;In this view, the design process builds information into the structure of the molecule. But this view would not make sense if we understood the molecule to be simply a discrete and bounded entity. For if molecules were simply discrete entities, how could one then distinguish between a molecule which embodies little information and the ‘same’ molecule with the same structure of elements that embodies a great deal of information?In Whitehead’s and Stengers’s terms it is possible to give a different and more precise meaning to the idea of a material object being rich in information.&quot;[Fraser, Mariam, Sarah Kember, and Celia Lury *Inventive Life: Approaches to the New Vitalism*.

<li>&quot;These descriptions are implemented in a language that has specific syntax. The syntax can be a natural language (e. g. English words), a programming language (e. g. LISP syntax), or any visual representation or topology that aids in communication (e. g. electrical symbols for drawings). An intended model uses a particular interpretation of the language to elaborate representations and create the constraints. The syntax of the languages composes what is called a vocabulary.&quot;[Smith, Ian F.C. *Intelligent Computing in Engineering and Architecture: 13th EG-ICE Workshop 2006, Ascona, Switzerland, June 25-30, 2006, Revised Selected Papers*.

<li>&quot;Their brief sketch-review will be instructive in bringing the characteristics of the informatic dimension and operation of meaning more clearly into view. First, Lash’s ‘critique of information’ highlights the duality of meaning in focus here. Lash argues that there are two types of information in the information society. The first is the production of discursive or analytic knowledge which replaces labour production (2002: 141–4).&quot;[Fraser, Mariam, Sarah Kember, and Celia Lury *Inventive Life: Approaches to the New Vitalism*. SAGE Publications Ltd, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Information is thus a situated event, an event that generates meaning in a system or for an organization. As a generation of meaning, this characterization goes beyond Luhmann’s limitation of information to a ‘selection’ of system states. Information events meaning. In this movement of retention and alteration, the system has an open history. This is why the systems under consideration can rightly be called ‘developmental systems’, for which information is then a central concern (Oyama, 2000).&quot;[Fraser, Mariam, Sarah Kember, and Celia Lury *Inventive Life: Approaches to the New Vitalism*.

<li>&quot;Gregory Bateson oﬀers a concise deﬁnition of information when he claims: “information is a diﬀerence that makes a diﬀerence. ”² The domain of information lies between too little and too much diﬀerence. On the one hand, information is a diﬀerence and, therefore, in the absence of diﬀerence there is no information. On the other hand, information is a diﬀerence that makes a diﬀerence. Not all diﬀerences make a diﬀerence because some diﬀerences are indiﬀerent and hence inconsequential. Both too little and too much diﬀerence creates noise.&quot;[Lunning, Frenchy *Limits of the Human*. University of Minnesota Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;This information was useful in helping neighbors use the tools to describe setting, evaluate situations, and prescribe redevelopment interventions to resolve problems. In this manner, the information system may be thought as the initial notion of what later became the EDC’s reflection space (Arias, 1994). Figure 3. 8: The Information Tool: predecessor of the EDC’s reflection space: (a) the digital base map of COLE on a property-by-property basis with (b) the 3D visualization capabilities of different types of information to indicate a priority area for intervention.&quot;[Arias, Ernesto G., Hal Eden, and Gerhard Fischer *Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory*. Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;The concept of information entailed within the term information system still remains one of the most obscure in our vocabulary. Perhaps the reason for the elusive natures of both information and system can be found in the ontological stratum wherein we perceive the existence of all systems and information?In biological systems, for example, some information contained in (and about) the systems themselves is hardwired: encoded in the form of a genetic code, the double helix of its DNA. This particular form of information contains the basic mechanisms through which these systems gain the capacity to PREFACE XIII replicate themselves, albeit with some variation and mutation.&quot;[Angell, Ian, and Dionysios Demetis *Science&#x27;s First Mistake: Delusions in Pursuit of Theory*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;the theoretical work on information architectures and information spaces by Benyon (2004) of particular interest. According to Benyon’s model on information architectures and design of information spaces (2004) we can, given one basic set of information (e. g. hours, minutes and seconds) in many cases represent this in several different ways (the typical analogue clock vs. a typical digital clock is a good example of this difference). This is also true when it comes to the relation between materials and textures.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

<li>&quot;© 2011 Jason Valdina/Received. com. 229 Building Information Modelling above: GRO Architects, diagram showing the traditional architectural design process, 2008. In traditional architectural practice, a linear exchange of analogue information facilitated interpretation and the need for clariﬁcation on site.&quot;[Carpo, Mario *The digital turn in architecture 1990-2010*. Chichester: Wiley, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;This point is even more poignant if we consider that most of these elements making a building are not designed by architects themselves and their assembly is performed by other professionals. This analogy could also hold true for designing with CAD, as this process can be accomplished by combining architectural elements existing both as textual and as graphic information, as it happens in Building Information Modeling (BIM). 1 Here too hierarchy of information plays a crucial role to produce coherent designs accessible to the various professions participating in the construction process.&quot;[Bottazzi, Roberto *Digital Architecture Beyond Computers: Fragments of a Cultural History of Computational Design*.

<li>&quot;The conceptual architecture of the EDC instantiates Schön’s conceptualization (Schön, 1983) of “reflection-in-action” and “reflection-on-action” as a supporting framework for decision making and conflict resolution. The horizontal tabletop environment in the foreground is an interactive surface coupled with a projected display of a computational information environment using graphical information systems (GIS) and other contextual information. Tangible interaction with the environment takes place by the stakeholders moving the computationally enhanced language of physical objects that are sensed by the interactive table.&quot;[Arias, Ernesto G., Hal Eden, and Gerhard Fischer *Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory*. Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;A Physical Language of Objects to Support Collaborative Participation The development of a common language of objects is considered central to the construction of “meaning” through the interactivity with the tabletop games and simulations in the physical media tools.&quot;[Arias, Ernesto G., Hal Eden, and Gerhard Fischer *Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory*. Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;In Ambient Findability, Morville offers working definitions for the terms “data,” “information,” and “knowledge. ” Data is “a string of identified but unevaluated symbols”; information is “evaluated, validated, or useful data”; and knowledge is “information in the contexts of understanding” (46). What I notice in these definitions is a progression or building between them—data becomes information; information becomes knowledge. I would prefer not to represent the knowledge chain as a linear equation, but it is best illustrated in the following manner as stages.&quot;[Lynch, Paul, and Nathaniel Rivers *Thinking with Bruno Latour in Rhetoric and Composition*.
