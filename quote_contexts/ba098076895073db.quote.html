    <pre>Methodologically, this corpus demonstrates that the instrument is not limited to inherently multimodal sources (like film or illustrated PDFs). Cross-casting can be staged by selecting a textual vocabulary on one side and a curated image set on the other, then proportioning them through the same generic screens. This manufactured adjacency underscores the central claim: projection precedes equivalence and can be made personal without becoming arbitrary.</pre>

      <li>&quot;It seems clear, therefore, that everyday language is bound up with two different traditions: one the tradition of linguistic communication (which requires an attention to the functionality of information), the other the tradition of information technology focused on processes of transforming, coding, and decoding. These telecommunicative processes have a structure, but that structure does not have to be linguistic, meaningful, or capable of being true or false.

<li>&quot;Returning to our previous analysis and discussions of information seeking, now armed with the integration through cybersemiotics of the various ways of determining signification and meaning, we can offer a new understanding of the meaning and use of Idealized Cognition Models (ICMs). I earlier defined the ICM concept as a contextual one and argued that meaning springs from given social uses.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd. University of Toronto Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;I will now analyse the difficulties faced by library and information science (LIS) when it comes to constructing a user-friendly system for mediating electronic documents – especially for information retrieval (IR) – by applying the cognitive information processing paradigm. The main problem with this paradigm is that its concept of information and language does not systematically address how social and cultural dynamics determine the meaning of those signs and words, which are LIS’s basic tools for organizing and retrieving documents.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd. University of Toronto Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;No doubt, the development of interactive and graphic interfaces could improve search quality for occasional users. But something more fundamental to our scientific understanding of document-mediating systems is at stake: the qualitative difference in the way computers and humans deal with the complexity of information. As Luhmann (1995) points out, humans reduce complexity through meaning. If it is to improve the design of document-mediating systems, LIS must move away from a mechanistic, information-processing understanding of document retrieval based on only cognitive science’s information processing paradigm, towards true integration with a more pragmatically semiotic, cybernetic, and socio-linguistic theory of understanding.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd. University of Toronto Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;I have in mind &quot;conceptual role semantics&quot; (Harman 1982; Loar 1982; Loewer 1982; Block 1986), &quot;correlational semantics&quot; (McLaughlin 1987), &quot;information-based semantics&#x27;&#x27; (Fodor 1988), and &quot;interpretational semantics&quot; (Cummins 1989). I object to the practice of using the term &#x27;semantics&#x27; in this dual way on the grounds that it promotes a conflation between two aspects of representation that should be distinguished.&quot;[Von Eckardt, Barbara *What is cognitive science?*. MIT Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;Translation between different message formats and languages is another use for information systems, and not only human language. Computation is now used universally to turn physical motion into commands, through transducers like the mouse, touchscreens, motion sensors, etc. Automated human language translation is, of course, embedded into a sizable fraction of the software we use on a daily basis. This brings us to a third aspect of information associated with infrastructure, which is learning. Learning offers the possibility of escaping the constraints of scale, i. e.&quot;[Burgess, Mark *In Search of Certainty: The science of our information infrastructure*. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;The resulting focus on language as a sequentially ordered practice has increased the appreciation of CA and EM. However, in spite of these insights, information is still usually treated as something that has existence in its own right—that social things are done to and with—that existing independently, information also comes to have a social life. Garfinkel, by contrast, has since 1952 treated information as almost entirely dependent on constitutive social elements for its existence. The classic examinations of the intersection between language and information by Shannon, Weaver, Bateson, etc. , that Garfinkel makes creative use of in this manuscript, date from just before and after the second world war.&quot;[Garfinkel, Harold, and Anne Rawls (ed.) *Toward a Sociological Theory of Information*. Paradigm, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;We add the category of “inferential information” as a possible modifier of primary and secondary information. The term distinguishes between information that stands as the product of a message and information obtained by the communicant’s processes of inference. While the information obtained from a message may be viewed as related to the message through a set of “coding” or “transforming” rules whereby the signal and its referents are matched, it is also possible to obtain information from what one learns directly from the meanings of the message by a chain of judgments whereby sets of meanings other than those meant through the message are implicated with the meanings of the message.&quot;[Garfinkel, Harold, and Anne Rawls (ed.) *Toward a Sociological Theory of Information*. Paradigm, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;In contrast, information-processing capacities of the sort referred to in the combined linking assumption (or what I shall refer to as &quot;narrow information processing capacities&quot;) are purely mental, involving a transformation from one mental representation to another. Because of this difference in scope, the identification between ordinary input and output capacities, on the one hand, and Page 304 Figure 9. 1 How the human cognitive capacities, as ordinarily construed, map onto the human information-processing capacities.&quot;[Von Eckardt, Barbara *What is cognitive science?*.

<li>&quot;Consider two photos of the young and the old Einstein. What makes them similar?They occupy proximate positions in one&#x27;s facial state space. Finally, let us turn to a motor example, and let us consider one&#x27;s &quot;body image&quot;: one&#x27;s continuously updated sense of one&#x27;s overall bodily configura- w Representation and computation in neural networks STEP CYCLE: 357 FELINE HIND LEG SKELETAL STATE SPACE Figure 11 tion in space. That configuration is constituted by the simultaneous position and tension of several hundreds of muscles, and one monitors it all quite successfully, to judge from the smooth coordination of most of one&#x27;s movements.&quot;[(editor), Derek Partridge, and Yorick Wilks (editor) *The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence: A Sourcebook*. annotated edition. Cambridge University Press, 1990.]</li>
<li>&quot;In VMRs, as in PPRs, there is an implicit tie between seeing something and acting on it, like in seeing the shape of a stick and gearing the motion of the arm in its direction and the grip of the 1 This is, actually, what Dretske thinks too [4, chap. 2]. neither primary qualities (like shape, size, motion) nor secondary qualities (like colours or sounds), according to the classical lockian-galileian distinction, Gestalt psychologists used to called them also third properties [11, chap. 8].

<li>&quot;I have coined the term &#x27;broad information-processing capacity&#x27; to refer to the extended input-output sequences in which narrow information-processing capacities are embedded. Thus, a broad, input information-processing capacity takes as input a distal physical stimulus and yields as output a representational state, whereas a broad, output information-processing capacity takes as input a representational state and yields as output a motor movement with certain characteristic environmental consequences.&quot;[Von Eckardt, Barbara *What is cognitive science?*. MIT Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;One might show that one’s technique reliably registers reliable artifacts known to be produced under aberrant causal conditions. One might rely on a theoretical understanding of the mechanism by which the detection technique works. One might check the results of one’s technique against another technique that relies on causally independent mechanisms (see Franklin 2009). In each of these cases, one relies on knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the system and in the detection technique to argue that the methods in question provide an adequate measure of E in these circumstances.&quot;[Hsiang-Ke Chao, Szu-Ting Chen, and Roberta L. Millstein *Mechanism and Causality in Biology and Economics*. Springer Netherlands : Imprint : Springer, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;And this is so in spite of any effort to shorten distances between the notion of information and the notion of point of view. Even if we adopt a very general and wide-ranging notion of information, according to which it is possible to speak of things as the non-conceptual information linked to analogical representations, and we assume that points of view have a certain informational structure, points of view cannot be reducible to information. They cannot be reducible to information because points of view include many components which are not reducible to information.&quot;[Magnani, Lorenzo *Model-based reasoning in science and technology : theoretical and cognitive issues*. Springer, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Garfinkel’s alternative theory not only casts information in a new light, but also promises to clarify the role of Ethnomethodology (EM) and Conversation Analysis (CA) in contemporary detailed studies of the workplace—and also to highlight strengths and limitations of existing approaches to information— thereby more adequately grounding current research and design efforts. 4 By the early 1950s—when Garfinkel did this work at Princeton—the information age had ushered in a new focus on information, the design and 3.&quot;[Garfinkel, Harold, and Anne Rawls (ed.) *Toward a Sociological Theory of Information*.
