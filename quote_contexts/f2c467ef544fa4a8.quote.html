<li>&quot;If one used a flow rate of 26 occ/min/unit, a single 1100 mm (44 in) stair could serve 2160 people (4320 for two stairs) and a 1400 mm (56 in) stair could serve 2750 people (5500 for two stairs). This would be the total number of occupants served by the stair(s) on all floors except those with direct egress to the outside (who would not use the stairs).&quot;[Bukowski, Richard W. *Emergency Egress From Buildings*.

<li>&quot;Galea et al. (2009) reported occupants stopping to allow others to pass them. Other studies (i. e. , Frantzich 1996; Ye et al. 2008) observed some occupants engaging in passing behavior, but did not indicate how the dynamics occurred. 26 3. 16 3 Additional Variables Merging Three different types of merging are possible.

<li>&quot;34, para. 6, sent. 2 of the MBO specifies that stairs must be fitted with handrails on both sides and intermediate handrails where this is necessary for safety reasons. However, some federal state building regulations stipulate this for stairs in buildings with more than two dwellings reached via stairs. If stepless access (i. e. ramp or lift) to these dwellings is not possible, the use of the stairs by older occupants should be made safer and more comfortable by providing a handrail on both sides.&quot;[Heiss, Oliver *Barrier-Free Design*.

<li>&quot;The likelihood of the agents to wait in a queue is determined by their patience coefficient. The model permits to represent the interactions between horizontal and vertical components. Stairs in STEPS There are two different methods to simulate stairs in STEPS. A possible method is the use of the stair menu (see Fig. 4. 24). This menu permits to define the geometric characteristics of the stairs (e. g. , width, height, handrails, walking side, etc.&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;This option indicates that the capacity for stairs in NFPA 130 is used for stairs over or under 4 % of slope in the up or down direction. Users can also modify this default setting with the desired flows and speeds through stairs. An alternative method is the definition of a plane with the shape of the stair under consideration. This method is particularly effective when the shape of the stair is not conventional (e. g. , spiral stairs).&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*.

<li>&quot;Stairs Semicircular stairs nestled between walls of foundation skirting is an excellent feature for distinguishing a fairly undistinguished deck. This small, gray dining deck also features natural wood railings with glass inserts, but it’s the stairs that set a truly sophisticated tone. This is why choosing stair style is always a part of a good deck design—they should never be an afterthought Stair configuration goes far in determining how the deck is perceived.&quot;[Peterson, Chris *Deck ideas you can use: creative deck designs for every home &amp; yard*.

<li>&quot;port all the weight the stairs will take, but with the addition of the blocks, the stair will be strong enough. Put it in place and fasten it securely. After reading the above, you may well decide to hire an expert to build all the stairs in your house. That might be a good idea, but you probably could manage the basement stairs, and if you can build them, you can make the main stairs.&quot;[Freeman, Mark *The Solar Home: How to Design and Build a House You Heat With the Sun (How-To Guides)*.

<li>&quot;How dull, in contrast, are intact stairs who stand with ease, paying no attention to the perfect state of their matter. Such stairs rise despite their steps. The function transcends the material. The material is instrumental to an overriding activity that pursues its goal without noticeable difficulty. A flight of stairs is but of fleeting interest, unless it is a new and remarkable form.&quot;[Ginsberg, Robert *The Aesthetics of Ruins: Illustrated by the Author*. Rodopi, 2004.]</li>
