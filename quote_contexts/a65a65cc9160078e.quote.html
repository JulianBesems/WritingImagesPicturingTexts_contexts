      <li>&quot;Some of the useful working criteria for assessing possible body art depicted on (apparently) human figurines include the positive/negative correlation between ornament and anatomical shapes, as well as the appearance of individual symbols and designs on places like the face, which are unlikely to have been covered by cloth (see figs. 9. 3a and 9. 4e).

<li>&quot;Earthenware vessel with modeled net ornament (Toscanella) The more a form is aesthetically satisfying in itself, the less it will need the  aid of ornamental attributes for the completion and fulfillment of its expression. Ornaments, however, are often needed to correct a certain indeterminateness or even transgressions of the limits of pure form, or to bring into  sonorous accord those dissonances that are unavoidable, even inevitable, in  high artistic endeavors. Just as the luxuriant abundance of a youthful head  of hair becomes even more attractive when restrained and confined with a  golden net, a bulging vessel will seem even larger but also more secure when  ornamented with a braided pattern. &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The progression of materials and designs in artificial hip technology might be seen simply as the progressive, linear refinement of increasingly better-functioning devices—examples, in other words, of technical rationality in action. The shape and composition, however, of particular technologies might always have been different. Indeed, as this account demonstrates, the material development of artificial hips continues to be shaped by different forces of innovation in the context of contemporary orthopedics.&quot;[Ott, Katherine, David Serlin, and Stephen Mihm *Artificial Parts, Practical Lives: Modern Histories of Prosthetics*. NYU Press, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;The principle involves producing a number of thumbnail sketches in silhouette of the subject you wanted to design, but not limited to only that specific thing. Such an approach strips away thought processes that might get mired early on in sticky detail or specific design issues, instead boiling the design down to simple black shapes or outlines. I thought this might be an interesting way to approach this task, so I filled a few sheets with scribbles and semi-random shapes.&quot;[Crossley, Kevin *Character Design from the Ground Up*. ILEX, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;As in maps, sections are marked off with topographic features. Trees, used illusionistically in local instances, also function schematically within the frieze as a compositional whole—part of the visual formula to mark divisions and distances. Burgkmair thus melded groupings that might well delineate moments of experienced reality with pictorial elements meant to function schematically. These “pictographs” work in tandem with the blocks of text, which dwindle into ever briefer captions in later editions of Burgkmair’s frieze. 60 The headlining toponym IN GENNEA mimics the discursive space of mappaemundi that simultaneously accommodate titular logographs as well as pictographs.&quot;[(auth.), Stephanie Leitch *Mapping Ethnography in Early Modern Germany: New Worlds in Print Culture*. Palgrave Macmillan US, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The Scribes lose track of that, even though they seem to be able to record and measure everything else. We Antiquarians and the Thespians, both interested in aesthetics, ally in such matters as the meaning and purpose of Art- though the Thespians are shy about criticizing the Scribes too seriously. The Antiquarians get along well with the Engineers, since they both deal with physical objects. The Fraternities stick to their respective spheres of cataloguing/replicas, and repair/grand design.&quot;[Adams, Chris, Liz Holliday, Sean Jaffe, Barbara Manui, David Fooden, and Brian Ward *CONTINUUM: Roleplaying in The Yet*. ADC, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;Iconologists often call the process by which two icons come to have the same symbols but different meanings “pseudomorphosis” or even (to imply an even more dramatic transposition of meanings and styles) “synthomorphosis. ”38 Classical examples of pseudomorphosis came from medieval or Renaissance art, where, for example, Father Time figures with Saturn’s attributes and blind putti recall ancient Cupids. But cases of pseudomorphosis were common in modern art as well.&quot;[Viano, Francesca Lidia *Sentinel: The Unlikely Origins of the Statue of Liberty*. Harvard University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;The domes- ticity of the former is supposedly non-monumental, the latter by definition embodies everything that monumentalism represents: an unexpected proportion or scale, great public resonance, power, oppressiveness, and even an element of fear. The differences can also be expressed, according to one recent critic, by asserting that the domestic building ‘suggests heimlichheit (homeliness), which in turn implies that monuments might be unheimlich, or uncanny: the disturbing or worrying are themselves among the qualities which might be considered monumental’.&quot;[Worpole, Ken *Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;When the object is seen from certain angles, the modifications and the scroll on the support reveal the fundamental symbols, the S-motif and the triskelion, as well as fleeting suggestions of human heads, with or without double mistletoe leaves, and possibly even animals.&quot;[Kruta, Venceslas *Celtic Art*. Tra. Phaidon Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Thus medieval pottery’s most important inventions and more significant  products usually served immediate architectural purposes, which places them  in other sections of this book. Examples include flagstone floors, terra-cotta  paneling, glazed colored roof tiles, even building bricks and beautiful medieval stove tiles. Still, the Middle Ages were not lacking in truly artistic pottery. It had survived as a respected force and had even gained new impetus, chiefly in the  Orient among the Arabs and Moors, and also in Byzantium, even though  architecture also extended its dominant influence to this field as well. &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;There is no denying the seductive beauty of the firm&#x27;s later ornament. Often compared with that of Louis Sullivan, it beguiled Cram as much as it does us today. But in a very real sense it also corrupted Cram, who, had he persevered on his own, might well have evolved a characteristic personal detail that, while it would not likely have been compared to Sullivan&#x27;s, might have been to Wright&#x27;s or Lutyens&#x27;s. Similarly, the various watercolor renderings by Cram reproduced here document that Ralph Adams Cram on his own was not only capable of good architectural detail but was as well a gifted renderer.&quot;[Shand-Tucci, Douglass, and Ralph Adams Cram *Boston Bohemia, 1881-1900: Ralph Adams Cram--Life and Architecture*. University of Massachusetts Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;Peripheral and Incidental Details of the Act of Theft It might be of value to go back to the theft just described for a moment to see a few of the possibilities or variants in the pattern which such a mob as we are describing might have encountered. For example, when the tool located the okus o r leather, we assume that it was a conventional-type billfold; “She had the okus topped, but she didn’t pull it, as she made the fuzz and didn’t even rumble the mark. ” It might well have been any one of a number of other types of pocketbook; these will be taken up separately in the chapter Money and Valuables.&quot;[MAURER, DAVID W. *WHIZ MOB A Correlation of the Technical Argot of Pickpockets with Their Behavior Pattern*.

<li>&quot;Conceptual art, particularly, has freed photogra¬ phers from the classic requirements of a finely-made print of a single image as an end in itself. As a result, artists have begun to explore new ways of presenting information; in the case of art aimed at exploring society it might just as 10 Hans Haacke, First Panel from Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum Board ot Trustees, 1974. Reproduction courtesy of the artist. well be social science information. These new formats are well adapted to the presentation of scientific ideas and re¬ sults, even though they may not do that in the classical way.&quot;[Becker, Howard S. *Exploring Society Photographically*. Mary &amp; Leigh Block Gallery, 1981.]</li>
<li>&quot;According to Havelock, who, unlike Goody, failed &quot;to modify and qualify as well as expand his earlier views&quot; (Halverson 1992: 301), the alphabet was unique in its sophistication and potential. For the first time it permitted a &quot;wealth of detail,&quot; &quot;depth of psychological feeling,&quot; personal reflection, and even analytical abstraction (Havelock 1986: 11; Logan 1986: 20- 24) that had not been recorded before. &#x27;&quot;[Boone, Elizabeth Hill, and Walter D.

<li>&quot;In essence, does ugliness keep us human?Hopefully, the pages that follow will identify a capacious sense of ugliness to consider these questions while remaining conceptual enough to move beyond any singular cultural or historic limit – and well beyond the limits of my imagination. By defying a singular definition, ugliness might be reimagined through more minds to sense our shared cultural stake in this topic beyond its slippery and sticky surface.

<li>&quot;Black actresses from Dorothy Dandridge to Lena Horne have stories to tell of how standard Hollywood lighting has not been kind to them. 112 SECOND SKIN But Baker proves to be the exception that is instructive: far from wilting under its force, she appears to reﬂect or even absorb telescopic light itself. From her famous lacquered hair, known as the “Baker-Do,” to the expanse of gleaming skin in her studio photographs, Baker sheen is an integral part of her iconography. (In these images as well as other studio photographs, Baker’s skin is often, if not always, anointed by oils that in turn enhance, even mime, the lighting that falls on it. )&quot;[Cheng, Anne Anlin *Second Skin: Josephine Baker &amp; the Modern Surface*. Oxford University Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;For more elaborate projects – a suit of ceremonial armour with an inlaid, elaborately figured breastplate, never intended to be used in battle, commissioned for the start of a new campaign, perhaps; a set of silver candlesticks to make a wedding dowry; or the baptistry doors for Florence’s cathedral – it was different. In such circumstances the commission might involve an artist as well as a craftsman.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*. Rizzoli Ex Libris, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Such belief systems might be religious, political or social; or indeed any combination of these. In the design of cemeteries – no less than the design of parks, pleasure gardens, lidos and other public spaces (the subject-matter of that earlier book) – such belief systems sought to develop an appropriate symbolic and institutional form for these new public or quasi-public places. This the nineteenth-century secular or non-denominational European cemetery seemed to achieve. As a result, the development of well-managed and often beautiful cemeteries and burial grounds in cities became associated with ideas of progress and even social harmony.&quot;[Worpole, Ken *Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West*. 2004.]</li>

<li>&quot;Even if both designers and 262 art, sex and eugenics manufacturers considered a design to be perfect and advertised it as such in order to impress consumers, almost by definition as well as by marketing necessity, the true ‘ideal’ remained just around the corner. Design historian Jeffrey Meikle gives two superb examples of the latter situation.&quot;[Brauer, Fae, and Anthea Callen (eds.) *Art, Sex and Eugenics: Corpus Delecti*. Ashgate, 2008.]</li>

<li>&quot;Even worse, if the fish were lying on a flat surface, it would ‘take the form of that surface on one side and be bowed excessively on the other’, throwing the fins out of alignment as well. Birds proved even more difficult to measure, for their entire surface was variable depending upon the precise airflow at any particular moment. These two examples showed, the writer argued, the difficulties which ‘the scientific investigator is confronted with when he attempts to learn quantitatively just how well streamlined a bird or fish actually is’.&quot;[Brauer, Fae, and Anthea Callen (eds.) *Art, Sex and Eugenics: Corpus Delecti*.

<li>&quot;Suppose that our mysterious original builder decided to arrange his spruce platform so that it would tilt its boxes down a shaft into just such a hole. It need not, of course, have been natural and fortuitous. It could equally well have been modified, or even totally artificial. To increase the likelihood of these slide defences working, the boxes might well have been constructed above simple rollers, or had skids or primitive casters incorporated into their bases.&quot;[Fanthorpe, Lionel *The Oak Island Mystery: World’s Greatest Treasure Hunt*.
