      <li>&quot;The symbolic, as such untranslatable, while translating itself is hereby however not completely transferred into the technical. It differentiates itself in  relation to itself, i. e. it “specifies” itself in an operative model that remains  symbolic-referential. The relation of the place-value-like arrangement of the  symbolic denies itself to both itself and any definite model of its own function. This way only it becomes legible as the primary origin which enables  the origin of communication technology to be determined, i. e.&quot;[INPUT: Hovestadt and Bühlmann - 2014 - Domesticating symbols metalithikum.

<li>&quot;Not only does the network represent the sum-total of the functions and capabilities of the constituents of a given object or thing, it is also that what lends consistency — an internal consistency — to the said thing or object. In the “inter” sense (and continuing with a strain of Simondon’s work) the notion of reticularity extends between objects and things. Considered in this way, the understanding of “the network condition” (and “the networked condition”) approaches something akin to the Deleuzo-Guattarian concept of “the plane of consistency. ”19 This suggests that while our commonplace view of things and objects presumes their singularity (i. e. , their individualness) and, more often than not, gives it primary importance, such a view — in the Simondonian sense — is misplaced.&quot;[Mellamphy, Dan, Nandita Biswas Mellamphy, Babette E.

<li>&quot; 150 DOMESTICATING SYMBOLS — Metalithikum II universal meta-language. 78 Hermann Weyl has famously captured these  sentiments in statement : “In these days the angel of topology and the  devil of abstract algebra fight for the soul of each individual mathematical domain. ”79 Despite this drastic statement, Weyl was certainly  an intellectual who would have readily agreed in not condemning and  judging Leibniz’s dream of a characteristica universalis too hastily. A  rather singular voice between the two predominant camps at the time  with regard to the role of algebra for reasoning (the intuitionists and  the formalists), Weyl was eager to make explicit exactly the very same  distinction that is crucial with regard to Leibniz as well : that the universal can be systematized alphabetically both in the operative terms of  method and characteristics, and also in descriptive terms of conceptual  form and numerical bodies of rules. 80 For him, the placement of intuition  (as the natural faculty for insight) could not be decided simply in terms  of “naturally given” versus “intellectually achieved. ” Rather, together  they are irresolvable :  In the Preface to Dedekind (1888) we read that “In science, whatever is provable must not be believed without proof. ” This remark  is certainly characteristic of the way most mathematicians think.&quot;[INPUT: Hovestadt and Bühlmann - 2014 - Domesticating symbols metalithikum.

<li>&quot;Stuttgart, 1967). 118 • Chapter 2 hand, although they do show the correspondence with common usage that one would expect. In the Metaphysics we find more instructive evidence. In book 5, given over to lemmatic definitions of technical terms, Aristotle defines four uses of the designation “substance. ” The term can apply to a) an essence that is causal of a thing’s existence, as a soul is of an animal; b) a formal and universal definition; or c) a critical and limiting subpart that constitutes a sine qua non; but the most important of the definitions of substance, he says, is d) as a complete body, which he elaborates in this way: Simple bodies are called “substance”—for example earth, fire, water, and these sorts of things—and on the whole bodies and things constructed from them, both animals and demonic bodies, and their parts.&quot;[Struck, Peter T. *Divination and Human Nature: A Cognitive History of Intuition in Classical Antiquity*.

<li>&quot;Sauvé-Meyer has convincingly shown the many points in the sources at which the Stoic “chain” of fate is conceived of this way. 63 This is a system in which the horizontal interlinking of objects, each containing its forward-leaning seeds, will be the crucial way of envisioning sequences, and fate, which result from each immediately prior state. Each cause (that is, material body) fully embedded with all the other causes in the universe, will have its own internal seeds expressed through the active tenor of its pneuma.&quot;[Struck, Peter T. *Divination and Human Nature: A Cognitive History of Intuition in Classical Antiquity*.

<li>&quot;The main interest with these  languages was to make available for easy application, as a kind of toolbox of “instruments” in coded “form,” the precise way of how a certain  organizational procedure needs to be set up in order to function well. Think of SAP,14 for example. The developments in this paradigm are  driven by the fact that every step of decision can thereby be “dispersed”  into constitutive procedures, and hence, an infinitesimal limberness  can be introduced into organizational forms.&quot;[INPUT: Hovestadt and Bühlmann - 2014 - Domesticating symbols metalithikum.

<li>&quot;However, one ought to keep in mind that often what is being described is not the frame as a whole but the keying it sustains. 4 Designs and Fabrications I Keying provides one basic way in which a strip of activity can be transformed, that is, serve as an item-by-item model for something else. Differently put, keyings represent a basic way in which activity is vulnerable. A second transformational vulnerability is now considered: fabrication.&quot;[Goffman, Erving *Frame Analysis.

<li>&quot;One reason why replayings and embeddings are easy to confuse can now be recommended. In a suitable context, reference to an individual whose past statement is about to be reported appears to establish the personal perspective and temporal starting point of an anecdote, such that any quoted statement which follows can somewhat serve as the concluding part of a temporally developed two-part story, in this way providing a replaying of sorts.&quot;[Goffman, Erving *Frame Analysis.

<li>&quot;In this prior group of examples, divinatory language seems to Plato an appropriate way of describing our access to the Good. It will be Plato on Divination and Knowing • 59 oblique, not straightforward, more like the spotting of a resemblance, or a flash of insight, than a discursive calculus that moves from premises to conclusions. 19 These texts, which I have presented in a sequence of increasing weightiness of the objects known, might make tempting the conclusion that Plato uses divination to stand particularly for a way of knowing transcendent entities.&quot;[Struck, Peter T. *Divination and Human Nature: A Cognitive History of Intuition in Classical Antiquity*.

<li>&quot;In such cases often a short etymological explanation is added in order to make users aware of the fact. Note that this did not affect the placing of these characters within the CCD, as 爿 and 黑 are to be considered as radicals and 犬 as series header. It is also interesting to note that in standard Chinese dictionaries 爿 and 黑 also function as radicals in respect to these characters. d) two meaning elements In quite a number of cases neither part indicates the sound, but the character is a compound ideograph; in other words, it has two meaning elements.&quot;[Van Amstel, Adrian *Chinese Character Dictionary: A New Approach to Arranging, Explaining and Looking Up Chinese Characters*.

<li>&quot;THE FRAME ANALYSIS OF TALK 527 The cartoon world presents an even more complicated arrangement of participation statuses and warrants extended comment. Some of the figures are able to speak with each other. Typically this speaking is made available to the audience through dialogue print (as in printed plays) in the local language-in this case, English. In this way we can listen in not only on human cartoon figures but also on animal figures of various species. Incidentally, animals are often allowed to talk within and across species, sometimes beyond our own ken, in which case evidence of talk may come from undecipherable script.&quot;[Goffman, Erving *Frame Analysis.

<li>&quot;13 [Euclid 1956: vol. 1, 153 (I, Defs. 2 and 3)]. Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa) more faithfully  combines Euclid’s I, Def. 2 and 3 into one when he offers ‘Line is length lacking width, with points  as its ends’ in De practica geometrie and [Hughes 2008: 5]. This is pertinent since Alberti was well  aware of De practica geometrie; see our commentary to Problem 12 of Ludi matematici, pp. 101– 106 in this present volume. 14 [Euclid 1956: vol. 3, 260]; as Heath notes on p. 262, ‘body’ was the term used by Aristotle, so  perhaps this was Alberti’s reason for choosing it despite the fact that ‘solid’ was used by Euclid.&quot;[INPUT: Williams et al. - 2010 - The Mathematical Works of Leon Battista Alberti.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;See also the discussion which follows, in which these authors review the relevant literature. Although I will question whether the word ‘space’ is always as phenomenologically neutral as these social scientists maintain, their distinction is helpful to the extent that it signals the intermediary of a mental process by which our physical habitat is invested with significance. Space, stone, and spirit:the meaning of place 291 Like Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton, in studying the meaning of things—in this case, of places—I am concerned not merely with ascertaining the significance of objects and spaces but also how these meanings serve what for these circumstances can aptly be termed the construction of the self.&quot;[Golding, Dr Sue, and Sue Golding *The Eight Technologies of Otherness*.

<li>&quot;This is also what characterizes elegance in design: the invention that&#x27;s clever yet seems totally natural. Of course we know that they aren&#x27;t really inevitable; it&#x27;s human ingenuity that makes them seem that way, temporarily. Now consider the equation mentioned above. It&#x27;s definitely surprising; you could work with the numbers e, and i for years, each in a dozen different contexts, without realizing they intersected in this particular way. Yet once you&#x27;ve seen the derivation, you feel that this equation really is inevitable, that this is the only way things could be.&quot;[Chiang, Ted *Stories of Your Life and Others*.
