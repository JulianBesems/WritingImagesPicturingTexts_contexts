Selected: It is intensive rather than extensive space … smooth space is occupied by intensities …The creaking of ice and the song of the sands. Striated space, on the contrary, is canopied by the sky as measure.[Massumi, Brian *A Shock to Thought: Expressions After Deleuze and Guattari (Philosophy & Cultural Studies)*. 2002.]

--- Context List ---
01. "1440: The Smooth and the Striated Smooth space and striated space — nomad space and sedentary space — the space in which the war machine develops and the space instituted by the State apparatus — are not of the same nature."[Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari *A Thousand Plateaus*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2004.]

02. "In A Thousand Plateaus this whole problem is discussed under the rubric smooth and striated spaces. A smooth space is a nonmetric intensive space, ‘one of distances, not of measures’, whereas a striated space is an extensive space, with a closed, parcelled out or measured surface (Deleuze 1987: 479)."[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]

03. "See Figure 2. STRIATED SPACE [espace strié]: space marked by striae (striations); metric or measured space. Just as smooth space is the product of intensification, striated space is the product of stratification, especiallyas effectuated by the State apparatus (385; 441)."[Bonta, Mark, and John Protevi *Deleuze and Geophilosophy: A Guide and Glossary (Deleuze Connections)*. Edinburgh University Press, 2004.]

04. "14. 1440: The Smooth and the Striated Quilt Smooth space and striated space—nomad space and sedentary space—the space in which the war machine develops and the space instituted by the State apparatus—are not of the same nature."[Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari *A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia*. University of Minnesota Press, 1988.]

05. "No real space is perfectly smooth or perfectly striated. Smooth space allows for and tends to become traversed by striation, while striation enables new kinds of smoothness."[Saldanha, Arun *Space After Deleuze*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2017.]

06. "Yet the two are linked and give each other impetus. Nothing is ever done with: smooth space allows itself to be striated, and striated space reimparts a smooth space, with potentially very different values, scope, and signs."[Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari *A Thousand Plateaus*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2004.]

07. "Yet the two are linked and give each other impetus. Nothing is ever done with: smooth space allows itself to be striated, and striated space reimparts a smooth space, with potentially very different values, scope, and signs."[Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari *A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia*. University of Minnesota Press, 1988.]

08. "Homogeneous space is in no way a smooth space; on the contrary, it is the form of striated space. The space of pillars. It is striated by the fall of bodies, the verticals of gravity, the distribution of matter into parallel layers, the lamellar and laminar movement of flows."[Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari *A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia*. University of Minnesota Press, 1988.]

09. "It is intensive rather than extensive space … smooth space is occupied by intensities …The creaking of ice and the song of the sands. Striated space, on the contrary, is canopied by the sky as measure."[Massumi, Brian *A Shock to Thought: Expressions After Deleuze and Guattari (Philosophy & Cultural Studies)*. 2002.]

10. "Or, in the way we saw this articulated in "Of the Refrain," smooth space has direction while striated space has dimension. Finally, the mathematical model shows that smooth space "is constituted by an accumulation of proximities, and each accurnulation defines a zone of indiscemibility proper to 'becoluing'" (TP 488)."[Adkins, Brent *Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus: A Critical Introduction and Guide*. Edinburgh University Press, 2015.]

11. "Both AP and Ywm exemplify phantastically entwined relations between smooth and striated space. Smooth space is a boundless chaotic space of affect and sensation in which heterogeneous elements fold together, conjoin and disjoin in infinite variation."[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]

12. "Striated space is given a function, which is imparted on a subject, while smooth space allows subjects to distribute themselves within and throughout space to form a new assemblage (human-building-environment)."[*Deleuze Studies Journal* Edinburgh University Press, 2007.]

13. "‘Smooth’ space has turned into ‘striated’. A surveyable space has emerged as a composition from an overlap of vague qualitative voluminousness, singular points, and pure unextended interval."[(ed.), Rosi Braidotti, and Rick Dolphijn (ed.) *This Deleuzian Century*. Brill / Rodopi, 2015.]

14. "The term ‘striated space’ refers to a metric space, while nonmetric spaces, ‘vectorial, projective, or topological’ (ATP, 361) are referred to as ‘smooth’."[DeLanda, Manuel *Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy*. Continuum, 2005.]

15. "The second stage of effacing smooth space is to expel it from striated space. That is, striated space must be shown to be selfsubsistent, not dependent on smooth space."[Adkins, Brent *Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus: A Critical Introduction and Guide*. Edinburgh University Press, 2015.]
