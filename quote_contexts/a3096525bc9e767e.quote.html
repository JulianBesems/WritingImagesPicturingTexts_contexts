      <li>&quot;à terre [ah tehr]—On the floor; refers to movements performed with the working leg touching the floor as opposed to in the air.&quot;[Kassing, Gayle *Beginning ballet*. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Your teacher or the accompanist provides transitional music to allow groups to move in and out of the dancing space. Move across the floor. When you move across the floor either by yourself, in a line, or with a group, you must be safe and courteous. Performing as an individual, the goal is to move across the floor either in one or two repetitions of the combination.&quot;[Kassing, Gayle *Beginning ballet*. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;FLOOR Infinitely harmless, the floor Is  obliged to offer Its occupants  stability -  yet receives from  Its users systematic harshness,  If not abuse, in return. k e lle r e a s t e r lin g FLOOR PAGE 1 floor . . . once a surface for symbolic expression -  defining the way  spaces are used, implying the &#x27;rules of the game&#x27; -  floors in  the 20th century tended towards a purely Cartesian surface. . .  rational, undecorated, unloved, perfectly flat, ideally soundless-  simultaneous with our neglect of programmatic, symbolic,  and haptic potential, floor space became the dominant economic  measure of architectural space: real estate adopted a fetish  of the m2, masking the reality of the three-dimensional volume,  and the floor itself is typically a thick slab, sometimes a &#x27;false  floor&#x27; containing mysteries similar to those of the ceiling. . .&quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;extreme &quot;That in the floor I lay, as I were deed. &quot;— Chaucer, Canterbury Tales. 27 The floor is a site of the body in extremis. In tragic history plays and epics, at the point of climax,  characters must keel over or fall over backwards onto the floor. Over and over in Homer&#x27;s  Odyssey, the &quot;floors are running with blood. &quot; While kneeling and bowing are common liturgical  postures, the fully prostrate body on the floor of a giant cathedral is a stirring, ultimate signal of  submission or humility. To be &quot;floored&quot; is to be, either literally or figuratively, knocked senseless.  In these cases, in literature, it is important not just to drop into a chair, but to really fall all the way  down onto the floor. In Jane Austen&#x27;s Pride and Prejudice, when Marianne hears the truth about &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;2. 1. Structure To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. In primitive buildings, the ground may be used as the floor. In better buildings, the floor may be a deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist indicated in Fig.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;Floor-Ceiling Systems Often, for aesthetic reasons, for foot comfort, for noise control or to protect the deck from wear, afloor covering is placed atop the deck. In such cases, the deck is called a subfloor. When a floor is not placed directly on the ground; for example, when a floor extends above a room below, some means must be provided for supporting the deck in place.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;Elevators First Floor Fig. 2. 17. Stairs and floor openings. above often are referred to as a step. The steps of a stairway can be made self supporting but generally are supported on structural members. Stairs are usually provided with railings along the sides, for safety reasons. Where two floors are connected by stairs, an opening at least as wide as the stairs must be provided in the upper floor over the stairs to permit passage to that level.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;The battement extends approximately 2 to 3 inches (5-7 cm), or about 20 degrees off the floor. On the return, move the working foot through the pointed position to the floor and brush back to the full-foot position. Petit Battement Piqué [puh-TEE bat-MAHN pee-KAY] or Battement Tendu Jeté Pointe [bat-MAHN than-DEW zhuh-TAY pwen-TAY] Definition Stretched beating, thrown and pointed Purpose Uses the turned-out leg and pointed foot as a unit Develops directional acuity Description Brush the working foot off the floor in a battement dégagé.&quot;[Kassing, Gayle *Beginning ballet*.

On the Bedroom Floor (Yours or Someone Else&#x27;s) The bedroom floor, yours or someone else&#x27;s, is a great place for a quickie, Having sex on the floor always implies that you just couldn&#x27;t wait for the bed, . . . . . � JIJI &amp; BEST POSITION Missionary or Doggy Style PROS Sex on the floor adds an extra layer of excitement.&quot;[Hunt, Jennifer, and Dan Baritchi *1,001 best places to have sex in America : a when, where, and how guide*.

<li>&quot;• The floor is used for storage only • The floor is occupied by limited number of staff (no public access) • Adequate means of escape is provided - at least one stairway within 4. 5 m of a final exit from the building. • The floor is not more than 10 m in width or length and does not exceed 50% of the floor area of the space in which it is situated. • People using the storage area should be aware of any fire developing below Otherwise, the steelwork will require fire protection in order to achieve the necessary fire resistance period.&quot;[Simms, W. I., G. M. Newman, and Steel Construction Institute *Single storey steel framed buildings in fire boundary conditions*. The Steel Construction Institute, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Exceptions to this would be rooms below ground level where damp could damage the timber, rooms which were likely to be wet due to their function, eg kitchens and sculleries, and some working class terraced housing built with clay block floors or stone flags. NB For more information on timber see Chapter 11- Timber-Frame Housing. The floor (often referred to as a raised timber floor or suspended floor) consists of a series of joists supported by the loadbearing walls and covered with floorboards.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed. Estates Gazette Ltd, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;CONS It can be dangerous leaning over the railings- keep your feet on the ground!164. On the Bathroom Floor (Yours or Someone Else&#x27;s) Nothing says &quot;I want you&quot; like a raunchy quickie on the bathroom floor after a shower.&quot;[Hunt, Jennifer, and Dan Baritchi *1,001 best places to have sex in America : a when, where, and how guide*.

<li>&quot;Figure 8. 3(a)-(c) provide the illustrations. • Logical layouts must be developed which permit the escape route to follow a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, ideally without contra-movement to the final exit. Remember that three- and four-tum stairs can cope with varying heights floor to floor within a constant shaft size (Fig. 8. 3(a) and (b». Three- and four-turn stairs imply the use of steps within the landing spaces at either end.&quot;[Blanc, Alan *Internal Components*. Routledge, 1994.]</li>
