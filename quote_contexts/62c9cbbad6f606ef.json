To vectorise is to encode artefacts so that relations can be expressed as distances and neighbourhoods in a high-dimensional space. In this sense, contemporary computation introduces a geometry beyond the three-dimensional: not the geometry of solids, but of proximities, sometimes governed by explicit procedures, often emerging as probabilistic reductions. This condition is productive, but to the complexity of intuitive navigation within something we can't visualise - n-dimensions - it also comes with a risk: that translation becomes the default operation (caption \u2194 image, prompt \u2194 output), and difference is flattened into alignment.", "suggested_query": "In this sense, architecture's complexity arises from the intricate web of representations that constitute its praxis. The discipline's heterogeneity is not a weakness, but rather a strength, as it allows for a multiplicity of approaches and perspectives to coexist and inform one another. By embracing this complexity, architects can cultivate a more nuanced and responsive understanding of the built environment.", "suggest_context": "1.2.2 PROPOSAL Given the scope, and the intent of engaging with methodology over architectural material, the point being made is epistemic: architecture is mediated by many modes that do not collapse into a single model. Architectural thought does not, and never did, reside in one privileged representation, but in the proportional negotiations between several - drawings, images, texts, models - each standing apart, yet held together in practice."}
