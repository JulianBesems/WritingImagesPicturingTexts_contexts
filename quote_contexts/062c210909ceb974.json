In this sense, architectural design is not just about creating buildings, but about creating the conditions for thought to emerge. The encoding of this instrumentality is the focus of this work, which seeks to develop a computational framework for architectural design that is grounded in the theoretical, cultural, and philosophical dimensions of architectural practice. This framework will be developed through a combination of mathematical, computer scientific, and architectural theoretical methods, and will be tested through the design of a series of computational artifacts that demonstrate the possibilities of this new approach. The artifacts will be developed through a process of iterative prototyping, in which the design of each artifact will be informed by the results of previous experiments, and will be tested through a process of critical reflection and evaluation. Through this process, the work will seek to demonstrate the potential of a computational approach to architectural design that is grounded in the theoretical, cultural, and philosophical dimensions of architectural practice, and that is capable of producing designs that are not only functional and efficient, but also aesthetically pleasing and meaningful.", "suggest_context": "It does not allow for the integration of the theoretical, cultural, literary, atmospheric, philosophical and associative dimensions of architectural design or for the flexibility of the design as an idea when mediated by the designer. The consequence of this is not just representational; it is epistemic. Architecture risks forgetting how its media think. Evanss polarity, corporeal involvement versus disembodied abstraction, maps neatly onto our contemporary dilemma . The profession has excelled at the first the tangible model and its deliverables, while the second abstraction as mediating intelligence remains under-instrumentalised in computational practice. The challenge, then, is not to abandon the body of architecture but to recover its disembodied capacities as operations that relate unlike domains such as drawing, narrative, atmosphere, code, without collapsing them into sameness. Therefore the thinking of architectural modes of media is proposed to be brought into the computational before we can consider how it can be returned onto architecture itself. In contrast to the computational model in architecture, In digital contexts, space need not be a three-dimensional container at all, but an n-dimensional arrangement of features where relations are learned as proximities and projections. The crucial step is the encoding that makes such spaces operable, an encoding that can and will argue should include cultural and contextual signals beyond 3D material geometry. umbrella In Writing Images and Picturing Texts the response is aimed at finding an active manner of navigating these encodings. Throughout attempting to instrumentalise a shift from translation one-to-one sameness across media to projection and proportion calibrated relations that keep differences productive. It treats the persistent difference between text and image not as an error to be eliminated but as an architectonic obstacle that can structure thoughtakin to the way perspective constructs a view by lawful distortion. Throughout we will rely on machine learning to establish projections between domains, with emphasis on the non-linear but contingent nature of such projections, while resisting the temptation to align away difference Methodologically, the work draws on mathematics, computer science, and architectural theory to prototype alternative encodings and projections: algebraic rather than merely logicist; communicative rather than solely procedural. This stance situates architectural computation within a broader, contemporary paradigm of communication and self-organisation. The instrumentality of the thesis, writing as device, device as writing, follows a lineage of informational instruments that articulate libraries, images, and concepts into operable constellations. The immediate concern is not to predict architecture from data, but to restore architectonic play between media: a space where theory, atmosphere, culture, and association can once again act with design, rather than after it."}
