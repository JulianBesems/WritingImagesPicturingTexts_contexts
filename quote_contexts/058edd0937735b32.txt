02. "The primary concern of this text is space planning, not design presentation. Despite this, the language of space planning is the floor plan, and its graphic qualities cannot be entirely ignored. One of the premises of the planning methodology presented here is that the transition from the rough floor plan to the preliminary or presentation floor plan is part of the planning process, not just a graphic refinement."[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed.

04. "These added drawing elements make for more easily read and communicative floor plans. Consistency in technique and strong communicative drawings are essential to the success of all designers, students and professionals alike. Refining the Rough Plan The development of the rough floor plan, as described in Chapter 6, suggests significant review and evaluation within the plan development process."[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed.

06. "2. 1. Structure To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. In primitive buildings, the ground may be used as the floor. In better buildings, the floor may be a deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist indicated in Fig."[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

07. "The strategic use of colour inside, or even the total absence of it, for example, is clearly one of the resources most often used by decorators to point out to specific architectural features within the space. Furniture planning in detail controls the size of the interior space relative to the human scale."[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*. Design Media Publishing Ltd, 2011.]

08. "Floor-Ceiling Systems Often, for aesthetic reasons, for foot comfort, for noise control or to protect the deck from wear, afloor covering is placed atop the deck.

09. "Figure 4 shows that the expressions contained in the seismic provisions of the UBC 1997 and ASCE/SEI 7-10 to determine floor accelerations for the design of nonstructural components are representative of the floor acceleration envelope. The term Ai /Ag represents the amplification of the floor acceleration with respect to the peak ground acceleration, and the term hi /hr represents the floor height divided by the roof height."[Lynn, Abraham C., and Robert Reitherman *AEI 2011 : building integration solutions : proceedings of the 2011 Architectural Engineering National Conference, March 30-April 2, 2011 Oakland, California*.

10. "The walls are a large “plane. ” The sofa is a large “plane. ” The floor coverings and floor are large planes. My apartment might be a fun example to analyze . . . Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor. The walls pull from the white in the floor—a quiet “plane” in contrast with the “pop” of the painted floors."[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy & broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*.

13. "The furniture, upholstery, cushions and tables in the formal living space in the foreground, the dining area beyond it and the television corner to the left of the space are all different, but the shapes, tones and textures work together and are unified by the flooring and joinery. Different views of my dining space show how everything relates to something else and there is always another surprise for the eye – the mark of a good design is that you see something new every time you look."[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*.

19. "The inside became a landscape without rooms, and the outside started to be understood as an interior. As Le Corbusier put it: “Le dehors est toujours un dedans” (The outside is always an inside).

The MIT Press, 2007.]

20. "That said, it should be remembered that arbitrarily eliminating as many interior walls as possible will not necessarily result in a better space. While floor area and elbow room are inevitably gained, wall space is lost. This may affect the possibilities for furniture placement and storage options. Open-concept layouts are great so long as they truly correspond with the necessities at hand."[Shafer, Jay *The Small House Book*. Tumbleweed Tiny House, 2009.]

21. "Exceptions to this would be rooms below ground level where damp could damage the timber, rooms which were likely to be wet due to their function, eg kitchens and sculleries, and some working class terraced housing built with clay block floors or stone flags. NB For more information on timber see Chapter 11- Timber-Frame Housing. The floor (often referred to as a raised timber floor or suspended floor) consists of a series of joists supported by the loadbearing walls and covered with floorboards."[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.
