    <pre>If something is put through computation, with the Turing machine as the archetypical machine, it must be encoded. Represented as 1s and 0s. Flattened into the binary. This however does not *necessarily* mean the artefact is flattened in itself; the flattening becomes an issue when the encoding is treated as a definition of the object. This could be the case with the 3D model and the digital twin if architecture is presumed to have *become* the model, totally represented through its geometric and informational surrogate. In the same fashion, any one perspective image through Alberti’s technics of perspective becomes, in its communication, a flattened index. But the art of architecture is that the comprehension of space exists through the proportion between different modes of communication. This is also why Ada Lovelace remains a key reference point. Her insight for the potential of numerical encoding to offer another space to think in. One that remains an instrument, but not a predetermined one. The thesis keeps the binary substrate (1s and 0s) in view as an addressing system: a condition for operations.</pre>

      <li>&quot;The difficulty with an image of a prototype is that it is computationally nonefficacious: it does not meet the demands of object shape identification laid out as criteria 1-4 in the previous section.

<li>&quot;8. 5 Concluding Comments, Remaining Puzzles More puzzles than answers remain. Although it seems clear that objects can be represented in terms of very different geometric descriptions (for different purposes), it remains unclear just what the status of these descriptions is, with respect to at least four different issues. First, what is the status of these descriptions with respect to dividing up spatial language?If detailed shape is really a function of the &quot;what&quot; system, whereas coarse shape is a function of the &quot;where&quot; system, then we might see direct repercussions in different portions of spatial language.&quot;[P., Bloom, Peterson M.A., Nadel L., and Garret M.F. (eds.) *Language and Space*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;In these cases, expressing the location in text rather than images may allow for a more economical message (less panels), but may lead the content of each domain to convey different aspects of meaning, and thereby require the integration of novel information across multiple sources (e. g. , Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 2002). A related process occurs in the substitutive example in Fig. 7b, since the Peak is represented by text instead of an image. Other examples of absorption are discussed at length by Stainbrook (2003, 2015) who describes how surface cohesive relations between images and text contribute toward a holistic mental model of a multimodal discourse (e. g. , van Dijk &amp; Kintsch, 1983), and comparable notions are echoed in Painter et al. ’s (2012) discussion of text or images ‘‘committing” different amounts to a global meaning.&quot;[INPUT: Cohn - 2016 - A multimodal parallel architecture A cognitive framework for multimodal interactions.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Are the systems in question diﬀerent only by their way of deﬁning one and the same ‘mathematical reality’ proposed as a model in one case or the other?Or on the contrary do they translate a change of model corresponding to a profound change of the linguistic ‘content’?In this matter, the mathematician can shed no more light on the debate than the following observation. The notion of isomorphism (thus also of automorphism) — meaning a biunique correspondence compatible with the operations and relations — this precious and fecund notion can no longer be applied when S1 and S2 have diﬀerent structures, even if one has reasons to   André Lentin think that these systems proceed from some ‘same mathematical object’.&quot;[(Ed.), Bruce E. Nevin, and Stephen M. Johnson (Ed.) *The Legacy of Zellig Harris: Language and Information into the 21st Century, Vol. 2: Mathematics and Computability of Language*. Amsterdam; Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;A selection process is performed by means of suitable ‘cognitive schemas’ (or gestalts, e. g. up/down, figure/ground, force, etc. ), which carve visual presentations according to principles of mental organization and optimize the perceptual effort” [1]. Besides cognitive schemas, conceptual primitives have also been studied: in particular, [40] applied Hayes’ naı̈ve physics theory [22] to build an event logic. Within the adopted common sense principles, we can mention (i) substantiality (objects generally cannot pass through one another); (ii) continuity (objects that diachronically appear in two locations must have moved along the connecting path); (iii) ground plane (ground acts as universal support for objects).&quot;[Oltramari, Alessandro, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin (auth.), Alessandro Oltramari, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin, and Eduard Hovy (eds.) *New Trends of Research in Ontologies and Lexical Resources: Ideas, Projects, Systems*.

<li>&quot;Once again, one should not confuse the computational complexity that arises, normally in some mathematical limit, for a system of use (a performance matter) with whether complexity determines the design of the system of knowledge (a consideration about competence). Suppose one were to show that, as a class of alternative derivational objects that enters a computation grows, one cannot reach a computational decision about the optimality of the chosen derivation in polynomial time, or even in realistic time.&quot;[Uriagereka, Juan *Derivations: Exploring the Dynamics of Syntax (Routledge Leadinglinguists)*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;The latter is our focus in this chapter. There is also a practical reason to develop computational simulations of the mechanisms that implement one’s phenomena of interest. When one builds a model simulation of the underlying mechanisms of a cognitive process, one should expect to learn something from it. Simply fitting a model to preexisting data, and stopping there, merely serves as an existence proof. It shows that, among the many ways that a computational process could implement the phenomena of interest, this is one of them.&quot;[Heredia, Roberto R., Jeanette Altarriba, and Anna B. Cieślicka (eds.) *Methods in Bilingual Reading Comprehension Research*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;At the same time, Kant’s unsatisfactory treatment of ‘image’ and its non-visual, nonverbal relations has been subsumed under the schematic. The relationship between linguistic directional schemata and non-verbal sign systems, then, is one of different schemata complementing one another. Accordingly, meaning can be defined as the linking process between the schemata of language and those of non-verbal sign systems. Since we are not able to talk about non-signified objects, what remains of Kant’s theory is a field of schematic significations which permits further significations at various levels of dematerialization or formalization.&quot;[Ruthrof, Horst *Pandora and Occam: on the limits of language and literature*. Routledge, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;N. Cohn / Cognition 146 (2016) 304–323 311  (Fig. 5d). Again, this sequence shows the same semantic components as in Fig. 5a–c, only changed in format. The visuals still provide a context for the text, and each image could just as well be replaced by ‘‘Woman” and ‘‘Man” to round out the ‘‘screenplay/ Internet chat” format (though, this would result in Autonomy, not Dominance). These varying representations may affect a reader differently on some level of attention or emotion, and they certainly alter the pacing of how meaning is presented (McCloud, 1993; Wang, Hu, Hengeveld, &amp; Rauterberg, 2014), and likely result in different processing in terms of memory, information load, etc.&quot;[INPUT: Cohn - 2016 - A multimodal parallel architecture A cognitive framework for multimodal interactions.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;One could also imagine that a species that had chosen (3a) over (3d) as a collapsing technique might equally well have evolved a parser and an acquisition device for the relevant structures (but see Weinberg 1999). Third, one can shrug one’s shoulders. So what if (3a) and (3d) are equally harmonic?Two equally valid solutions exist, so pick the one that does the work.&quot;[Uriagereka, Juan *Derivations: Exploring the Dynamics of Syntax (Routledge Leadinglinguists)*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Here we have to show that one and the same expression is ruled by different semantic limits in different formations. On the various rungs of a ladder of discourse ‘satisfies,’ for instance, takes on several meanings, some ruled by definition, as in formal semantics, and others loosely guided by intersemiotic negotiation. (3) Within each linguistic regularity, as for instance the discourse on postmodern architecture, we find different discursive politics which likewise shift the curbs on semantic drift.&quot;[Ruthrof, Horst *Pandora and Occam: on the limits of language and literature*. Routledge, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Likewise, art’s metaphors rely on features in common to devices and their referent. Often the use runs counter to standard uses of the devices, as, for example, Figure 25 . 2 has shapes of straight spokes of a wheel playfully altered. Five wheels are shown. One suggests a wheel in steady spinning motion, one shows a static wheel, one a wobbly wheel, one a wheel in jerky motion, one a wheel spinning too fast to make out, and one a wheel with its brakes on.&quot;[Jr., Raymond W. Gibbs *The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought*. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;There are problems of logic and there are problems of communication. The logical difficulties can be expressed more formally by saying that so long as an axiom in system S 1 can be deduced only within a system S2 which itself includes axioms not deducible within S2&#x27; our reasoning, if it is not to be circular (i. e. making S 1 and S 2 reciprocally validate one another), must be linear and point to an infinite regress back to the original One - but to know that would entail knowledge of a system logically prior to the One, or identity with the One, which is absurd, at least as concerns human reason.&quot;[(auth.), Julius A. Elias *Plato’s Defence of Poetry*. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 1984.]</li>
<li>&quot;In the desired framework, visual intelligent systems should be able to reconstruct a “story” from basic information, blending relevant visual data with common-sense knowledge into a unifying conceptual pattern. Adopting an architectural perspective, implementing this capability would require three different strata of information elaboration: basic optical features (low-level), object detection (mid-level) and event classification (high-level). In this contribution we focus on high-level mechanisms and contents, namely the core visual intelligence as opposed to state-of-the-art machine vision.&quot;[Oltramari, Alessandro, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin (auth.), Alessandro Oltramari, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin, and Eduard Hovy (eds.) *New Trends of Research in Ontologies and Lexical Resources: Ideas, Projects, Systems*.
