The manipulation of openings and the distribution of light through a building's layout can create a sense of depth, visual interest, and even emotional resonance. Furthermore, the interplay between light and structure can also be used to convey a sense of hierarchy or spatial relationships, as different levels of light can be used to define areas of varying importance.", "suggest_context": "The meaning of the wall is just as diverse as the uses of vertical surface can be, but there are at least two essential functions: providing structure and dividing space. Practically, however, the two modes of action are always in some sort united. The signicance of a walls threshold qualities notwithstanding, a wall is empirically also a screen, or cover; Openings must be made through these abutments for the areas to communicate with each other, and to diminish the surfaces in contact. From this perspective, structure is potentially an important architectural element  both as a source of light, where light passes through it or illuminates it, and also as controller of how and where light enters a space. When stone and masonry load-bearing wall construction dominated previous periods of architectural history, openings for light could be considered the absence of structure. It illustrates structures dual roles, as both a source and modifier of light, and introduces a number of different strategies designers use to maximize the ingress of light into buildings. Chapter 9 reflects on the symbolic and representational roles structure plays. Hello who"}
