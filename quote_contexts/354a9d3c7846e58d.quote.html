    <pre>Fascinatingly, in the built environment, I wouldn&#x27;t say we should expect (or if you&#x27;d ask me) hope for a return of obvious decorative ornament per-se. But there is something where the technology becomes ornament, in the sense that it conveys grandure, or hosts spectacle. First through structure becoming decorative with Rogers and Piano, Gehry, and so on, but now I think we&#x27;re past that as well. Instead the absence of structure is the decorative more, see the large span of Ishigami&#x27;s table, or Nishizawa&#x27;s Naoshima museum, which very silently is the largest shell structure: decoration through absence. The purity of the surface without anything else. So here the surface has internalised the ornamentation beyond the visibly identifiable, but in it&#x27;s own content.</pre>

<li>&quot;It highlights the potential sexiness of the dress, which through being merely suggested and then immediately withdrawn, comes across as all the more enticing and addictive. Helmut Lang’s fashion work shows skin at the expense of ﬁgure. It plays upon the theme of fabric as second skin. The received view of the sexiness of clothes rests upon an intentional exposure of skin as a clearly deﬁned part of a clearly silhouetted ﬁgure. Clothes make people sexy by imparting signiﬁcance to what is otherwise sensually meaningless, by transferring bare ﬂesh into a code.&quot;[Vinken, Barbara *Fashion Zeitgeist: Trends and Cycles in the Fashion System*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;The appearance of the skin is a common focus in societies around the world. Clear, clean, healthy skin is considered beautiful in many cultures, but many other cultures use body paint to make people more beautiful, powerful, or to convey important social information about the person. Artificially lightened skin is considered attractive in many cultures, especially where light skin is associated with the upper classes, and dark skin with working people. For that reason, one of the 17:2 GGBD118C0C GR3695/DeMello July 31, 2007 COSM ETICS 83 earliest forms of makeup found in many stratified societies is white face powder.&quot;[DeMello, Margo *Encyclopedia of Body Adornment*.

<li>&quot;It would be hard for western eyes to understand change in surface design as a fashion change, as western eyes are trained to read fashion change as change in shape. If shape and eroticism are connected in western fashion, there must be other ways of showing eroticism in fashion systems that are not about change in shape. A fourth way of looking at fashion is that it is fueled by identity ambivalence which leads to identification with groups.&quot;[Cliffe, Sheila *The Social Life of Kimono: Japanese Fashion Past and Present*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;When in the autumn of 1785 a newspaper reported that a balloon was filled ‘in front of a large concourse of persons of fashion’, it used that term without distinction of sexes. 5 The word ‘persons’ also blurs a distinction between bodies and clothes: like celebrities in jeans, persons of fashion might be fashionable regardless of what they wore. On the other hand, expensive clothes – what eighteenth-century people called ‘rich’ dress – confer fashionable status. And what we might call style could create fashion, even when it was expressed through sartorial minimalism.&quot;[Brant, Clare *Balloon Madness: Flights of Imagination in Britain, 1783-1786*. Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Ugly touch can be as deep as environmental fracking or skin cutting, as superficial as spilled food or outdated fashion. 145 This breadth moves ‘ugly’ touch beyond fingers and hands to involve the entire human body. Fashion offers a shape-shifting aspect of ugly touch. Covering many parts of the body, clothes have touched many humans in ugly ways. Beyond serving a functional purpose (such as for climate considerations or professional attire), fashion can derive from aesthetic exploration or cultural tradition.&quot;[Henderson, Gretchen E. *Ugliness: A Cultural History*. Reaktion Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;The construction of a divide among people based on having or not having fashion may appear ridiculous at face value, but setting the “having” or “not having” of fashion as a cultural marker has allowed for the construction of otherness with a very wide scope (Niessen 2003). If the others are seen as outside the fashion system, then they are viewed as people without change/progress, taste/style, preferences/dislikes, and so on. Those said not to have fashion are denied the basic human impulse to decorate the body.&quot;[Welters, Linda, and Abby Lillethun *Fashion History: A Global View*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;Mapping is a motif frequently invoked in writing on gender, race, and performance—skin as a text provides a particular type of terrain. Skin, as a tactile organ, is also a means of communication. One of the reasons that skin is such a rich site to explore, we believe, or one of the reasons that artists use skin, is that skin “signs” are coded in different ways, and sometimes in more ambiguous ways than traditional literary texts. Skin can be visually perceived as can any map, yet it can also be touched and penetrated.&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;These definitions show that fashion involves styles and ways of dressing confined to a moment in time and space. Fashion is both temporal and geographical. Fashion is often associated with modernity, as we shall see in later discussions. It is a sign that a people, a place is current, of the moment, up with the times, and thus it is a social expression. The OED illustrates the temporal nature of fashion with a 1739 example: “Taste and fashion with us have always had wings. ” One of the OED’s definitions associates fashion with “the upper circles of society,” which sheds light on interpretations of fashion among some academics.&quot;[Welters, Linda, and Abby Lillethun *Fashion History: A Global View*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;Designs became smaller throughout the period and settled near the hem line. They also, in some cases, disappear onto the inside of the kimono. People made necessity a virtue and came to enjoy stripes, cottons, and simple monotone stenciling, which they brought to high fashion. Even clothing that originated in bath wear or farming wear becomes a part of urban high fashion. Fashion diffusion did not occur in a top-down direction, as lower-class people imitating their betters became prohibited by law. There was trickle across diffusion, as the classes were strictly separate, so a love of stenciling or stripes spread first through the merchant classes.&quot;[Cliffe, Sheila *The Social Life of Kimono: Japanese Fashion Past and Present*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Hazlitt (1818) says that fashion became a “mere affectation on one side, and gradually ceased to be made a matter of aristocratic assumption on the other” (p. 54). In this argument, fashion is a moral issue. Beauty and truth are virtue, and therefore, once fashion becomes mere imitation, anyone, even the lowest, can assume “airs and graces of pretended superiority” (p. 56). To Hazlitt, increased participation in the fashion system removes the ability 69 Fashioning Identity to distinguish class distinctions and refinement.&quot;[Johnson, Kim K. P., Susan J. Torntore, and Joanne B. Eicher *Fashion Foundations: Early Writings on Fashion and Dress*. Berg Publishers, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;In some Melanesian cultures, Strathern writes, dry, flaky skin in men is attributed to a shortage of semen. This stems from the belief that semen is stored beneath the surface of the skin, and that sex saps a man’s strength. According to Strathern, how healthy, or otherwise, a man’s skin might be is directly related to the state of his sexual relationships. Promiscuity or wantonness will result in ‘bad’ skin — a reflection not only of his physical health but also of his morals. I’m not sure everyone who suffers from a chronic skin condition would appreciate such parallels being drawn between their skin and their moral state, but it is interesting to see that 110 Unclean, Unclean regard for the personal nature of skin is cross-cultural. Chronic skin disease is often frustratingly resistant to treatment. Wilful and unpredictable, conditions like eczema and psoriasis may fail to respond to medical treatment, and then for no identifiable reason disappear — only to reappear without warning.&quot;[Cuskelly, Maryrose *Original Skin: Exploring the Marvels of the Human Hide*. Counterpoint, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Readers seem to accept the idea that fashion dictates and they must obey. There is even a kind of expectation that they will be steered. If nude is the season’s colour, then more people walk around in light, flesh-toned clothes. Fashion purports to have the final say on how people should look at any given moment, and people accept its conclusions. They act as if fashion’s answer is always right. The Flowers’ Festival (1914) by the Swedish author and artist Elsa Beskow tells the story of young Lisa, a girl invited to take part in the flowers’ great midsummer celebration.&quot;[Arntzen, Mari Grinde, and Kerri Pierce *Dress Code : The Naked Truth About Fashion*. Tra. London, UK: Reaktion Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Or even earlier, in tenth-century Japan, in Heiankyô a term of praise was to say something was ‘‘imayo okashii,’’ up to date. If you wore certain clothes with a certain range of colors, that might be in fashion, and the next season it would be no longer up to date. So there’s fashion-oriented behavior, even in so-called traditional cultures. At the same time, a lot of people in subcultures today tend to think that what they’re wearing is not fashion, that is, it might be antifashion, or outside of fashion.&quot;[Goodlad, Lauren M. E., and Michael Bibby (eds.) *Goth: Undead Subculture*. Duke University Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Fashion is a seductive and distracting force, driving the self to abandon itself to the lures of the world. But it is in relation to the sexes that the power of division worked by fashion is at its most effective and its most complex. Fashion divides, but it also, uncannily, erases the division of the sexes, and then ostentatiously displays the traces of the division that once was there. Constantly marking, erasing and transgressing borders, fashion withdraws itself from orderly social categories, makes for a disturbance, creates excitement and anxiety.&quot;[Vinken, Barbara *Fashion Zeitgeist: Trends and Cycles in the Fashion System*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;‘Shedding one’s skin’ is both an image of growth and of re-invention, and yet skin, quixotically, is also a symbol of intransigence. The rhetorical question posed in Jeremiah 13:23, ‘Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard change his spots?’ makes the point that one accustomed to doing evil is unlikely to alter their behaviour and do good. To be comfortable in your own unchangeable skin is to be at ease with the person you have become: your metaphorical 8 Skin skin ‘fits like a glove’, and you wear your imperfections and idiosyncrasies lightly.&quot;[Cuskelly, Maryrose *Original Skin: Exploring the Marvels of the Human Hide*. Counterpoint, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Fashions also simplified during this period using less fabric and trimmings than had been seen in fashion over the previous 50 years. In 1915 fashion reporters noted that ostentatious dress was finished and basic beauty and the natural body would be the mark of the next era of fashion. 18 Often, periods in the midst of a silhouette shift saw the co-existence of two fashionable silhouettes. For example, both slim skirts and full skirts were fashionable in the 1910s, and as the waistline inched closer to the hips, many fashion periodicals illustrated garments with waistlines just above where they would settle in the 1920s.&quot;[Society, Litchfield Historical, Karen M. Depauw, Jessica D. Jenkins, and Michael Krass *The House of Worth: Fashion Sketches, 1916–1918*. Dover Publications, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Only in hindsight will the parents realize that they acted in tandem with many others and were in fact part of a larger wave. Perhaps they also recognize that the name reflects something about themselves or some wish they have for the child later in life. So it is when choosing an appearance – and the relationship this has to fashion. ‘Body-fashion interaction lends expression to the unconscious experience of self, both internally as part of a “selfing” process, and externally by creating an identity to present to others’, remark the researchers Boultwood and Jerrard. 1 Fashion teams up with a person’s natural identity-creation process.&quot;[Arntzen, Mari Grinde, and Kerri Pierce *Dress Code : The Naked Truth About Fashion*. Tra. London, UK: Reaktion Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;For perhaps the first time in history, architects are looking towards fashion, and in particular Japanese fashion, for ideas about structure. All three designers—Miyake, Yamamoto and Kawakubo—have asked their audience to raise their consciousness regarding fashion as a sculptural form, fashion as an instrument of conceptual meaning and nostalgia, and fashion as a cerebral, and sometimes confrontational, force that can still be both beautiful and romantic. Over the past ten years, fashion has questioned the modern aesthetic and a number of key designers say more about current global instabilities and uncertainties, and the rapid technological and social transitions, than they do about the aesthetics of fashion.&quot;[English, Bonnie *Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;An Armani person is somewhat diﬀerent from a Versace person, just as a punk might be diﬀerent from a goth. It’s a diﬀerent set of associations. These subcultural styles tended to develop outside the mainstream of either high fashion, as it’s institutionalized and created in Paris, primarily, Material Distinctions 259 and also outside the mainstream mass clothing system. But it doesn’t mean it’s outside of fashion. I mean, there are still people manufacturing, making, buying, wearing, all of these clothes.&quot;[Goodlad, Lauren M. E., and Michael Bibby (eds.) *Goth: Undead Subculture*. Duke University Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Finally, if the Baker House is meant to provide a “dress” for Baker, might we not also consider how it is also fashioning a dress for Loos himself?Not surprisingly, in addition to buildings, Loos was vitally interested in fashion. An active advocate for the Reform Dress Movement and the new freedom of the body, Loos argues in his 1902 essay “Ladies’ Fashion” for the shedding of excessive clothing for women and that the modern woman should no longer submit to the lures of “velvet and silk, ﬂowers and ribbons, feathers and paints” (“Ladies’ Fashion,”103).&quot;[Cheng, Anne Anlin *Second Skin: Josephine Baker &amp; the Modern Surface*. Oxford University Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, while Lipovetsky in The Empire of Fashion (1994) initially argued that individualism was the prime focus of fashion in the twentieth century, evidence in recent times suggests that a shift has taken place. Andrew Hill, author of ‘People Dress So Badly Nowadays’ argues that, within a postmodernist framework, ‘questions of individual identity and a reflexivity about these questions have come to be fore grounded 134 JAPANESE FASHION DESIGNERS in a way not seen in earlier eras’ (2005: 67). Reinforced throughout Hill’s text is the idea that anti-fashion, which initially challenged the conventions of fashion, has, in turn, been accepted as mainstream.&quot;[English, Bonnie *Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE “ The Beautiful People are nonviolent anarchists, constructive anarchists. They are the real breakthrough. But I have been worrying about the way they dress. It can’t be called a fashion because it’s old clothes. ” Fashion designer Mary Quant, quoted in the Guardian newspaper, 1967 BABY DOLL LOOK A vogue for “baby doll” dresses played on the very youthful look that was fashionable. Girls wore short dresses, often with puffed sleeves and the skirt gathered into a high “empire” waistline just under the bust.&quot;[Rooney, Anne *The 1950s and 1960s (Costume and Fashion Source Books)*. Chelsea House Pub (L), 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;This tradition takes alienation as a given, but is still somewhat optimistic, since it sees both language and clothing as productive of the value of humanness. Whereas for many early theologians clothes were always already corrupt (an unconscious assumption that, incidentally, still permeates a lot of thinking about fashion, if not clothing per se), some later thinkers came to understand clothes more ambivalently.&quot;[Barcan, Ruth *Nudity: A Cultural Anatomy*.
