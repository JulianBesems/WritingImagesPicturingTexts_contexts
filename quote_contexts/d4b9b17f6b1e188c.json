This metadata will be structured using a controlled vocabulary, ensuring the consistency and reusability of the data. The domains will also be linked to specific workflows, enabling the automation of certain tasks and facilitating the collaboration among team members.", "suggest_context": "3.2 DOMAINS Domains in this context are the fields of information between which the projections take place, as well as those that establish said projections.
