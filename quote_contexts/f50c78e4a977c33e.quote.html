    <h2>Search text used</h2>
    <pre>Another attitude that we should discuss is the use of AI in this thesis. Given that the entire work is written within it’s own text-editor, made to use AI, I hope it is not a big surprise to say that much of this work is written in conjunction with various AI tools. And yes chatGPT was used as well, however not in the co-writing format that the other tools have been used. This is also immediately a way to say that in the work you will constantly find ways to contextualise what is presented, almost like a digital foldout page. This is immediately another comment on the world of chatGPT where these contextualisations are not immediately present, yes now there are links, (sometimes), but these show where the rephrased context comes from. Instead here the context is not a justification of what is there, it just shows the environment from which it was chosen and observed. For an architectural gesture this feels more natural, and also fits within the advocacy of multiplicity projection instead of translation which forms a major thread in this thesis. For your information, throughout the text the colour RED and its friends all denote the text domain, and BLUE and its friends denote the image domain. Most importantly red quotes are quotes that were kept from suggestions based on content, magenta quotes from suggestions based on a generated text continuation (one that we never see itself - the reverse of GPT). Similarly BLUE are image based on content, CYAN are images based on prediction.</pre>

<li>&quot;If we now return to the apparently paradoxical proposition that first caught our attention, we see that the idea that architecture drew its principal ornaments from painting is neither rhetorical nor conjectural and that its significance is not limited to the field in which a treatise on painting might belong. If architecture (architecture, that is, not building) pertains to the order of the supplement, it is not (however much we might be tempted to agree with Schelling) as the metaphor of the art of building.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;Chapter 14, “Blotting Out Architecture?A Fable in Seven Parts,” translated by Julie Rose for publication inLog 1 (Fall 2003), was first given as the lecture “Effacer l’architecture” at the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal in May 2003. Introduction I keep thinking of myself as some sort of displaced philosopher. The issue of displacement is, in any sense, crucial to my work. According to Gilles Deleuze, philosophy has mostly to do with inventing concepts. In that sense, I am not a philosopher: I do not invent concepts, but I try to displace them.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;The revolution began with the destruction of the Bastille, that monument of (military) architecture and symbol of the ancien régime, whose end it marked at the same time that it heralded, as Jules Michelet would write, the triumph of “what is outside time, outside the future and outside the past, immutable Right. ” This takes us back to theEncyclopédie and the analogy Blondel’s text suggests between the rules obeyed by architecture and the principles of natural Right. Architecture or revolution—the modernist watchword, posed in the form of an alternative or a dilemma—was to translate as clearly as possible the ambiguity of the relations that the art of building, if not architecture itself, has never ceased to maintain with the prospect of a generalized catastrophe: either architecture looks to stave off such a catastrophe by rendering it useless, or it merely aspires to furnish humanity with the means to survive such a catastrophe without too much damage.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>

<li>&quot;What do all these facts and practices signify, not only for architecture as a concept but also for architecture as a phenomenon of culture, through the prisms of which we can see something of culture’s own architecture?On the concept of architecture, Jacques Derrida has opportunely reminded us that it is itself aconstructum, and whatever presents itself as an “architecture of architecture” has a history and is itself historical from one part to the next. This remains very much the case even if we accept that it is aconstructum that we inhabit, even as it inhabits us, and of a heritage that comprehends us even before we have made the effort to consider it. 9 One might object to the notion that every concept, beginning with the concept of culture, is more or less constructed—if the remark did not have the effect of obliterating the relationship (apparently a sensible but highly problematic one when you think of its history) that the concept of architecture clearly maintains to that of construction: a relationship of difference as much as of similarity.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;Schelling’s definition of architecture as the “metaphor of construction” does not necessarily imply that the proper meaning of architecture, let alone its truth, is to be found in construction; note that Gothic architecture and its linear model of a constructive system possess in their details none of the rigor of the working drawing. However, a whole aspect of architecture also derives from the category of themask—and indeed the exterior envelope of Dubuffet’sTower acts as a mask, one whose figures deny in dissimulation the constructive apparatus of modernity.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;But if, according to Friedrich Schelling’s famous metaphor, architecture is nothing but “frozen music” (eine erstarrte Musik), how are we to define music?As “defrosted architecture?” In the story of Amphion as told by Paul Valéry (who used it as an argument for a “melodrama,” set to music by Arthur Honegger), a temple is built through the agency of music. Having received the lyre from Apollo, the mortal Amphion gives birth both to music and architecture when he begins to play it. The stones move and assemble themselves into a temple.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>
