To block out an undesirable view, use a stained glass panel the size of the window; to focus attention on the view, select a rectangular or curved stained glass frame around clear glass.

The use of stained glass allows for a subtle filtering of light, which can be adjusted according to the desired intensity and color. This versatility makes the window a versatile tool for architects, who can combine it with other design elements to create a harmonious and functional interior space.", "suggest_context": "An ingenious device to siphon daylight deeply into a building, this glazed opening serves also to share illumination between rooms demanding acoustic separation, so as to spread light in a peaceful way, free of disrupting noise.
