The division of activities it once facilitated now takes on a more defined, compartmentalized form, reflecting the growing complexity of human society. In this gradual transformation, the wall's role shifts from enabler to boundary, marking the limits of private and public spaces.  The blank orthogonal depiction, once a reflection of the wall's simplicity, now serves as a testament to the increasing sophistication of architectural representation.  The structural container, once an afterthought, is elevated to a central concern, its curves and angles carefully considered to optimize functionality and aesthetics.", "suggest_context": "4.1.2 WALL How the lapse of time affects ownership and usage of the wall. Hanging loosely, perhaps flapping, the woven screen generates- and, crucially, symbolizes - the division and organization of activities within the primitive dwelling.
