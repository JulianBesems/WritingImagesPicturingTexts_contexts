    <div class="selected">Experience has shown during so many documented firefighter fatality incidents that Murphy’s Law, which simply states that anything that could go wrong…will go wrong, has happened repeatedly. Radio failure, burst hoselines, structural collapse, loss of accountability, and so many more problems have been known to occur when a firefighter was reported to be missing, lost, trapped, or when a victim called a Mayday. Using the earlier example of the firefighter trapped in the basement, if Plan A was to pull the victim up the stairs and it was found that the stairs were too weak to be used for the rescue, what is Plan B? Plan B can involve shoring the staircase from underneath, and a subsequent Plan C can involve using a ground ladder to bridge over the top of the stairs to distribute the weight.[Kolomay, Richard, and Robert Hoff *Firefighter Rescue And Survival*.

      <li>&quot;Going The depth of a stair tread from its leading edge to the vertical element between the treads (riser). Guardrail A rail to prevent a user falling down a well. Often a handrail does this, but in some stairs a separate higher guardrail is provided behind. Handrail The component gripped to aid ascent and descent. Imperial A staircase in an open hall commencing with a single straight flight to a wide landing where two branches either side return at 180°.&quot;[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*. Routledge, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Some people still protest that such a distinction should still be made – that the word ‘staircase’ should mean the enclosure and not the stair. However, this definition does not reflect either the OED or common usage. As the OED admits, the word staircase is now (and has been for some time) used to mean ‘a flight of stairs or sometimes a whole series of flights of stairs with their supporting framework, balusters etc. ’ This book will follow the OED definition and the general understanding, that a staircase means the whole, made up of stairs, balusters, handrails, etc.&quot;[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*. Routledge, 2014.]</li>

<li>&quot;Other dimensions apply to curved stairs 16 . Other factors relevant to stair safety include lighting, slip resistance, single steps (most codes prohibit flights of fewer than three steps), handrails, and inability to detect the edge of the tread due to lack of contrast. REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR EGRESS STAIRS The building regulations summarized below are from countries that are widely disbursed and culturally different, and should be representative of any range of methods used to treat egress.&quot;[Bukowski, Richard W. *Emergency Egress From Buildings*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;The so-called 7/11 stair geometry commonly required in US codes meets the relation 2R+G=635. Templer 15 summarizes a number of research studies of stair geometry and safety. Many such studies were conducted by observing people moving up or down stairs in buildings. Observations in subway or train stations at rush hours provided data for higher population densities.&quot;[Bukowski, Richard W. *Emergency Egress From Buildings*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Even for buildings less than 11 stories, occupants located closer to the stair may travel further in the stair than outside of it. Furthermore, because the stair shaft is required to be fire-rated and means of egress cannot have occupants move to a less safe location (NFPA 2009), the stair tends to be one of the last components in many complex egress systems.&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A. Milke (auth.) *Study of Movement Speeds Down Stairs*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;To transfer such a simple, historically  proven safety technique onto today&#x27;s  stairs, seems impossible. Modern man  has become a slave to precision work  and automation. Contemporary  understanding of stair construction  requires the stair to be as dimensionally  accurate as possible. Even the human step has become  regulated. The model for it probably  originates in the pace set by the infantry. &quot;[INPUT: stair.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;. Flight ± the section of a ramp or stair running between landings with a continuous slope or series of steps. .

<li>&quot;This book focuses on the movement of building occupants on a critical egress component – the stair. The objective is to document the findings of previous literature regarding movement speeds down stairs. This will be accomplished by examining the assumptions, methods, and results of previous studies. The movement on stairs is critical for determining the amount of time required to safely evacuate the building.&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A. Milke (auth.) *Study of Movement Speeds Down Stairs*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Stairs in Pathfinder Stairs are represented in Pathfinder through straight-run of steps. The model requires the input data about riser, tread and width (see Fig. 4. 21). In Pathfinder, the specified tread rise and run are the factors considered in the calculation, i. e. , the simulation is not dependent on the geometric slope of the stairs. Stairways denote areas where the maximum occupant speed is controlled by an alternate specific calculation.&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;34, para. 6, sent. 2 of the MBO specifies that stairs must be fitted with handrails on both sides and intermediate handrails where this is necessary for safety reasons. However, some federal state building regulations stipulate this for stairs in buildings with more than two dwellings reached via stairs. If stepless access (i. e. ramp or lift) to these dwellings is not possible, the use of the stairs by older occupants should be made safer and more comfortable by providing a handrail on both sides.&quot;[Heiss, Oliver *Barrier-Free Design*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Also, comments were made by respondents with disabilities regarding insufficient training and ability of their assigned ‘buddy’ to help them during the incident. Only 3 % of the occupants used elevators for evacuation and the rest of the population (including occupants with disabilities) used the exit stairs for evacuation. Evacuation trends on stairs Most occupants used the exit stairs to evacuate the building during this fire incident.&quot;[Kuligowski, Erica D., and Bryan L. Hoskins *Occupant Behavior in a High-rise Office Building Fire*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;4. 31 Histogram about the percentages of evacuees against the passage of time employing Pathfinder for all evacuation strategies metric, thus stair usage is distributed among the stairs. This is reflected in the fact that disproportional stair usages do not take place. The combined use of stairs and elevators (strategy 3) provides results approximately in the same range of Strategy 2 (see the green triangles in Fig.&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*.

<li>&quot;Spindle A term used to describe a turned baluster. Spiral A circular, helical or elliptical staircase. Other terms synonymous and in general usage include: vice; vis (French); winding; geometrical (when ‘cantilevered’); cockle. Staircase The whole ensemble including stair, balustrade and supporting newels, framework and any other integral structure. String The inclined side of a stair, usually composed of a board which supports the treads and risers.&quot;[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*.

<li>&quot;Floor areas and occupancy rates provide the traf®c ®gures for lifts and stairs. Building Regulations allow a minimum of two steps, a single step being considered dangerous. Sizes for the former can be taken from installers&#x27; catalogues whilst the latter has to be approved by the ®re brigade or licensing authority on means of escape in case of ®re. The key dimensions relate to the maximum number of steps within an unbroken ¯ight and the number and width of stairs needed for escape purposes.&quot;[Blanc, Sylvia, and Alan Blanc *Stairs, Second Edition*. Architectural Press, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;Open grid and chequer plate stairs are also used for industrial work. A higher standard of ®nish can be accommodated within metal trays or else laid on sheet steel formwork. The generic term is a `folded sheet stair&#x27; welded to plate or tubular strings. It is this type of industrialized steel stair that is widely adopted in commercial buildings, particularly with steel frame construction.&quot;[Blanc, Sylvia, and Alan Blanc *Stairs, Second Edition*.
