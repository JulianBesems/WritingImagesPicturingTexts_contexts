    <pre>In all of this the window serves as the prop for discovering new and unexpected relationships between the inside and outside. This window, like any other, relies on mechanisms of operation, instruments of opening and closure. Fundamentally, glass is hard, yet fragile and brittle. An ingenious device to siphon daylight deeply into a building, this glazed opening serves also to share illumination between rooms demanding acoustic separation, so as to spread light in a peaceful way, free of disrupting noise. Dramatic window accents can be beautiful, but if too much light enters a room, furnishings can take a beating.

<em>The frame, usually a humble companion to the glass, can also contribute to the visual drama. A well-crafted frame can elevate the window&#x27;s aesthetic, making it a work of art in its own right. This subtle interplay between glass and frame creates a harmonious balance, as if the two have been married for centuries.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;With a steel-beam frame filled in with thin panels of wood or metal or plastic, and panes of glass, there was almost no limit to how high an architect could go. Today buildings largely made of metal and glass are either very high status, like steel-framed and metal and glass-clad skyscrapers, or very low status, as with the beetlelike forms of the trailer park. Glass was once very expensive and therefore a sign of wealth. Before the nineteenth century most windows were made of many small panes of blown glass that had been cut open while hot and spun on a table so that they became flat and could be trimmed to fit into a small wooden or metal frame.&quot;[Lurie, Alison *The Language of Houses: How Buildings Speak to Us*.

<li>&quot;When appropriately framed, stained glass can add a beautiful appearance and works well with windows receiving a lot of light. Not only is a glass treatment pure joy from an artistic point of view, but it also presents additional possibilities for some people as well. Glass panels are perfect for behind garden tubs in the bathroom, or on patios for privacy. While previously used to primarily enhance windows and doors, contemporary home designers are using stained glass to enhance and create entire spaces in homes.&quot;[M.K., Makridakis, and Holland M. *How to Create Rooms of Radiance. Windows Treatments Made Simple*. 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Performance data are given in Appendix A1. 1, with typical total window U-values for different frame materials. The window frame must also be designed to provide adequate support for the weight of glass required. Although not strictly a daylighting matter, it can have an indirect influence on the provision of daylight because of the obstructing nature of framing sections. In non-domestic buildings there is an increasing use of structural glazing which does not employ frames. The glazing is usually arranged in an array of panes of toughened glass held together by specially designed corner plates bolted through the glass or by suitable adhesives.&quot;[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*.

<li>&quot;TO Is the emphasis now more on the glass than the frame? RVP Yes, no one likes heavy, thick frames. Steel ones can be very thin,  aluminum is in the middle, and PVC frames are mostly very thick; otherwise  they break. For bigger windows, they need to insert a steel tube inside the  plastic frame to make it strong enough. But then they found a system in which  the profile is made out of two parts held together with a very hard plastic,  which is strong enough.

<li>&quot;See page 21 for more information on skylight glazing . (Continued on page 20) STAINED GLASS A COLORFUL ALTERNATIVE Elegant, nostalgic, and colorfuL stained glass can turn a window into a work of art. With its combinations of hues and patterns and with the changing light of day, stained glass can liven up any room. Even after dark, you can turn on the room lights and enjoy the translucent tapestry of stained glass from your patio or garden. Depending on its design, a stained glass window can also provide privacy both at night and duringthe day.&quot;[*Windows &amp; skylights* Menlo Park, Calif: Lane Pub. Co, 1982.]</li>
<li>&quot;PAGE 39 WINDOW PAGE 40 WINDOW Glass Initially used primarily to let light in, glass -  traditionally  made out of silica (Si02) mixed with other chemical  compounds -  increasingly takes on additional roles  previously fulfilled by other materials. Continual improvements in the production of ever-larger panes means more  glass in windows, so much glass in fact that the window  itself starts to disappear. . . ca. 70 AD One of the earliest window panes,  3 mm thick, found near Herculaneum. WINDOW PAGE 41 &quot;[INPUT: window.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;To block out an undesirable view, use a stained glass panel the size of the window; to focus attention on the view, select a rectangular or curved stained glass frame around clear glass. Clear glass mixed at random with colored glass in a single panel gives a feeling of depth . A glass bird or foliage pattern complements house plants or enriches a garden view. If your window has many small panes, consider replacing only a pane or two for a colorful splash of light. For a room with a double-hung or horizontally sliding window, you can create an especially rich feeling by designing each sash with different colors.&quot;[*Windows &amp; skylights* Menlo Park, Calif: Lane Pub. Co, 1982.]</li>
<li>&quot;A sparkling effect is given them by dividing the upper portion into small squares of glass by sash bars. At Golderen, again, the round pane effect is gotten by means of “bull’s-eyes. ” The window frame, or casing, is frequently very similar to that of the American frame house, although with the uprights passing beyond the cross-pieces. The examples on pages 68 to 72 show a development in roof treatment and the effect of striking contrasts between cement and wood walls.

<li>&quot;Regardless of this qualiﬁcation, the question remains about the correspondence between facade representation and construction in the new frame buildings. Facade design was also affected by the technical possibility of achieving high-rise construction—a possibility brought about by the increased load-bearing strength of the new materials. High-rise construction and the widespread use of glass in the intervals of the frame led to an overall uniformity of the entire surface of the facade. This uniformity was apparent in both tall buildings and early skyscrapers, and in both types frame inﬁll became cladding, as is apparent in Louis Sullivan’s later works.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Toggle fixing shading or as part of a twin face wall 16. Glazing frame 11 Windows are fitted into stick glazing by applying an additional sub frame within the main framing against which the opening light is closed. The overall width of the window frame is usually of similar width to that of the main framing of mullions and transoms. Both outward or inward opening windows and doors are used, with some with their frames silicone bonded to the glass to reduce their visual impact externally, though the frames look similar from within the building.&quot;[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*. Ambra Verlag, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;See Modern Structures, p. 78. Exposed-frame curtain wall A type of glass curtain wall. Unlike the hidden-frame iteration, here the frame stands proud of the glass surface and may also include some additional trim. Although the frame is highlighted, its only structural function is to attach the glass panes to the supporting frame behind. See Walls and Surfaces, p. 99. F Fanlight A semicircular or elongated semicircular window sitting above a door but contained within the overall surround, with radiating glazing bars in the form of a fan or sunburst.&quot;[Hopkins, Owen *Reading Architecture  A Visual Lexicon*.

<li>&quot;Aside from ecclesiastical architecture, stained glass became a less common art form, and it was not until the Art Nouveau movement in the late nineteenth century (with Louis Comfort Tiffany in America, for example) and the early modern European artists such as Matisse, Chagall and Braque in the twentieth century that interest in this medium returned. Their work uses the power of glass to alter the quality of light, and this practice continues today with art glass sculptures intended to produce special effects (see Figure 36).&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Test the interior window frame in place and make sure no film edges stick out from behind the frame. Trim glazing material if needed, and then glue the frame in place over the film to create a finished interior look. Here are some other examples of windows that are made using the same basic principles in this tutorial. HOW TO MAKE A WINDOW WITH A FRAME WITHIN A LINER This kind of window can be made for either a curved or flat wall. I will demonstrate on a flat wall, but the same steps are done for installation in a curved wall, the main difference being that you’ll need to make sure that the tube/liner that the frame sits within is a little deeper so you’ll have enough depth to accommodate the curved wall.&quot;[Smith, Sally J. *Fairy Houses: How to Create Whimsical Homes for Fairy Folk*. Cool Springs Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;If the supporting structure is constructed to the correct height and fall, then the laminated glass sheets if used externally can be bonded directly to it rather than setting them into a steel sub-frame. Steel frames to support the glass use T-sections in order to provide a bearing for the glass at the top, but avoid a bottom flange to the supporting beam that would make the frame appear wider. Glass blocks with textured or ribbed surfaces are often used as they have good slip resistance. This type of construction has a high resistance to shock, and is capable of very high loadings.&quot;[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*. Ambra Verlag, 2013.]</li>

<li>&quot;Unless the frame is steel, which offers no resistance to heat transmission, it provides some level of reduction in thermal transmittance. The frame factor and its effect on the window&#x27;s U-value establish a basis for comparison when considering the energy savings of a change in window frame or sash material. A window&#x27;s location in a building affects its conductivity. In their 1974 study Windows: Performance, Design and Installation, authors Beckett and Godfrey categorized window exposure by localized environmental conditions. &#x27;&quot;[York, New *Repairing Old and Historic Windows: A Manual for Architects and Homeowners*. Washington, D.C: Preservation Press, National Trust for Historic Preservation, 1992.]</li>
<li>&quot;Instead of being fitted in a frame, the glass is fixed to a support, which in turn is attached to a structural element of the building, the tightness of the whole system being obtained by a silicone seal. The glass is fixed on its support by means of a silicone seal along the edges of the internal surface (fig. 5. 4). This technique can be used with almost all types of glass, including insulating glass units. The glazing is prepared in a factory by mounting a structural seal support frame onto the glass, complete with appropriate setting blocks, location blocks and distance pieces.&quot;[Garg, N.K. *Guidelines for Use of Glass in Buildings*. New Age Publications (Academic), 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Glass as Window The emergence of glass in window applications is attributed to the Roman imperial period. Window glass was first used in isolated applications, such as in the public baths to reduce air drafts. Early window glass was rather crude and unevenly translucent, as the techniques for producing transparent glass products were yet to be developed. Glass at this point was not about providing transparency or a view; it was most likely used for security and insulation from the exterior environment and for natural lighting.&quot;[Patterson, Mic *Structural Glass Facades and Enclosures : a Vocabulary of Transparency*. Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Laminated Glass Laminated glass consists of two or more pieces, or plies, of glass bonded together at the mating surfaces (Figure 2. 2). This is typically accomplished 25 26 Structural Glass Facades and Enclosures through the use of a sheet material, called an interlayer, that acts as the bonding agent. Laminated glass assemblies can utilize tinted-glass, highperformance coatings, silk-screened patterns, and pigmented interlayers, alone or in combination. Glass lamination is primarily intended to improve the structural properties of glass by compensating for its brittle behavior.&quot;[Patterson, Mic *Structural Glass Facades and Enclosures : a Vocabulary of Transparency*. Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011.]</li>

<li>&quot;Quick summary •• There are three parts to a window: frame, sash, and glazing (the glass). •• Windows can be swinging, sliding, stationary, or pivoting. •• There are multiple types of glass. Tempered glass and those with polycarbonate layers are the toughest to break. •• Impact-resistant glass is being used more frequently and presents forcible entry and egress challenges to firefighters. Fig. 9–11. A single door in the center of an apartment/motel building indicates a center hallway type building. • Multiple doors on the front of a dwelling occupancy indicate multiple or separate living areas.&quot;[Dodson, David W., and John Mittendorf *The Art of Reading Buildings*.

<li>&quot;Only fits across the top of a window frame. A focal point; usually mounted on the outside of a window frame. Curtain: A simple treatment, typically unlined, usually stationary or possibly hand drawn. Usually hung on a simple rod. Damask: A finer, thinner fabric than brocade, it mixes shiny and dull threads to create beautiful patterns of high luster. Can be crafted of silk, cotton, rayon or linen. Its patterns are usually reversible, an example being twocolor damask in which the colors reverse depending upon which side is shown.&quot;[Stoehr, Kathleen S., and Charles T.

<li>&quot;Only the basic frame stayed still, and this frame was meant to be almost invisible. A necessary prop—no more than that. As Esther McCoy wrote as a caption for an image of trees reflected on the glass walls of the Eames House, “After thirteen years of living in a house with exposed steel frame, Ray Eames said, ‘The structure long ago ceased to exist. I am not aware of it. ’ They lived in nature and its reflections—and reflections of reflections. ” 15IEE1 The house dissolved in a play of reflections, restless images that immediately caught the eye of the world.&quot;[Colomina, Beatriz *Domesticity at War*.
