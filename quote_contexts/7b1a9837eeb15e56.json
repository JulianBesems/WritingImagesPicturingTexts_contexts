In this sense, digital architectural encodings dealing with the non-geometrical cannot rely only on a structuralist idea of form as total code; they must also register the fluid, indexical and sometimes misaligned operations through which architecture participates in this digitally saturated field. The emphasis thus shifts from what is modelled to how we think with models: what kinds of games, stories, projections and mis-readings our digital instruments permit. In this sense, the digital architectural encodings dealing with the non-geometrical should be closer to Wittgensteins later understanding of language as an activity than to his early picture theory. As he puts it in the Philosophical Investigations: I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the activities into which it is woven, a language-game. The point is not that architecture becomes mere language, but that its digital models must accommodate the language-games that extend beyond form: the ways they stage, distort and extend architectural conversations across media, times and publics. In this thesis we will not attempt to encode all these non-geometrical dimensions directly into a single, comprehensive model. Instead, we treat them as a field of possibilities and domains against which any digital architectural instrument has to be positioned. Such an instrument must leave room for textual, temporal, atmospheric and scalar operations that cannot be collapsed into geometry or into a single logic of optimisation. If architecture is partly constituted by what it does across media, it must accept that some of its crucial operations live in probabilities, atmospheres, and misalignments. IGNORE - Invisible complexity Ryue Nishizawa and Rei Naitos Teshima Art Museum makes the point with almost no formal vocabulary at all. The museum is a single, droplet-shaped concrete shell, about 40 by 60 metres, poured as a 25 cm thick slab without any columns or visible beams. Two ovoid openings in the roof let air, sounds and light enter; rainwater and groundwater seep up through small holes in the floor and gather in slowly moving films and droplets. The shell is not a result of encapsulation but a careful negotiation between the earth and the sky; visitors freely walk around the 40 by 60 meter museum and connect with the present phenomena. Architecturally, almost nothing happens in geometric terms; structurally it is an engineering feat, but not one that displays its complexity. What matters is the choreography of time, weather, gravity and perception: a space where wind, insects, water and human bodies draw continuously changing patterns. Nishizawa enacts what Junya Ishigami describes as another scale of architecture, where architecture thus created will melt into the new environment now emerging and, simultaneously, give form to a new environment. That new environment  architecture. Here, the model of the building as a fixed object is entirely inadequate; the architecture is the environment it co-creates with non-human agents. - IGNORE"}
