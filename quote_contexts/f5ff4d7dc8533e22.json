The way light passes through or reflects off the wall can further emphasize this duality. In the case of the Kunstlinie Almere, SANAA's design takes advantage of this by incorporating large glass panels that allow natural light to illuminate the interior while also providing a visual connection to the outside.", "suggest_context": "He argued that structure is there within the wall, but the importance of the wall is the visible spatial enclosure. As thin as possible: fantasy of the two-dimensional wall, sketched in 3D by SANAA for the Kunstlinie Almere, Netherlands. The meaning of the wall is just as diverse as the uses of vertical surface can be, but there are at least two essential functions: providing structure and dividing space. Practically, however, the two modes of action are always in some sort united. The signicance of a walls threshold qualities notwithstanding, a wall is empirically also a screen, or cover; Openings must be made through these abutments for the areas to communicate with each other, and to diminish the surfaces in contact. From this perspective, structure is potentially an important architectural element  both as a source of light, where light passes through it or illuminates it, and also as controller of how and where light enters a space. When stone and masonry load-bearing wall construction dominated previous periods of architectural history, openings for light could be considered the absence of structure."}
