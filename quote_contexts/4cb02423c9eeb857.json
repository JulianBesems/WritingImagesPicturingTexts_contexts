Transduction, for Simondon, names the mediation by which potential becomes actual: \"Yet, in a perfect transducer, no energy is actualized; nor is any energy put in reserve: the transducer belongs neither to the domain of potential energy, nor to the domain of actual energy; it is truly the mediator between these two domains, but it is neither a domain of the accumulation of energy, nor a domain of actualization: it is a margin of indeterminacy between these two domains, that which brings potential energy to its actualization. It is during the course of this passage from potential to actual that information comes into play; information is the condition of actualization.\" Simondons relevance here is that he offers a way to speak about form-taking as an operation rather than the objectification of an idea. Bringing this back to architectural theory, Katie Lloyd Thomas makes clear that this is an existing pressure point already internal to architectural discourse, precisely because architecture is historically structured around a distinction between form and matter where the formal and conceptual is valued over the material. In representation, material becomes invisible or secondary, while form appears as what architecture properly addresses. Giving her own critique on the hylomorphic concept in architecture: Nevertheless architecture has hylomorphism at its base and sets up a discourse in which form must be realized in matter, with the material being seen as merely interchangeable  just one instance of matter rather than another. Against this condition, Lloyd Thomas insists on a more operative materialism, an attentiveness that brings materials into view as active participants in formation. Material is not an inert substrate awaiting the architects intention. Rather, materials are themselves active; it is a transaction, rather than a one-way operation, that occurs in the shaping of stuff. This processual view of material formation aligns with her broader argument that materials extend beyond matter through their interaction with tools, standards, and socio-cultural forces. When transposed to the digital, this suggests that digital material or data too must be understood as contingent, contextual, and modulated through interaction: not data-in-general, but data as prepared and specified, cleaned, tokenised, annotated, formatted, and made actionable through interfaces, metrics, and thresholds. If digital tools are understood as more than tools that impose structure onto data, but as instruments participating in a relational field of transformation, then computation aligns more with material practice than predicate logic. In this view, the digital becomes less a space of representation and more a space of emergence where modalities, like materials, operate through transduction, negotiation, and co-formation, instead of translation.\n\n*The notion of transduction, as Simondon proposes it, resonates with architectural theories that seek to decentre the designer's role and emphasize the agency of materials and tools in the design process. For instance, the concept of \" operative materialism\" as Lloyd Thomas describes it, where materials are not passive substrates but active participants in formation, echoes with the idea of \"construction as a process\" advocated by architects like Peter Eisenman and Zaha Hadid. Their design approaches focus on the material and spatial properties of the built environment, rather than merely imposing formal solutions onto the site. In this context, digital tools can be seen as instruments that facilitate and mediate the transformation of data into knowledge, rather than solely as tools for data representation.  The relational field of transformation, where modalities co-form through shared operation, is reminiscent of the concept of \"operational thinking\" developed by architect and theorist, Patrik Schumacher.
