These features are then aggregated and normalized across the corpus to create a set of statistical profiles that capture the distinctive styles and themes of each film. The profiles are then used to generate a set of query vectors that can be used to search the generic IMAGE and TEXT domains for corresponding visual and textual patterns. The search results are then filtered and ranked based on their similarity to the query vectors, and the top-ranked results are used to populate the image and text domains. Through this process, the films are effectively turned into a set of personalized search filters that can be used to navigate the vast expanse of the public domains. The resulting image and text domains are thus infused with the aesthetic and narrative sensibilities of the individual films, and can be used to explore the intersection of personal and public cultures.  This approach allows for a nuanced and context-specific understanding of the relationship between the individual and the public, and provides a new framework for thinking about the role of personal taste and preference in shaping our understanding of the world.", "suggest_context": "It is dominated by a philosophy of order, neighbourhood, and situs; at the same time as it dominates a technique of measurement, it gives rise to an analysis of position; at the same time as it is an evaluation of quantity, it provides the principal method for applying the finite to the infinite, or the infinite to the finite - whether we expand or sum; it is the infrastructure of calculation having measurement as a result and order as a condition; it finally allows us to talk about space, in differential geometry, but it constitutes it through tabulation - Michel Serres, Le Systme de Leibniz et Ses Modles Mathmatiques. Taking Serress point that series articulate order, neighbourhood, measurement, and position as a way of relating the finite to the infinite, the small, personal corpora below function as constructed series: finite, authored selections that measure qualitative features and fix a private position in proportion to the abundance of the public domains. As established in the first two chapters, the ambition is to establish projections between modalities and to demonstrate that such projections can be made specific, personal, and curated. The multi-modal datasets are therefore deliberately small in comparison to the PUBLIC domains and are intentionally partial. Their selection reflects a sensibility: not neutral sampling but situated, authored choices that enable a tuning between text and image distinct from, and in proportion to, the generic screens introduced above. 1. FILM The first corpus consists of films with subtitles. Films provide a naturally occurring multimodality: a continuous image stream articulated as frames and a co-present narrative channel articulated as subtitle text. We constrain the textual side to non-descriptive subtitle tracks to foreground dialogue rather than editorial commentary; sound-effects glosses and descriptive inserts are excluded. The two channels are retained as co-present but non-equivalent: timecodes allow adjacency without presuming that words describe images or vice versa. The working collection comprises 215 films. At times subsequent chapters operate on smaller, thematically cohesive subsets e.g., a single director or studio. The selection is intentionally personal; it reflects a preference for films I have watched and value, with a bias toward aesthetic and historical interest. The point is not canonization but tuning: this corpus sets the figurative and narrative register against which projections into the generic IMAGE and TEXT domains can be proportioned. Another viewers corpus would tune the instrument differently and thus produce a distinct proportionality. Operationally, films enter the instrument as: i dialogue text normalized subtitle lines with timestamps and ii time-indexed frames sampled sparsely to register scenographic change rather than to exhaust motion. Crucially, no attempt is made to collapse one channel into the other; adjacency is staged, not asserted as equivalence. Later chapters will mobilise this material to derive figurative concepts that orient image search and composition across the generic domains, while keeping the multi-modal gap intact."}
