Selected: By looking at objects through the levels of their abstractions, we realize the potency of information (in meaning and shapes, with which we can work), but at the same time we realize the sheer emptiness that is proper to abstraction, when we regard it on the symbolical level of indexes alone.

02. "*One of the challenges of encoding information into lists is to think of a delicate balance of its recorded materiality and symbolic capacities which don’t exclude but rather encapsulate each other.* [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=28&annotation=4I78AXQ3)"

05. "*The notions of encapsulation and encoding that were so central to a mathematical design process refer to essentially the same concept, but each attends to a distinct aspect of it.* [AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RFAYGAN3?page=19&annotation=4FHFFAIB)"

06. "*In this respect, content and expression could be seen as two different domains giving form to each other. The process of formalisation could be seen as a form of communication.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=184&annotation=26A4N5IC)"

10. "*space of representation, finding or constructing another level of representation of the same phenomena, where the question can be posed and answered once the coexistence between two levels is established. Speaking in terms of Hjelmslev, we can say that we are interested in finding a new content and expression-form for the same content purport. By applying the self-organizing model, I attempt to show that this is indeed possible.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=238&annotation=W29GEG7S)"
