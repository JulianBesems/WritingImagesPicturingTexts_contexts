<li>&quot;If detected, it is not uncommon for trains to be halted out of harm’s way until the threat has passed. Another very serious concern of all land-based surface transportation industries is flooding. Prediction of flooding at a specific location well in advance of its actual occurrence is very difficult due the inherent unpredictability of the weather conditions that lead to it. However, since most occurrences of flooding are preceded by heavy precipitation events that can be observed in great detail by weather radars, it is possible to predict (with a short lead time) which locations may suffer severe flooding conditions by applying detailed estimates of precipitation from weather radars in combination with hydrologic models capable of predicting the flow of this water after it reaches the Earth’s surface.&quot;[Encyclopedia of GIS, Shashi Shekhar, Hui Xiong, Xun Zhou (eds.), 2017]</li>
<li>&quot;How could it be risked, when modern architecture’s own relationship to catastrophe too often takes the form that Le Corbusier meant when, upon discovering New York, he wrote “a catastrophe, but a beautiful and worthy catastrophe”37—though now without an aesthetic effect to redeem the social or ecological mess?The form of tabula rasa, if not a hole, to which the place known as Ground Zero now corresponds in Lower Manhattan does not invalidate the thesis underlying the organization of articles devoted to architecture in theEncyclopédie.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>

<li>&quot;This evolution began with a fire that required a constant attention and human involvement; otherwise it would gradually die or burn the entire forest around us. Therefore, a fireplace represented a huge improvement, although it still required very frequent human attention to control the rate of burning and to reload. Also, heat was produced only when the wood was burning and because the fireplace had very little, if any, thermal inertia. Next, a ceramic room furnace emerged with its heavy ceramic bricks and tiles.&quot;[Inventive Engineering: Knowledge and Skills for Creative Engineers, Tomasz Arciszewski, 2015]</li>
<li>&quot;Thus, the GPS receiver on the ground is able to account for these factors in its calculations. So, for each value of the index i D 1; 2; 3; and 4, let ti denote the adjusted measurement by the GPS receiver of the time delay in the reception of the signal from satellite number i . If the receiver’s clock were synchronized with those of the satellites, then the distance to satellite i would be cti , where c is the speed of light. But, if the receiver’s clock were off by b seconds, then even a tiny value of b would result in huge errors in distance measurements.&quot;[Encyclopedia of GIS, Shashi Shekhar, Hui Xiong, Xun Zhou (eds.), 2017]</li>
<li>&quot;hurricane. Endangered airplanes can be given a warning and rerouted if need be. Another application is checking whether the airspace surrounding an airport ever gets too crowded by the arriving and departing airplanes. Applications Based on Continuously Changing Maps In many applications maps are not static but continuously changing. For example, the regions where drought occurs or where an epidemic occurs change with time within every country or state. Such changing maps are conveniently represented in spatial constraint databases similarly to the representation of the growing town area (Revesz and Wu 2006).&quot;[Encyclopedia of GIS, Shashi Shekhar, Hui Xiong, Xun Zhou (eds.), 2017]</li>
<li>&quot;The corner design also increases visibility for the traffic in this crossroad. With the added digital technology, this simple architecture is challenged. The digital elements could on the one hand be used as to increase the “message” behind the architecture of this particular building. Typically, though, these kinds of digital signage are placed rather random on many buildings in cities in which the content and intended use of the displays draws the attention away from the architecture of the building, challenge the architecture, or make the architecture blurrier.&quot;[Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies, Mikael Wiberg, 2010]</li>
<li>&quot;Currently, to provide routing and navigation solutions, an unreliable travel time database that consists of static weights as derived from road categories and speed limits is used for road networks.&quot;[Encyclopedia of GIS, Shashi Shekhar, Hui Xiong, Xun Zhou (eds.), 2017]</li>
<li>&quot;First, consider a trivial anonymous GPS trace containing only a single position (latitude, longitude, timestamp). This trace could pose a location privacy risk, if an adversary can infer the user’s identity. Identification is possible through • Restricted space correlation. A restricted space is a geographic area only accessible to one known person, such as a home or office. If samples originate from this location, the adversary can infer with high probability the user identity associated with this sample.&quot;[Encyclopedia of GIS, Shashi Shekhar, Hui Xiong, Xun Zhou (eds.), 2017]</li>
