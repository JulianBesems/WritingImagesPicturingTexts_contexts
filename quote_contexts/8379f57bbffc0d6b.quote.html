    <pre>4.1.1 FLOOR . . . staking the claim of civilization on the raw ground, encoding usage and assuming decoration, the floor then accrues complexity in its section while simplifying its surface details.

<em>...as the floor&#x27;s surface becomes a canvas for the stories of those who walk upon it, the once-barren ground now bears the weight of history, its every crease and crack a testament to the countless moments that have unfolded upon it.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;From Neolithic times onward, in  cultures all around the world, the threshing floor was a place of work but also a place of gathering,  dancing, ritual, and worship. It evolved into the square or plaza -  the meeting ground of the demos. A place of assembly and negotiation, it is then perhaps the first &quot;floor,&quot; as that word is used in  &quot;the floor of the parliament&quot; or &quot;the floor of the stock exchange. &quot;&quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Perhaps considered to be the dirty or untamed element continuous with landscape, the floor  has always been obsessively cleaned -  even scrubbed, polished and made to gleam. In th e PAGE 64 FLOOR 1843 &quot;I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber,  and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards  so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye-not even his-could  have detected any thing wrong. &quot; — Edgar Allen Poe, The Tell-Tale Heart  (illustrated by Daniel Horowitz, 2012) 1521 Vaulted floor, illustrated by Cesare Cesariano,  ready for the introduction of pipes. &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;But the Old English flor (1,000 AD), meaning floor, ground, pavement, and bottom (as in the bottom PAGE 8 FLOOR 2014 Featureless and soundless (except for sneakers, which squeak on it), an architecture office&#x27;s expansive  gray rubber floor, by manufacturers Nora, provides the most neutral possible platform for work. of a lake), could be both an Indoor and an outdoor condition. 3 The threshing floor -  an outdoor floor  technology predating the ancients -  was a bit of hardened or paved ground for stamping, thrashing  or grinding grain, often located on high ground to catch the wind.&quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The walls are a large “plane. ” The sofa is a large “plane. ” The floor coverings and floor are large planes. My apartment might be a fun example to analyze . . . Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor. The walls pull from the white in the floor—a quiet “plane” in contrast with the “pop” of the painted floors.&quot;[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy &amp; broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*.

<li>&quot;2. 1. Structure To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. In primitive buildings, the ground may be used as the floor.

<li>&quot;In English mediæval documents it is often Latinized into historia. In domestic and palatial architecture the storeys are thus enumerated, from the lowest upwards: basement or underground storey; ground-storey or ground-floor, at about the level of the ground; first-storey, usually the principal floor or storey. Then follow second, third, and so on, the upper being the garrets.&quot;[Parker, John Henry *A Concise Dictionary of Architectural Terms*. Dover Publications, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Exceptions to this would be rooms below ground level where damp could damage the timber, rooms which were likely to be wet due to their function, eg kitchens and sculleries, and some working class terraced housing built with clay block floors or stone flags. NB For more information on timber see Chapter 11- Timber-Frame Housing. The floor (often referred to as a raised timber floor or suspended floor) consists of a series of joists supported by the loadbearing walls and covered with floorboards.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;Inside it a chamber (8. 8 by 7m) is formed and a second storey once stood over it, the floor of which was supported by heavy timber beams laid transversely from north to south. The floor itself probably consisted of clayey earth laid over a bed of smaller transverse timbers and rushes. Access to the room beneath was only possible at second-storey level by means of a trap door and a ladder.&quot;[Fields, Nic, Donato Spedaliere, and Sarah Sulemsohn Spedaliere *Troy c. 1700-1250 BC*.

<li>&quot;At the waiting area, the wood floor pattern breaks the normal long-running board pattern with cross-stitched short boards slowing the visitor down. In the lounge area a brick floor with a simple running bond pattern define the informal dining area. At the kitchen visitors walk on an antiqued hexagonal brick floor. Even in the bathrooms, a carefully considered large stone floor pattern support a larger series of discrete experiences that work overall to quietly engage the visitor into quiet contemplation.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*.

<li>&quot;Later in this chapter, there are illustrations of refined rough floor plans employing different drawing methods. Regardless of the drawing method employed, this refinement process presents an opportunity to see the rough floor plan from a fresh vantage point, almost demanding a closer look at the plan details for the first time in the space planning process.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Look at the main entrance area, travel paths, major spaces, special spaces, and other elements. There is still plenty of time to adjust the plan to better satisfy spatial quality. In Illustration 6–9, the two digital perspective sketches demonstrate this type of preliminary spatial testing. (a) (b) Illus. 6–9 (a) Entry and reception desk; (b) interview stations Developing a Rough Floor Plan Sustainability Objectives The issues related to the importance of sustainability of the evolving floor plan early in its development were been raised in Chapter 5.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;Over the years, a few archaeologists have come to explore its crumbling stone buildings and pyramids. But almost no tourists visit. Some workers clear away trees and brush from the great pyramid. Others clean the floor of the temple. This floor greatly interests Ruz. All the other buildings in Palenque have stucco floors. The Temple of the Inscriptions has a flagstone floor.&quot;[Kops, Deborah *Palenque (Unearthing Ancient Worlds)*. 2008.]</li>
