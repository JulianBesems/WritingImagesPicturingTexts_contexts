      <li>&quot;This is the power of an open text, as Eco points out in The Role of the Reader: ‘An open text is a paramount instance of a syntactic-semantico-pragmatic device whose foreseen interpretation is a part of its generative process’ (Eco (1994a: 3)). Even in its creation the author anticipates and invites interaction. An open work summons collaboration between the reader and the text to create meanings.

<li>&quot;To this core of the documentation, a number of texts are often added, either in the form of a text collection or in the appendix to the grammar, which have the function of extended examples for how the system works in context. These texts are usually taken from the corpus of primary data on which the system description is based, but they do not actually provide access to these primary data because they are edited in various ways. Providing direct access to the complete corpus of primary data is typically not part of this format.&quot;[Himmelmann, Nikolaus P., Jost Gippert, and Ulrike Mosel *Essentials of Language Documentation (Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs Tilsm)*. Mouton de Gruyter, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The paperbased text is a static document, and it is permanent, depending on the material durability of its text bearer. Although the digital text may be rendered in print on a sheet of paper, the materiality of the digital text allows for changes in a way that differs fundamentally from those that apply to the printed text. Its material stability only lasts as long as no changes are made to the computer file in which it is stored, and, in addition, the text may look different each time it is displayed or printed, or across different platforms, while still retaining its former character-bycharacter identity.&quot;[Duncker, Dorthe *The Reflexivity of Language and Linguistic Inquiry : Integrational Linguistics in Practice*. New York ; Routledge, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is amazing how rapidly one forgets what abbreviated notes made while recording and interviewing mean. 1 Digital text has a number of advantages: it is compact, stable, easy to store, access, and index, and can express hypertextual relationships (links). There are a large number of tools available to process text data (text editors, word processors, databases, browsers, etc), and well established literacy traditions and knowledge of written text in many communities. However, it is less rich than audio and video as there is always loss of information when ‘reducing language to writing’.&quot;[Himmelmann, Nikolaus P., Jost Gippert, and Ulrike Mosel *Essentials of Language Documentation (Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs Tilsm)*. Mouton de Gruyter, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Such a type is called a balanced paragraph. Hence we can state that graphical means add to the work’s visual expressiveness and sounding alike, thus facilitating the process of text interpretation. We should also add that unusual punctuation and graphics are most widely used in poetry, where the outer form often functions as a special code presenting and recording the aesthetic fj§| information. Poems, as is known, work at more than one level of interpretation. The graphical form of contemporary poetry has becomc most intricate as if visually reflecting the ever-growing complexity of modem reality, transformations occurring in men’s both physical and spiritual worlds.&quot;[Кароліна., Лотоцька *Стилістика англійської мови*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;In understanding prospection and encapsulation it is not necessary to postulate that some segment of a text is in a conceptually superior position to its surroundings. Spoken text as a physical event is momentary, and so only its meaning-trace is available for reference. The meaning-trace remains relevant for a short time, but its relevance decays unless it is encapsulated. Written text is physically longer-lasting, and the conventions of writing stress that care is taken to make the cohesive references clear and precise; however, it seems that readers do not normally take advantage of the option, always open, to return to an earlier place in the writing to check an encapsulation; they prefer to rely on the immediate text to give them enough to continue looking ahead rather than behind.&quot;[Gerbig, Andrea, and Oliver Mason *Language, People, Numbers: Corpus Linguistics and Society (Language and Computers : Studies in Practical Linguistics)*. Rodopi, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;(12) If we start from the supposed empirical data, these very data will impose the opposite procedure. If the linguistic investigator is given anything . . . it is the as yet unanalyzed text in its undivided and absolute integrity. Our only possible procedure, if we wish to order a system to the process of that text, will be an analysis, in which the text is regarded as a class analyzed into components, then these components as classes analyzed into components, and so on until the analysis is exhausted.&quot;[Lamb, Sydney, and Jonathan J. Webster *Language and Reality: Selected Writings of Sydney Lamb*. Continuum, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;They are not fixed in length and, given the limitations of the current incarnation of the Digital Replay System, are difficult to code as events occurring over time and not at particular moments in time. There is, then, a need to develop ways in which their occurrence across utterances can be time stamped and marked out. One way Linking the Verbal and Visual: New directions for corpus linguistics 285 in which this might be achieved is to represent the utterances and gestural patterns made by parties to a conversation in individual transcripts, so to develop a &#x27;textured text&#x27; consisting of separate layers.&quot;[Gerbig, Andrea, and Oliver Mason *Language, People, Numbers: Corpus Linguistics and Society (Language and Computers : Studies in Practical Linguistics)*. Rodopi, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Furthermore, coding schemes need to be developed in such a way that that they can be shared across different research communities with different community cultures and different representational and analytical needs. In such circumstances, as analytical categories are re-classified in the light of new audio-visual evidence and as new insights from different research communities emerge, coding schemes need to be maintained as dynamically as possible. 3. 4 Representation The final concern of the corpus development is related to the way in which the multiple streams of coded data are physically re-presented.&quot;[Gerbig, Andrea, and Oliver Mason *Language, People, Numbers: Corpus Linguistics and Society (Language and Computers : Studies in Practical Linguistics)*. Rodopi, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;(1 5f) For linguistic theory, H. goes on, the objects of interest are texts, so the aim of linguistic theory is &quot;to provide a procedural method by means of which a given text can be comprehended through a selfconsistent and exhaustive description. But linguistic theory must also indicate how any other text of the same premised nature can be understood in the same way. &quot;( 1 6) . That is, the theory must provide a procedural method for describing any text - not just previously occurring texts but &quot;any conceivable or theoretically possible texts&quot; ( 1 7) - in a given language; and more than that: But linguistic theory must be of use for describing and predicting not only any possible text composed in a certain language, but, on the basis of the information that it gives about language in general, any possible text composed in any language whatsoever.&quot;[Lamb, Sydney, and Jonathan J. Webster *Language and Reality: Selected Writings of Sydney Lamb*. Continuum, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;In written texts the assumption is that the information focus is unmarked, unless the use of italics, capitals or special punctuation suggests otherwise. 182 LINGUISTICS FOR LANGUAGE LEARNERS 10. 4 Generic structures Cohesion, with its multiple layers of structure, allows us to characterise text and describe how text can cohere. Cohesion dm form a basis for contrastive analyses of written language and, considered together with information focus, of spoken language.&quot;[(auth.), Anthony F. Hartley *Linguistics for Language Learners*. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 1982.]</li>
<li>&quot;As such, this means that the data is not directly accessible, and the format is subject to change (so that attempting to open a file stored in one version of the software with a later version may not always work – see Chapter 14 for examples). As a result, proprietary formats are not ideal for long-term storage (i. e. the encoding is not portable and reusable). Non-proprietary formats, e. g. Unicode plain text, or wav audio, are open and transferrable between hardware and software. When processing the data it can be useful to distinguish three kinds of contexts each requiring different data formats (see also Johnson 2004): 1. working context – the way the data is stored for on-going research work of annotation and analysis; 2. archiving context – how the materials are to be stored for long-term preservation (see below); 3. presentation context – the form of the data for distribution and publication.&quot;[Himmelmann, Nikolaus P., Jost Gippert, and Ulrike Mosel *Essentials of Language Documentation (Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs Tilsm)*. Mouton de Gruyter, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;One important contrast between these two processes is that every time the former occurs, the creative one, it changes the generative power of the system, the set ofpossible texts that can be produced. Here we are talking about something quite different from the so-called &quot;creativity&quot; which some analytical linguists have talked about in recent decades, enchanted by our ability to form new combinations of words using existing syntactic structures - actually a rather prosaic ability in comparison, comparable to going through a cafeteria line and selecting a new meal that one has never eaten before.&quot;[Lamb, Sydney, and Jonathan J. Webster *Language and Reality: Selected Writings of Sydney Lamb*. Continuum, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;Inevitably this involved considerations of meaning, as well as the development by him of the formal concept of transformation. In the socially focused approaches text (whether spoken or written) is the material site where socially produced meaning emerges. Text is the means of realizing nonmaterial social meanings, in language or in other representational modes.&quot;[*Companion To Semiotics and Linguistics* Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The relevant difference between edition and (original) authorship is that the editor is a kind of (minimally interfering) co-author, but that the base text exists prior to the editing, and in this sense editing can be compared to the reporting that goes into reported speech. The editor attempts to present a “verbatim repetition” of the base text, but also reflexively takes into account the communicational situation in which the edition (i. e.&quot;[Duncker, Dorthe *The Reflexivity of Language and Linguistic Inquiry : Integrational Linguistics in Practice*.
