Although we will be critical to some current phenomena, this is not necessarily to say that they are wrong, or inherently problematic, the critique is more a positioning in terms of what might be added, and where the gaps are in the current way of architectural thinking within the digital.

By examining the current state of architectural information in the digital realm, we will identify areas where computer-aided design and analysis can complement traditional architectural methods. Furthermore, the thesis will investigate how architects can critically engage with the digital tools and technologies that are increasingly influencing their profession.", "suggest_context": "1 INTRODUCTION In the introduction we will first discuss where exactly this thesis, that explicitly doesn't interact with architectural information per-se, situates itself within the architectural, and how it hopes to be relevant to the broader discipline of architecture.
