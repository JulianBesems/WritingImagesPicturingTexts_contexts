    <pre>The dominant computational model in architecture is currently that of the 3D CAD model, and in many practices especially that of the integrated BIM model. In turn these models mediate the other modes of architectural communication. They directly propagate plans, sections, renders and diagrams from which the idea of the architectural design is understood. In this form the 3D model can be seen as a universal model that connects all representations. This connection is defined by means of the Cartesian coordinate system through linear projection, dictated by the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Euclidean geometry as defined in Euclid’s work Elements is presented as an abstraction of physical space, and as such was initially bound to 3 dimensions, as is currently the case in its use in the 3D model . Later this definition was broadened to include n-dimensions. The Cartesian coordinate system serves as an encoding of this space by being able to refer to specific points in space by means of a set of orthogonal coordinates, an alternative is for instance polar coordinates. The linear connection from 3D model to a plan, section or even render is calculated based on these orthogonal coordinates by projecting them onto a single plane. By connecting all models of communication, it could be argued that through the 3D model the architectural object has been internalised into the Cartesian system in its entirety. Singular, and with no abstraction, the architecture is internalised within computation. Further development in this direction is that of the digital twin, where the digital seeks to be identical to the physical manifestation of the architecture.</pre>

      <li>&quot;The following part of the chapter is devoted to positioning the paradigm of reflectivity in design with regard to the paradigm of interactivity. Both semantic fields presuppose a feedback loop between user and system, but I will argue that introducing the concept of reflective technologies helps us think about design as a critical activity that expands the design space.&quot;[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]</li>
<li>&quot;The Second Chapter offers to switch from the interactive to the reflective design paradigm. The book posits that interactive design as a paradigm of design relies on a model that focuses on activities and does not question the values, the aesthetics of the artifact and therefore restricts the expansion into new norms, or new aesthetics. On the contrary, reflective design is about methods that generate new questions about functionalities, but also personal emotions, social rituals, formats, and knowledge.&quot;[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]</li>

<li>&quot;The fifth line gives a succinct viewpoint of the disciplines that are primarily concerned. Though a simplification of what different Fig. 2. 4 Overview interactive/reflective paradigms 40 Rheingold (2000). 42 2 From Interactive Design to Reflective Design disciplines bring into analysis and design, the framework highlights methodologies and concepts that are involved (Fig. 2. 4). 2. 5  esigning for Reflection: Two Use Cases in Distributed D Networks While the first three examples described completed artifacts and their critical standpoints, the following two examples focus on the design process and show how the plane of representation was crucial.&quot;[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]</li>

<li>&quot;The room stands for physical interaction space. Data-furniture is both physical objects networked with computer systems and digital artifacts linked to the physical environment. The notion of data-furniture connects experience of mnemotechnics and cognitive science for the interface. It is a spatially organized information architecture, in which data are revealed through users’ movement and action in the combined real-virtual space and interaction with other users. Data-furniture depicts digital information as visible, audible, tangible, and touchless interface objects integrated in architectural space.&quot;[Aesthetic Computing, Paul A. Fishwick, 2006]</li>
<li>&quot;The epistemological cut between “being in the world” and “representing the world” is crucial to the understanding of what these technologies mean for human beings but also for designers. As design tools, they open a design space which is the foundation of our reflection. Reflective technologies therefore not only are based on a model of teleological action and of psychological and cultural aesthetic experience, they also open a space of representation. Using the reflective metaphor not only helps interaction designers consider information technology as new media, a specific milieu for reflection, it also helps them consider more broadly what is needed in the design process: a place, or means, to distance themselves, or even extract themselves from the obviousness of everyday use. 2. 4. 4  eflective Technologies as a Metaphor for the Design R Process To elaborate from the interactive metaphor to get to the reflective metaphor means that we change the agenda from engineering to political.&quot;[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]</li>
<li>&quot;There is, therefore, a double need to understand the properties of these reflective artifacts: first to understand these technologies to better design them, second to understand how they offer a design space with tools and metaphors to think about design and conception properly. More generally speaking, media offer an autonomous and reflexive material that help designers invent new aesthetics. In the Third Chapter, I contrast the sociology of use and the engineering research perspectives on the “user”.&quot;[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]</li>
<li>&quot;We must emphasize that transparency is not a bad aesthetic or design strategy. Problems arise only when transparency is regarded as the exclusive goal of interface design, because in such cases the design may ignore the need for the user to be critically aware of the interface itself. Digital art promotes such critical awareness, as do a range of new design strategies in MR. We conclude by returning to the two approaches to aesthetic computing: what we called the code view and the interface view.&quot;[Aesthetic Computing, Paul A. Fishwick, 2006]</li>
<li>&quot;The challenge for design is how to deal with these impressions, and materialize them into design proposals. While impressions and potentiality are fundamental to the design sensibility, “Secondness” defined by Peirce, that is the actual elements of a situation including humans and non-humans, is what designers have to work with. The composition of the new artifact is one of the stages where design ingredients are tested up against each other. To design and to observe design is to use methods that capture these dynamic tensions and consider the agency of the elements of conception.&quot;[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]</li>
