    <pre>. . the floor. Thats right. The floor. Its typically the largest horizontal surface in the room and undeniably the most used. To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. The walls are a large plane.  The sofa is a large plane.  The floor coverings and floor are large planes. ALL you need is a plane and a nice clear piece of wood. For example, a marble runner within a wooden floor could form a pathway through a hall and into a living space, perhaps continuing to the fireplace or window;

<em>the fireplace or window, providing a natural visual focus for the room. The plane of the floor then becomes a unifying element, tying together the various planes of the walls, ceiling, and furniture. By incorporating plane elements in a harmonious manner, the overall aesthetic of the space can be greatly enhanced.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;The walls are a large “plane. ” The sofa is a large “plane. ” The floor coverings and floor are large planes. My apartment might be a fun example to analyze . . . Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor. The walls pull from the white in the floor—a quiet “plane” in contrast with the “pop” of the painted floors.&quot;[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy &amp; broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*. Skyhorse Publishing, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;The table and charts are usually computed by the zonal cavity method. In this method, a room is divided into three horizontal zones, called floor, ceiling and room cavities. 454 Building Engineering and Systems Design The effective reflectance of each cavity is then detennined from the reflectances of the floor and ceiling and from a factor called cavity ratio.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;A folded white surface defines the space within the darker brick and concrete volume. This folded plane becomes reception desk, perimeter wall, colour bar, work station, retail and graphic display, storage and seating. Transparency and connection between spaces was important to the client. Glass walls and operable panels slide open to create larger rooms for events and shows.&quot;[Chang, Catherine *Beauty Salons*. Liaoning Science &amp; Technology Publishing House, Profession Design Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Outside becomes in, inside becomes out. Lighting armatures and lighting levels were very important because of the function of the space, and soft lighting combines with natural materials to create a warm, welcoming feel. 在室内的表面设计中，马赛克、天然石材、木材、玻璃和镜 子等材料相互作用，打造出了一曲和谐的乐章。设计师精心 挑选了一些图案、海报和标语贴在墙面上，为空间增添了浪 漫的感觉。 2 1.

<li>&quot;This ratio depends on the size and shape of the room, the mounting height of the luminaires above the floor and the height of the work plane above the floor. For a specific room cavity ratio and luminaire, U can be obtained from a table, with the previously detennined effective reflectances. Suppose, for example, that 100 ft-c are to be provided on desks in a 1,000-sq ft office.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;Assessing the levels of natural light in an interior is the first step to designing your lighting. The different views shown here (above and below) of the fabulous, dark lacquer, pivoting-panel doors in my home illustrate how much impact the choice of materials has on light. I designed these innovative floor-to-ceiling doors to divide my television room from my open-plan dining space, and whatever angle they are moved to, their shiny surfaces bounce light around and reflect ever-changing views of the room.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Avoiding visual rivalry, in turn, brings the illusion of height to a low-ceilinged room. Some argue, knowingly, that adding one-third to one-half wall color to white perceptibly elevates a ceiling to greater heights. Conversely, a ceiling painted the same color as the walls seemingly lowers the ceiling. So, too, does painting it darker than the walls. In spaces with sufficient light, a shade of white works well as a frame for contrasting walls.&quot;[Phillips, Betty Lou, and Don Piassick *The French room*. Layton, UT, United States., France: Gibbs-Smith, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;• Have spaces been made visually varied and interesting by using changing ceiling heights and soffit areas as well as nonrectangular spaces?• When appropriate, are rhythmic or sequential spatial experiences provided?• Are the proportions of walls and spaces esthetically pleasing?| 101 102 | Developing a Rough Floor Plan With the rough floor plan nearing completion, now is the time to test and evaluate its three-dimensional potential.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Lighting can also be employed to mark out zones within the framework of the grid. A line of floor washers running along the base of a wall; a grid of recessed downlights in the ceiling; LED strips concealed along the top of cabinetry or the underside of shelves; a row of pendant lights suspended over a kitchen worktop or dining table; or the strict, balanced placement of floor or table lamps to create symmetry all provide a combination of ambient, task and decorative or statement lighting.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Whenever a floor plan arrangement emerges in any stage of the planning process, some form of three-dimensional sketch, no matter how rough or tentative, can be useful. It is not necessary to debate here whether a solidly functional floor plan is more important than a visually satisfying space; both are crucial to well-designed and sustainable interiors.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;For examples, a single space could be bedroom, study room and parlour at the same time. The charm of the &quot;mix and match&quot; of functions lies in the relaxing atmosphere created in such a multi-functional space. Meanwhile, to some extent, such an unconventional space layout would likely free us from certain constraints. The space with a European style shown above is mainly used as a study room.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*. Design Media Publishing Ltd, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Garrets are not places to experiment with bold, eye-popping colors, even when bathed in light. The same serene shade on walls and ceiling masks odd contours, increases the feeling of space, and leaves a room feeling tranquil, which is indeed the goal. Enveloping walls and sloping ceilings in a small-scale-patterned paper—one that matches the mood of the times—also creates an air of spaciousness.&quot;[Phillips, Betty Lou, and Don Piassick *The French room*. Layton, UT, United States., France: Gibbs-Smith, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Dividing up the area of the facade The facade to a storey can be divided into three principal areas (fig. A 2. 2. 2): • high-level windows • eye-level windows • low-level windows At the top and bottom (junctions) we also have the following additional terms, which originate from perforated (fenestrated) facades: • lintel area: the area between window/door and underside of floor above 39 Edges, openings a a a b b b d c e c c A 2. 2. 2 • threshold area: the area between (glazed) door and top side of floor below Visual relationships The desire for a supply of fresh air is often coupled with the need to stand directly adjacent to the opening (at an open window).&quot;[Herzog, Thomas *Facade Construction Manual*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;Then, there’s a simple neutral sisal rug on the floor, which adds texture, ties into the color of the beige floor squares, and adds a little calm to the room. Sofa: quiet. Also beigey. Pillows: mixture of quiet and “wow,” drawing from the other patterns, colors, and materials in the room to inform a balance of “wow” on an otherwise neutral piece. This might sound a little milquetoast at first glance, but then POP!&quot;[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy &amp; broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*. Skyhorse Publishing, 2016.]</li>

<li>&quot;Built-ins generally stretch from wall-towall, and often floor-to-ceiling, to make use of every inch. Built-ins are not only integral to a house in terms of function and structure, but in visual terms as well. Freestanding armoires, chests, and bookcases will fill up a small room quickly and tend to make any space feel more crowded. A wall of built-in cabinets can contain more possessions than all of these combined and comes off as far less visually intrusive.&quot;[Shafer, Jay *The Small House Book*.
