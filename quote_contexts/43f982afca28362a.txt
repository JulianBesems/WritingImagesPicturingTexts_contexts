Selected: We were suddenly buried in a slew of new questions that had us trying different ways to get the upstairs door to slam, such as opening and closing the exterior door with the attic door open and then closed. Though our efforts to replicate the door slamming event did in fact get the upstairs door to move, nothing produced a result that came close to the door-closing we caught on video.[Cole, Jeff Scott *Ghostly Encounters: Confessions of a Paranormal Investigator*.

--- Context List ---
01. "Hermann entered the bedroom…. Hermann went behind the screen. There he found a small iron bedstead. To the right was the door to the study; to the left– the other door, into the passage. Hermann opened this door and saw the narrow spiral staircase that led to the bedroom of the poor young ward. Hut he turned back and entered the dark study. ’ In this passage Pushkin uses various dramatic effects of lighting and the presence of a sleeping servant to ratchet up the tension, but the strongest impression is of the sense of uncertainty and trepidation that Hermann, his heart beating faster than normal, would have felt each time he quietly opened door after door."[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]

02. "Here, we get an enticing glimpse of it from a room painted in the altogether calmer ‘Teresa’s Green’. The spaces are united by the ‘Pointing’ woodwork. BELOW RIGHT The ‘Stone Blue’ door is an enticing invitation to return to the adjacent hall. But when entering the room, painted in ‘Buff’ (A), you pass this shot of colour immediately and are less aware of it once in the room."[Studholme, Joa, and Charlotte Cosby *Farrow & Ball How to Decorate: Transform Your Home with Paint & Paper*. Mitchell Beazley, 2016.]

03. "Significantly in Chatwin’s description, the girl enters and exits through ‘a door’, the image of which provokes a dramatic contrast with that of a way of life roaming wide and free across land without compartments. Without being overly emphasized in Chatwin’s passage, this door and the room to which it gives closure compounds the air of cultural displacement surrounding the girl."[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]

04. "SCENE 56 INT. 18 RUE PHILIPPE LORAND, LANDING OUTSIDE MAID’S ROOM—DAY CREDENCE and NAGINI reach the landing. A door stands ajar. A shadow cast by lamplight: what seems to be a woman, sewing. The shadow pauses in its work. NAGINI is edgy, nervous, looking around. IRMA (O. S. )Qui est là?CREDENCE can neither move nor speak. NAGINI realizes this. NAGINI C’est votre fils, madame."[[Rowling, J. K. Rowling, and J. K.] *Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - the Original Screenplay*. Pottermore Publishing, 2018.]

06. "Following the way, started with the entry from the superior bunker, developed in the coming down "C" staircase and crossing the anteroom and the room of conferences, one entered, through the usual door to watertight seal, a small antechamber turned to guard-room. From this room, with four ramps of staircases, each of eleven steps, one reached the emergency exit, in the gardens of the Chancelleries (Figure 23)."[Guido, Dr. Pietro *Führer bunker - Discovered its mysteries*.

09. "Many open-hall houses have three doorways leading from the hall to buttery, pantry and stair, and even if subsequently rebuilt the stair was clearly a straight flight against the wall. Downholland Hall near Ormskirk, Lancashire (Figure 2. 12, Chapter 2) has a straight wooden stair with a heavy plank string pierced with tracery, which is clearly Medieval, but such survivals are extremely rare. 1 Stokesay Castle, Shropshire, has an external stone stair to the parlour block and a remarkably long straight stair in the great hall (Figure 2. 9), with solid wooden treads, triangular in section, nailed to sloping bearers, and a grip handrail."[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*. Routledge, 2014.]

10. "A flight of stairs leads from this room to the ice cellar beneath, and another over them to the shed chamber; and a door opens upon the piazza or recess near the wood-shed, (this recess in front of these kitchens will be found by the farmer's wife a convenient place for drying dairy utensils, &c. ) Connected with this room are a cheese room and a milk room, with windows to the north, the sash of which should be hung so as to swing either out or in, and its place in warm weather to be supplied with a wire gauze; and the doors should have shutters of the same material, to exclude insects, and at the same time admit the air freely."[Visser, Thomas Durant *Field guide to New England barns and farm buildings*. UPNE, 1997.]

13. "On the contrary, I found myself in front of a decorous residence of the Berliner outskirts, with a closed front door and the residents' names put on an old interphone. Schreier was waiting for me on the door step at the first floor: a tender greeting, then he introduced me in the working room. It was a great room almost totally occupied by a large table, full of drawings and photos."[Guido, Dr. Pietro *Führer bunker - Discovered its mysteries*. Editions ISEM Milan, 2006.]

14. "Some people still protest that such a distinction should still be made – that the word ‘staircase’ should mean the enclosure and not the stair. However, this definition does not reflect either the OED or common usage. As the OED admits, the word staircase is now (and has been for some time) used to mean ‘a flight of stairs or sometimes a whole series of flights of stairs with their supporting framework, balusters etc. ’ This book will follow the OED definition and the general understanding, that a staircase means the whole, made up of stairs, balusters, handrails, etc."[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*. Routledge, 2014.]

15. "That part in front of hall door is 12x13 feet. The hall is nice and contains a neat stairway, the landing of which is large and can be used as a receptacle for plants or other hall ornaments.

The kitchen is cut off from main house and contains back and cellar stairs and opens into dining room through a serving room or pantry."[Barber, George F., and Michael A. Tomlan *Victorian Cottage Architecture: An American Catalog of Designs, 1891*. Dover Publications, 2012.]

16. "Palladlan stairs are  always enclosed by  walls; visual cross-  connections are unthinkable. A spatial construct  created by stairs, the  creation of a stairwell,  was only achieved In  stairs winding around  large openings, stair  'eyes'. Palladio used Roman  stairs for his winding ^  stair, such as Bramantes  creation In the Vatican (1507-1514) and possibly also Raffael s  design for the Villa  Madama. " "[INPUT: stair.pdf]

19. "The parlor and dining room are connected by sliding doors. The bed room has been made narrow in order to get a good closet and a large bath room. A good change, however, would be to make this room into a dining room and the dining room into a sitting room, omitting the closet in the bed room and shortening the bath room into a serving room and connecting with the kitchen."[Barber, George F., and Michael A.

23. "The elevated moving stairs and exciting lifts create a new art form (Figures 3. 18a and 3. 18b). The success rests upon the innate curiosity of people to ascend and move to brighter elements in the interior.
