    <pre>Fascinatingly, in the built environment, I wouldn&#x27;t say we should expect or if you&#x27;d ask me hope for a return of obvious decorative ornament per-se. But there is something where the technology becomes ornament, in the sense that it conveys grandure, or hosts spectacle. First through structure becoming decorative with Rogers and Piano, Gehry, and so on, but now I think we&#x27;re past that as well. Instead the absence of structure is the decorative more, see the large span of Ishigami&#x27;s table, or Nishizawa&#x27;s Naoshima museum, which very silently is the largest shell structure: decoration through absence. The purity of the surface without anything else. So here the surface has internalised the ornamentation beyond the visibly identifiable, but in it&#x27;s own content.

<em>This tension between the absence of structure and the presence of surface has led to a new generation of architects who are rethinking the role of ornament in their designs. They are no longer concerned with adding decorative elements to the exterior of a building, but rather with creating a sense of ornament through the manipulation of light, color, and texture. For example, the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma has used natural materials such as wood and stone to create structures that are both functional and beautiful, with the beauty being derived from the materiality of the surface rather than any external embellishments. Similarly, the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava has used flowing lines and curves to create a sense of movement and dynamism, with the surface of the building becoming a dynamic and expressive entity that is greater than the sum of its parts.</em></pre>

    <div class="selected">Some films can capture a shift in architectural mood even before architects are aware of it. Bladerunner really did detonate an interest in dystopia, and an exploration of the city of the future as messy and dark with machines dripping steam, and backstreet DNA analysts. It became the subject of seminars and conferences at architecture schools around the world. Others, such as Antony Minghella’s Breaking and Entering, manage to convey something of the essential nature of city life, in the way that a city is multilayered, an environment in which very different groups of people exist side by side in the same space but hardly acknowledge each other’s existence.[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*.

      <li>&quot;It is a change that has forced designers to explore other approaches to design, to look at the ways that design can be used to communicate the purpose and the meaning of an object, rather than to treat design primarily as a question of solving mechanical and technical problems. There is, however, one area of design where the idea of objective analysis on the functional model has maintained its grip. To ask about how an object can be made and used in ways that will minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions has allowed a new generation to rediscover the moral certainty of functionalism.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*. Rizzoli Ex Libris, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Fourth, it facilitates timber architecture greatly that wood can be cut into  thin planks and laths of any dimension, which in themselves are a kind of  natural textile material and accordingly are used for dressing timber construction. This type of dressing, applied generally and in a principled manner, leads to a new style of timber architecture —one that contrasts with  plank construction — by preparing the way for monumental architecture (see  p. 371 and farther below). A middle way between solid columns and beams and the boards used for  dressing consists of posts and planks that, when applied as the dominant element, likewise define a special style (see Norman timber architecture below). &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;This important fact, often pointed out in my earlier chapters, settles once  and for all the vain quarrel about the Vitruvian wooden hut as the ostensible  model and crudest motive for the temple, in terms of its overall form and  architectural members. It also explodes other, more recent theories according  to which the perfect Doric temple sprang—like Pallas Athena fully armed and  ready —without model and precedents solely from the requirements of the  material used, namely, stone. 2 The temple has always remained a pegma, a  fram ew ork in the sense described, whether it was built of wood or stone. Yet  the wooden temple and stone temple as art-forms “developed” neither on  their own nor one from the other, but rather together with pegmas that, as &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The loss of inscription in modern urban architecture and design is part of the loss of identity and meaning. This is why Ian Hamilton Finlay’s work has been so influential in modern landscape design, since it reclaims for inscription a central role in design and place-making. I often recall a conversation I once had with a planner from Stockholm City Council, during which we discussed what typologies of green open space were used in that city, and how topographers and planners distinguished wanted from unwanted open space there.&quot;[Worpole, Ken *Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;One of the styles that can be most clearly observed in the building’s design is Palladian in nature, drawing on the design themes present in the work of Italian architect Andrea Palladio (1508-80), notably the kind of symbolism seen in classical Greek architecture. A famous example of this can be seen in Somerset House, London (above), with the central part of the State House bearing the most obvious parallels with Palladian architecture. In addition, Bulﬁnch’s work evoked the neoclassical styles embodied by the likes of Scottish architect Robert Adam (1728-92), although in a move that evoked themes closer to home, wood was used for the columns in the colonnade, as well as for parts of the stairs and decorative bands on the columns.&quot;[(ed.), Sanne de Boer *How it works book of incredible history*. 7th ed. Imagine Publishing Ltd, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;What is curious is that architecture, built architecture, in its nature is thought to be static, so to propose the possibility of an endlessly changing and iterative model for design destabilizes the very status of the architectural object. Where is architecture situated, in the changing possibilities of form in digital space or the built form, or both?What is the role of the architect in the design process?&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;These specific materials are widely used for safety devices and fire prevention. Such fabrics not only underline Nuno’s unique and innovative approach to new-age textile design but also suggest that subtle beauty, neutral colouring and textural surfaces can be intrinsic to both functional and non-functional textiles (see Nuno online). Braddock and O’Mahony note (1998: 11) that Nuno makes many of their woven fabrics from rough, slub and highly-twisted yarns and that this, in itself, provides the ‘decoration’ for the fabric.&quot;[English, Bonnie *Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;From the perspective of the decorative arts the relationship between maker, user and artist continues to define the essential nature of design. It is the spark that brings skill to life. But although Lorenzo Ghiberti, the goldsmith, sculptor and architect, and rediscoverer of the lost-wax casting process that was used to make the baptistry doors, can also be called a designer, looking at his working methods and ideas does not offer much help in understanding the rather different version of design now practised by Jonathan Ive at Apple, say.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*. Rizzoli Ex Libris, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Smooth exchanges, flows, continuousness, performative surfaces, skins, membranes—these concepts have suffused contemporary culture. They signal a dramatic shift in the problematic relationship between “bodies” and technology. The design tools used in film, architecture, and product design have amplified and accelerated our ability to represent the collapse of nature into technology. Digital 3-D modeling software uses algorithmic formulas to generate form in a kind of autocatalytic system that resembles genetic mutation.&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Aristocrats would use its exuberance in design to flex their riches to visitors, bragging about their wealth and power with architecture, art, and interior design. Brass, gold, gilded surfaces, brocades, marble, and onyx are only some of the opulent materials used to define the language of Baroque design—quite the opposite of using a fibrous and recyclable material like cardboard. Because of this utilitarian quality of cardboard, Jillian’s pieces take on more meaning than simply beautifully constructed ornamentation.&quot;[Zimmer, Lori *The Art of Cardboard: Big Ideas for Creativity, Collaboration, Storytelling, and Reuse*. Rockport Publishers, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;These changes are connected to the lightness of symmetrical forms used in their delicate sculptures. All one sees are pilaster shafts decorated with trophies, candelabras, bandlets, cartouches, friezes covered with emblems, garlands, bucrania, rinceaux, tracery, and capitals carved with sculptures based on human figures. Hence the austere framework of the architecture of antiquity is made to smile and flowery Gothic style with its delicate stone tracery is, in fact, closer to Renaissance style than to Greco-Roman style.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*. Parkstone International, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;These latter were not only applied to the surfaces in decorative patterns, but were frequently interwoven into the fabric as the weaving proceeded, to give quill, a more pleasing design or visual contrast. With the increase in availability of materials and decorative resources, an inevitable result was elaboration of design. Fascination with technical skill also played its part, as well as the dictates of social status and political position.&quot;[J., Dockstader Frederick *Weaving Arts of the North American Indian*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;One of Deskey’s furniture critics also referred to ‘dishonest’ designs, such as those made of metal painted to simulate the appearance of wood, as ‘mongrel’ forms. 72 Interestingly, Dreyfuss’s use of the term resonated with Teague’s concerns, owing to their common interest in the Greek principles of dynamic symmetry. To Dreyfuss, any design that was not geometric in its basic shapes, principles and proportion constituted a ‘mongrel’ form. 73 When ‘mongrel’ designs are contrasted against ‘ideal’ product types, with the difference stemming largely from how closely a product design adhered to what were considered by designers to be the fundamental design laws of nature, it is not surprising that designers insisted upon studying nature and the design of living organisms as the basis for their bringing about ‘pure form’ in streamline product design (such as that exemplified by the blimp or Dreyfuss’s dynamically symmetrical forms). 74 For example, Arens upheld the whale as the best model for ship design, and designers closely studied the intricacies of the salmon and the Pacific plover in order to better understand the streamline adaptations of fishes and birds.&quot;[Brauer, Fae, and Anthea Callen (eds.) *Art, Sex and Eugenics: Corpus Delecti*. Ashgate, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Each style was given a name—“royal” (à la royale), “in the latest style” (à la mode), “French” (à la française), or simply “new”— and on occasion the space for which it had been created was specified (“this new design was used in the private apartments of the Trianon Palace” and so forth). At the origin of interior design, we thus find a practice that is still the bread and butter of decorating magazines, an attempt to give outsiders a feel for how the rich and famous live in their domestic interiors.&quot;[DeJean, Joan *The age of comfort : when Paris discovered casual—and the modern home began*. Bloomsbury USA, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Despite its faults, the New Design chair certainly exhibits imagination. Some techniques of construction and elements of design were traditional in the sense that other craftsmen used them. Some were traditional in that they exhibited techniques and designs employed by Chester&#x27;s forebears or developed by THE MASTERPIECE AND THE NEW DESIGN 79 Chester himself in earlier years and perpetuated to the present. Both the New Design chair and the Bookcase Masterpiece existed and had some of their particular features because of the customers who inspired, influenced, or otherwise affected the craftsman.&quot;[Jones, Michael Owen *Craftsman of the Cumberlands: Tradition and Creativity*. University Press of Kentucky, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;This industrial process allows both texture and form to be created at the same time. Vertical, horizontal and zig-zag pleating is used to create varying effects and architectural shapes (Figure 1. 2). Interview magazine quotes Miyake as saying: ‘Pleats give birth to texture and shape all at the same time. I feel I have found a new way to give individuality to today’s mass-produced clothing’ (Saiki 1992: 34). When Miyake designed dance costumes1 for William Forsythe’s Frankfurt Ballet in 1990, he used ultra feather-light polyester jersey, permanently pleated.&quot;[English, Bonnie *Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo*.

<li>&quot;However, the principle building material in Onyx is basalt. Nearly every building in Onyx (and the rest of the archipelago) is fashioned from the jet black volcanic rock, with wood primarily used today for furniture, roofing and building signs. Roof construction typically consists of a thin layer of teakwood slats covered with obsidian shingles, which cause roofs to glisten darkly in sunlight.&quot;[Alexander, Alan, Eric Brennan, Genevieve Cogman, Conrad Hubbard, and Peter Schaefer *Compass of Terrestrial Directions, Vol.2: The West (Exalted RPG)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Sylvester’s portrait presents the face as three-dimensional, but in so doing can only depict three-fourths of the moko. The portrait thus loses the details, outlined above, that complete Te Pehi’s design, making it a full facial pattern by including the areas alongside the lower and upper jaw line and cheek. Lévi-Strauss takes Te Pehi Kupe’s realism of design rather than realism of face to be representative of an important strand in Māori thought. “In native thought,” Lévi-Strauss declares, “the design is the face, or rather it creates it” (Structural Anthropology, 259).&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*. Columbia University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Spread form Catalog Design. At the same time, Sutnar was not an invisible designer. While his basic structures were decidedly rational, the choices he made in juxtaposition, scale, and color were rooted in sophisticated principles of abstract design, bringing sensitive composition, visual charm, and emotional drama to his workaday subjects. He developed a distinctive vocabulary, or style, notable for arrows, fever lines, black bullets, and other repeated devices. He used all of the above to direct the reader through hierarchies of information, and indeed promoted these devices in Catalog Design Progress as the correct forms for guiding readers (which contributed to a kind of Sutnar-biased conformity among later designers).&quot;[Heller, Steven *The Graphic Design Reader*. Allworth Press, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;These changes represent not decline but adaptation: in the face of a sometimes cataclysmic history of invasion and displacement, artists have long used innovations in technologies and ideas to carry forward the vital traditions of moko. Such responses indicate an active, sometimes defiant, indigenization of new traditions. In one example, a carver used moko to accord honor to a carved figure of Mary and her infant son, Jesus. In 1845, Patoromu Tamatea or another carver created a Madonna for the Catholic Church.&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*. Columbia University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The shifting technological metaphors used to model human bodies show up in several essays. Stephen Mihm and Heather Perry articulate the body of the high mechanical age—when leather, wood, ivory, and rubber were used to approximate the mechanical behavior of joints, sockets, stumps, and muscles. David Serlin and Steven Kurzman show us how in the mid-twentieth century this model was replaced by an engineering or circuitry model, in which designers used electronic and chemical devices to imitate the brain and nervous system through my- 32 KATHERINE OTT FIG.&quot;[Ott, Katherine, David Serlin, and Stephen Mihm *Artificial Parts, Practical Lives: Modern Histories of Prosthetics*. NYU Press, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Then, iron-framed roof structures with infilling supporting lightweight sheets of metal, which had originally been used to roof large buildings, provided a model for huge iron arches. The ropes and lianas used by Indians to cross rivers with steep banks inspired suspension bridges. A combination of iron, cast iron and glass allowed the construction of magnificent galleries full of exotic plants. Solid porte-cochères were replaced with elegant wrought iron.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*. Parkstone International, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Chicago-based artist Jözef Sumichrast uses a sander on his cardboard sculptures to give a velvety surface that fools the eye into thinking it is a much heavier material. Daniel Agdag’s work uses the flexibility of cardboard to make intricate mechanical-inspired models with delicate tiny parts. Agdag emphasizes his imposed value on the material by placing the sculptures under bell jars—which were used to house curiosities and treasures in the Victorian era. The versatility and easy to use quality of cardboard also allows artists to dream big—and make enormous installations with greater ease than working with heavier materials like marble, metal, and wood.&quot;[Zimmer, Lori *The Art of Cardboard: Big Ideas for Creativity, Collaboration, Storytelling, and Reuse*. Rockport Publishers, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, with Jonathan Ive replacing Steve Forstall as head of Apple’s Human Interface team, the reliance on real-world design elements was scaled back for the release of iOS 7 in 2013. Microsoft’s Metro design language, used for Windows 8 and Windows Phone, appears to have been a deliberate attempt to differentiate itself from the skeuomorphic design over-used by Apple, focusing instead on typography and clean, flat design which is ‘authentically digital’. With skeuomorphic elements gradually being replaced by simpler, flatter designs on our tablets and smartphones, what could actually result is a greater appreciation of the physical (the real physical, not just the digital with a leather texture applied over the top).&quot;[Ward, James *Adventures in Stationery: A Journey Through Your Pencil Case*. Profile Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;In his monograph (still used by potters), Chap focused on decorative style, citing the extensive use of a few basic, irreducible design elements. The monograph included over seventy pages of design elements, mimicking the “wallpaper” of drawings that graced Chap’s office. Despite Nusbaum’s support for Chap, their personality styles differed, so it was almost inevitable that the pressures of construction and accountability would trigger seismic rumblings in their friendship. Nusbaum was frustrated when Chap could not be found, or arrived late, for meetings.&quot;[Chapman, Janet, and Karen Barrie *Kenneth Milton Chapman: A Life Dedicated to Indian Arts and Artists*.
