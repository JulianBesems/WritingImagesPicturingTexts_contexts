<li>&quot;Determining who is a design participant sometimes becomes a process of enrollment and reduction of participation and sometimes a process of extending participation in a process of mutual translation where more than one network is enhanced and more than one analysis/ practice is elaborated. Any attempt to draw boundaries and exclude participation is always subject to a factionalization of the power and authority to do so. For this reason, end users of an artifact can be in a position of power with respect to a design by being experienced in the context of its use.&quot;[Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide, Geoffrey Bowker (Ed.), Susan Leigh Star (Ed.), Les Gasser (Ed.), William Turner (Ed.), 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;Moreover, these routines can be represented relatively statically, and they can be improved or changed by some external agent. As Hutchins (1991) has observed, such a classical representation looks at the behavior of a system, represents it explicitly, and searches for a better solution. (This, for instance, lies behind much of the work in process modeling and process re-engineering or work on the implications of group work on organizations). The process of change lies outside the group through the action of some external agent.&quot;[Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide, Geoffrey Bowker (Ed.), Susan Leigh Star (Ed.), Les Gasser (Ed.), William Turner (Ed.), 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;Users with roles Prosecutor and Assistant are assigned to execute the MLA process and activities that are part of the process are represented as tasks (see Figure 1). In this scenario, the task ”Translate Documents” T3 is originally only accessible by the user member of role Prosecutor, a fact deﬁned in the workﬂow policy. We deﬁne a workﬂow policy as a level of deﬁning access to task resources. We denote P an authorisation policy for the MLA process.&quot;[Advanced Information Systems Engineering: 22nd International Conference, CAiSE 2010, Hammamet, Tunisia, June 7-9, 2010.

<li>&quot;This &quot;disagreement&quot; reflects an ongoing debate within the CSCW research community. Ethnographic teclmiqucs help make more visible a dimension of people&#x27;s work, in which they actively, flexibly, and reflexively reform, reorient, and recombine their actions to fit the exigencies of the work as it unfolds. Although the focus on context, situatedness, and contingency is seen as indispensable for an understanding of work practice, there is less agreement on the appropriateness of a process perspective that can be translated into (basically procedural) protocols for action (Simone &amp; Schmidt, 1993).&quot;[Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide, Geoffrey Bowker (Ed.), Susan Leigh Star (Ed.), Les Gasser (Ed.), William Turner (Ed.), 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;However, standard process modeling languages, such as BPMN or UML Activity diagrams [11], do not provide native language constructs to model RBAC elements. Due to missing modeling support for process-related delegation of roles, tasks, and duties, organizations often try to specify delegation processes via informal textual comments. However, such work-arounds easily result in signiﬁcant problems regarding consistency between process descriptions and actual process executions [18], and they make it diﬃcult to translate the respective modeling-level concepts to actual software systems.&quot;[Advanced Information Systems Engineering Workshops: CAiSE 2011 International Workshops, London, UK, June 20-24, 2011.

<li>&quot;This approach was supposed to reduce semantic ambiguity of the agents’ arguments by preserving deep conceptual ramifications, so allowing a more complex concept handling within the process flow. This was a key feature in the process, particularly crucial for a research program focused on supporting decisions in the environmental field -an intrinsically complex domain.&quot;[Cooperative Design, Visualization, and Engineering: First International Conference, CDVE 2004, Palma de Mallorca, Spain, September 19-22, 2004.

<li>&quot;First, we will introduce a definition proposed by the Author (Arciszewski 1977a,b). At this time, the Author was studying cybernetics and was strongly influenced by systems thinking. As a result of this thinking, the engineering designing process was assumed to be a multivariant designing process, which is a complex multistage process with several lines of activities. Each line of activities represents designing activities associated with a different variant of the final design. Some of these lines may need to be terminated before leading to the final designs, as happened with the line “N” in Figure 5. 4.&quot;[Inventive Engineering: Knowledge and Skills for Creative Engineers, Tomasz Arciszewski, 2015]</li>
<li>&quot;Core activities are identified through extensive literature review and interviewing domain experts. We expect the process plays a core role in better understanding project stakeholders’ role, providing a foundation for defining detailed workflows for integrating computational modeling and simulations using digital tools, improving transparency and dependency between activities within the process.&quot;[Computing in Civil Engineering (2012), Flood, Ian; Issa, R. Raymond, 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;Likewise, the bi-directionality of exchanging information stored on paper and electronic media will make increasing use of graphic recognition capabilities. Overall, a technology that was originally motivated by the pressing need to convert paper documents containing graphics into electronic formats is becoming more and more useful in a variety of information technology domains never before thought of. Once the technology becomes mature enough, one can envision a team of humans working with robots, where both humans and robots read the same graphical document (displayed on any media) and coordinate their tasks based on understanding the same document.&quot;[Graphics Recognition Methods and Applications: First International Workshop University Park, PA, USA, August 10–11, 1995 Selected Papers, Lawrence O&#x27;Gorman (auth.), Rangachar Kasturi, Karl Tombre (eds.), 1996]</li>
