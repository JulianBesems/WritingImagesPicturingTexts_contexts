    <pre>Both of the multi-modal screens sit within the dimensions corresponding to the multi-modal documents that make up the domain. As an example we will describe the multi-modal structure based on the 216 films described in 3.3. However any other collection of multi-modal documents as described in 3.3 would follow the same process in establishing the 2 operative screens.</pre>

      <li>&quot;The latter problem also arises frequently, and may be looked upon as a special case of the former, the objects under comparison here being ideas. But the comparison is undertaken in the way that has just been described. But since an idea is quite different from its object, it should come as no surprise if the comparison of ideas reveals completely different similarities and differences than those obtaining between their objects. Thus the ideas &quot;equilateral triangle&quot; and &quot;equiangular triangle&quot; differ, but the objects they represent are the same.&quot;[Bolzano, Bernard *Theory of Science*.

<li>&quot;From this definition, I believe I may infer that this scholar connects roughly the same concept with these words as I do, only I suppose that there are images not only for concepts of genera and species, but also for any genuine or even merely supposed object-idea. Nor do all the ideas of which an image is composed have to be intuitions. Rather, some are concepts, since intuitions can only enter into combinations to form new ideas with the help of concepts. Note 4. According to these definitions there is an unmistakable difference between the sense of the word &quot;image&quot; [Bild] and another used in poetry, when certain fictions [Dichtungen] are given the name of (poetic) images.&quot;[Bolzano, Bernard *Theory of Science*. Oxford University Press, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;If we review the rules given in §361 for finding ideas subordinate to a given one, we see that they would serve equally well for finding an idea that overlaps with a given one. Among the collections of attributes that we know a thing to have, we seek those for which the following three ideas are objectual: [Something]( a+ m), [Something]( a+ non m), and [Something](non a+ m). Then Mand A certainly stand in a relation of overlapping. If the idea B that is subordinate to the idea A is composed of A and other parts, say as [A]p, it is natural to ask first whether the idea P would itself yield an idea that stands 444 in the required relation of overlapping.&quot;[Bolzano, Bernard *Theory of Science*. Oxford University Press, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;It would be much simpler to understand the process, if adding new strokes made the first one visible. There would then be two different objects apperceived as totals, -- paper with one stroke, paper with two strokes; and, blind to the former, he would see all that was in the latter, because he would have apperceived it as a different total in the first instance. A process of this sort occurs sometimes (not always) when the new strokes, instead of Being mere repetitions of the original one, are lines which combine with it into a total effect, say a human face.&quot;[James, William *Principles of Psychology*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Were we on an infinite plane, we would no longer be perceptually &quot; interested&quot; in that &quot; plane. We would say The world is composedof n holes,&quot; and n would be the total number of perceptual units (not n + 1: the plane would not be an . 11 Figure &#x27;s11 -profilereversible Rubin vase . figure Figure11. 12 TheSeaof Holes . 170 Chapter 11 Figure11. 13 A hole, an island. additional unit ). Thus, one could accept the issue of dominating gestalts and yet deny that substancesare the sole dominating units.&quot;[Casati, Roberto, and Achille C. Varzi *Holes and Other Superficialities (Bradford Books)*. 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;It would be impossible for us to tell a properly persisting object from an object like a, which is temporally scatteredbut rapidly oscillating in existence(in the sensethat a continuous processis cinematographically representedby a successionof static frames). If a had a hole in it , a properly persisting object could be kept there. It seems, then, that the continuity of function would be ensured, and that this would settle the question of the hole&#x27;s survival. But the analogy is misleading, for a and the hole in it would be unable to keepat its place another temporally scatteredobject that existed at the times at which a did not and that moved relative to a.&quot;[Casati, Roberto, and Achille C. Varzi *Holes and Other Superficialities (Bradford Books)*. 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;Examples of modes are the idea of a dance, the idea of beauty (p. 17). When talking of abstract ideas, he speaks of conceiving a quantity or quality, and of forming a notion of degrees of these. He also cites the ideas of the length of a line, or the idea of a precise degree of any quantity or quality (pp. 18-19). Ideas are said to be joined in the conception. These ideas have their appearance in the mind (p. 19). Another example of the copying of impressions by ideas is given: what is absurd in fact and reality is absurd in idea also.&quot;[Yolton, John W. *Perceptual Acquaintance from Descartes to Reid*. 1984.]</li>
<li>&quot;He may be taken to draw a contrast between having a distinct idea of large numbers and forming the images that represent things. But he also moves back and forth between &#x27;idea&#x27; and &#x27;image&#x27;, so we should be cautious when drawing an inference about such a contrast. He even occasionally speaks of images or impressions (p. 27), although this passage is concerned with showing the similarity between a sensible minimum and the minimum of the imagination. He asserts the mind&#x27;s ability to form very tiny ideas, ideas of tiny objects, e. g. , the idea of the smallest atom of the animal spirits (p. 28).&quot;[Yolton, John W. *Perceptual Acquaintance from Descartes to Reid*. 1984.]</li>
<li>&quot;Under this of composition may be reckoned also that of ENLARGING, wherein, though the composition does not so much appear as in more complex ones, yet it is nevertheless a putting several ideas together, though of the same kind. Thus, by adding several units together, we make the idea of a dozen; and putting together the repeated ideas of several perches, we frame that of a furlong. 7. Brutes compound but little. In this also, I suppose, brutes come far short of man. For, though they take in, and retain together, several combinations of simple ideas, as possibly the shape, smell, and voice of his master make up the complex idea a dog has of him, or rather are so many distinct marks whereby he knows him; yet I do not think they do of themselves ever compound them, and make complex ideas.&quot;[Locke, John *Complete Works of John Locke*. Delphi Classics, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The simple ideas thus united in the same [complex idea of an] object are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different senses. (II:II:1) Now this is a contention with which a Gestalt psychologist would take issue; and it would not seem to be a logical consequence of Locke’s causal theory of perception. For even if we have the ideas we do as the result of the action of objects on our senses, it is still true that it usually takes a good deal of effort to sort out the various ‘simple’ ideas which make up a single complex perception.&quot;[Schacht, Richard *Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant*. New edition. Routledge, 1984.]</li>
<li>&quot;But the idea of the object is not two realities; it is one reality with a double cause. An idea cannot be identified without its content. Even if ideas were entities for Descartes, they would not be two entities. If ideas are in fact activities, the temptation to take the content of these activities as an entity may fade. And if, as I have suggested, the causation of the esse objectivum is semantic, this temptation may disappear entirely. The reality of the object in the idea is the meaning, the cognitive meaning, of the object.&quot;[Yolton, John W. *Perceptual Acquaintance from Descartes to Reid*. 1984.]</li>
<li>&quot;Indeed, perspectival representation itself makes its appearance differently here than earlier: in the intimate space, the arbitrary position of the viewer (and the painter) becomes more obvious. They hardly need to move for everything to appear in another projection; the facial features and hands would be different, the pieces of furniture would be located in different places, the slippers would end up farther away.&quot;[Földényi, László F., and Tim Wilkinson (Translator) *Melancholy*. Yale University Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;(ibid ) Surely this criterion is too weak for us. For instance, it would have the &#x27; consequencethat even a moving red patch on a cube s side would qualify as a disturbance. Holes are disturbancesof a more substantial, geometrically relevant sort. Surfaces , potential surfaces, and parts. We would like to talk of these disturbing entities as of individuals - as opposed to , say, properties or other abstractions. There might be some awkwardnessin considering an individual &#x27;s (proper) parts as individuals in their own right , for this would imply that every individual carries along with it an infinitv of other individuals .&quot;[Casati, Roberto, and Achille C. Varzi *Holes and Other Superficialities (Bradford Books)*. 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;In ideal cases, those three points of view would match seamlessly, which is to say that diseases stemming from similar causes would be found to have the same symptoms, and the same changes would be observed in the cadavers (Kraepelin, Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie, 314). 13 The use of the conditional mode is telling: Kraepelin fixed his eyes on an ideal future in which every case would be closed and shut; framing the statement in the future tense refers to a utopia that lurks at the bottom of all systematizations.&quot;[Földényi, László F., and Tim Wilkinson (Translator) *Melancholy*.
