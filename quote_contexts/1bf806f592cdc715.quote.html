    <pre>When Vitruvious talks about the education of the Architects, he portrays the complexity of architecture as being provided by its inherent multi-facetted nature - *“Let him be educated, skilful with the pencil, instructed in geometry, know much history, have followed the philosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of medicine, know the opinions of the jurists, and be acquainted with astronomy and the theory of the heavens.”* Yet the prevailing computational encoding habits tend to confine mediation to geometry, letting the non-geometrical dimensions of architecture fall through the cracks. It does not allow for the integration of the theoretical, cultural, literary, atmospheric, philosophical and associative dimensions of architectural design or for the flexibility of the design as an idea when mediated by the designer. The consequence of this is not just representational; it is epistemic. Architecture risks forgetting how its media think.</pre>

      <li>&quot; ipulation of the final artefact, the purpose of preliminary studies  being to give sufficient definition for final work to begin, not to  provide a complete determination in advance, as in architectural  drawing. The resulting displacement of effort and indirectness of  access still seem to me to be distinguishing features of conventional  architecture considered as a visual art, but whether always and neces?sarily disadvantageous is another question. Two divergent definitions of the possibilities for architecture  follow from the recognition of this displacement.&quot;[INPUT: [AA Files 1986-sum iss. 12] Robin Evans - TRANSLATIONS FROM DRAWING TO BUILDING (1986) [10.2307_29543512] - libgen.li.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;There is something stony in a work of architecture, wooden in a carving, colored in a painting, spoken in a linguistic work, sonorous in a musical composition. The thingly element is so irremovably present in the art work that we are compelled rather to say conversely that the architectural work is in stone, the carving is in wood, the painting in color, the linguistic work in speech, the musical composition in sound. &quot;Obviously,&quot; it will be replied. No doubt. But what is this self-evident thingly element in the work of art?&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;If all art is in essence poetry, then the arts of architecture, painting, sculpture, and music must be traced back to poesy. That is pure arbitrariness. It certainly is, as long as we mean that those arts are varieties of the art of language, if it is permissible to characterize poesy by that easily misinterpretable title. But poesy is only The Origin of the Work of Art $) 71 one mode of the lighting projection of truth, i. e. , of poetic composition in this wider sense. Nevertheless, the linguistic work, the poem in the narrower sense, has a privileged position in the domain of the arts.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;This insight and understanding are brought about by the arts in general on the plane of feeling and emotion, whence “art is the creation of forms symbolic of 612 The Contemporary Period human feeling. ”But music in particular is the presentational form par excellence, for its “tonal structures . . . bear a close logical similarity to the forms of human feeling. ” This analysis, begun in Philosophy in a New Key, is extended in Langer’s later work, Feeling and Form. For Langer, then, the human being is both receiver and communicator.&quot;[Historical introduction to philosophy, Hakim, Albert, 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;Art works universally display a thingly character, The Origin of the Work of Art $0 39 albeit in a wholly distinct way. The attempt to interpret this thingcharacter of the work with the aid of the usual thing-concepts failed—not only because these concepts do not lay hold of the thingly feature, but because, in raising the question of its thingly substructure, we force the work into a preconceivedframeworkby which we obstruct our own access to the work-being of the work. Nothing can be discovered about the thingly aspect of the work so long as the pure self-subsistence of the work has not distincdy displayed itself.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;We are now confronted by a remarkable result of our considerations—if it still deserves to be called a result at all. Two points become clear: First: the dominant thing-concepts are inadequate as means of grasping the thingly aspect of the work. Second: what we tried to treat as the most immediate reality of the work, its thingly substructure, does not belong to the work in that way at all. As soon as we look for such a thingly substructure in the work, we have imwittingly taken work as equipment, to which we then also ascribe a superstructure supposed to contain its artistic quality.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;To be sure. The distinction of matter and form is the conceptual The Origin of the Work of Art $j) 27 schema which is used, in the greatest variety of ways, quite generally for all art theory and aesthetics. This incontestable fact, however, proves neither that the distinction of matter and form is adequately founded, nor that it belongs originally to the domain of art and the art work. Moreover, the range of application of this pair of concepts has long extended far beyond thefieldof aesthetics. Form and content are the most hackneyed concepts under which anything and everything may be subsumed.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;The work&#x27;s createdness, however, can obviously be grasped only in terms of the process of creation. Thus, constrained by the facts, we must consent after all to go into the activity of the artist in order to arrive at the origin of the work of art. The attempt to define the work-being of the work purely in terms of the work itself proves to be unfeasible. In turning away now from the work to examine the nature of the creative process, we should like nevertheless to keep in mind what was said first of the picture of the peasant shoes and later of the Greek temple.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;Anyone can easily see that we are moving in a circle. Ordinary understanding demands that this circle be avoided because it violates logic. What art is can be gathered from a comparative examination of actual art works. But how are we to be certain that we are indeed basing such an examination on art works if we do not know beforehand what art is?And the nature of art can no more be arrived at by a derivation from higher concepts than by a collection of characteristics of actual art works. For such a derivation, too, already has in view the characteristics that must suffice to establish that what we take in advance to be an art work is one in fact.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;Thus, given the experience of this work of art as beautiful, the effort to discover why this is so is what the philosophy of art is all about. An example of an entirely different texture is had in language—our ordinary everyday use of words. Our experience is generally one of satisfaction that by the words we use and the sentences we fashion we can communicate with others in speech and writing. The questions we raise usually refer to grammar or style.&quot;[Historical introduction to philosophy, Hakim, Albert, 2016]</li>
