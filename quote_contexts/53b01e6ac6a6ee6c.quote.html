      <li>&quot;The fact that the colour on the walls alters when a cloud passes over the sun and looks different throughout the day or even across the seasons is what makes the paint feel alive. It is this quality that gives an interior a unique sense of depth and atmosphere. Second, it is preferable to look at the colour in the correct light. If you are decorating a space used exclusively at night, such as a dining room, you may want to view the colour by candlelight. Third, it is often useful to see the colour in relation to the decorative scheme of an adjoining space – these subtle tones are best perceived in context rather than in isolation.&quot;[Studholme, Joa, and Charlotte Cosby *Farrow &amp; Ball How to Decorate: Transform Your Home with Paint &amp; Paper*. Mitchell Beazley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Le Corbusier decided to place different types of glass in these openings: clear glass, coloured glass, and glass painted with simple motifs, some of which bear inscriptions of praise to the Holy Virgin. The architect’s decision to use clear glass and to splash only a few precise places with touches of colour corresponds to his wish to keep a tight rein on the use of light – a primordial element in the definition of the interior volumes. The colours employed are the same as those for the door: blue, red, yellow, green and violet.&quot;[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Colour can also modify an architectural space or indeed completely transform it. In creating an atmosphere, colour plays an active part and was employed in this work by the architect to characterise certain points of the interior space: here colour is not a mere addition, but rather an element of the architecture itself, or indeed still more, for it is a functional component of the architecture, understood and employed for its spatial value and psychological impact.&quot;[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;But even under dullyovercast conditions the light has an incandescent quality, seemingly brighter than intuition would allow. Artificial light is not regarded as a merely functional night-time substitute for daylight and sunlight. From all viewpoints the interior is punctuated by hand-made, clear glass lamps, suspended from the vaults or spaced upon the walls. These are lit at most times, regardless of the quantity of natural light, and with their pin-point brightness, add a further dimension to the nature and meaning of the interior.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The condition is exacerbated when the building’s windows are glazed in tinted glass. Light and colour God created the heavens and the Earth in the very beginning…(and) God said ‘Let there be light’ (Genesis 1:1, 3) We shall do well then to consider this potential and beautiful principle of light and its concomitant colours, for the more deeply we penetrate into its inner laws, the more would it present itself as a marvellous storehouse of power to vitalise, heal, reﬁne and delight mankind.

<li>&quot;Factors that help to induce a sense of ‘place’, therefore, are given particular consideration. One of the most effective of these factors is light, to the extent that light and space are inseparable and that when light is eliminated from a space the emotional content of space disappears. The essence of architectural space lies in the interaction of the elements that define it. We can observe the relevance of the indivisible interplay of space and light in the case of the courtyard house.&quot;[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Rooms, to adapt a Shaker phrase, became “clothed with the sun, which typifies divine light. ”30 For the same reason, yellow-painted window reveals bring to mind a halo, nimbus, or aureole, as do, more abstractly, the yellow trim and peg rails outlining white plaster. With so much radiation captured and shining in simple rooms, one can readily think of the Shaker interior as a construct of light as much as matter, a construct able to satisfy the “pleading” of the Shaker “soul” for “a nearer relation to its Creator and for light, more light. ”31 Reinforcing this impression is a close correspondence between the Shakers&#x27; own rainbow-like palette—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, playing off a brilliant white ground—and the colors of light found in the sky.&quot;[Plummer, Henry *Stillness and Light: The Silent Eloquence of Shaker Architecture*. Indiana University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Rectilinear rooms painted white can even ‘sound’ louder than when painted in a different colour. Colours, lighting, textures, the ﬂow of air and the actual proportions and shapes of the interior rooms have a sum total impact on the mind, body and spirit of all those who enter the building. Ideally, an overall lighting scheme should aim to counter the lack of daylight to provide good colour rendition, low brightness and a system of polarisation to reduce glare.&quot;[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;The envelope thus becomes a diffuse and magical light source, neither opaque nor transparent, neither wall nor window. The effect is to invest the space with a surrounding glow within which the stronger zenithal illumination is tempered and focused (Figure 7. 11). The defining walls of the Roman remains are set against black cloth backdrops that absorb the light and, by contrast, make the ancient stones luminous. Under bright sunlight the black painted interiors of the rooflight enclosures appear brightly reflectant.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;1. 1. 2 Sunlight A key decision early in the design stage is the degree to which sunlight should be allowed to enter the building. This will depend on the type of activity within the building and the climate of its location. It is important to recognise the benefits of sunlight. Sunlight increases the overall level of light and helps to provide a constant variation in the intensity, pattern and colour of light (see Figure 1. 3). There is little doubt that entering a sunlit space is a pleasing experience and the interior of the great cathedrals, where the rays of the sun create shafts of light, is Figure 1. 3 Sunlight entering the Director’s Room, Glasgow Museum of Art.&quot;[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*. Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;A simpler form has sometimes been adopted to aid the understanding of the terms involved. A full technical glossary is given in the CIBSE Code for interior lighting (27). Colour rendering is a general expression for the appearance of surface colours when illuminated by light from a given source compared, consciously or unconsciously, with their appearance under light from some reference source. Good colour rendering implies similarity of appearance to being under daylight. Artificial sky A chamber or room in which models of buildings are placed to test their daylighting characteristics.&quot;[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*. Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;Throughout the year the sun sends its glaring light during the long hours of the Middle Eastern day. Even in the dark nights of Mesopotamia, light sent by the moon’s brightness or even by the distant stars is sufficient for the creation of a sense of space, although one imbued with mystery. The natural response made by the Sumerians, therefore, was the development of an instinctive space conception tied to natural light—which led to the organisation of the inner court as a way of harnessing the light without the climatic disadvantage of heat gain.&quot;[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, as the light fades, the colour on the panelling will feel stronger, creating a more cocoon-like space. THIS PAGE The simplicity of this space makes it so appealing for sitting in and working. No artwork is required on this expansive wall, which is painted in ‘Cornforth White’, because the extraordinary top light creates shadows of rare beauty. These, together with the paint colour, will change and excite throughout the course of the day. FACING PAGE FACING PAGE Few rooms are filled with such enormous amounts of natural light as this Parisian example.&quot;[Studholme, Joa, and Charlotte Cosby *Farrow &amp; Ball How to Decorate: Transform Your Home with Paint &amp; Paper*. Mitchell Beazley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;In addition to avoiding the overuse of artiﬁcial light and the heat generated by artiﬁcial light ﬁxtures, rooms with daylight also beneﬁt their occupants, who appreciate experiencing the dynamic qualities of natural light as it changes throughout the day. In general, light ﬁxtures are designed not to be noticed; however, designs that conceal the light source limit the perceptible qualities of ﬁre as light. Unlike ﬁre, artiﬁcial light ﬁxtures cannot offer perceptible experiences of heat, sound or smell to the senses, but when make visible, they offer a sense of orientation and direction.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;The fascination which glass inspires in designers is explained by its aesthetics and functions. Its transparency, affording both light and vision yet imposing separation and even isolation worth appreciating. It can, do the very opposite as well. Glass can form building’s envelope as opaque as stone, reflecting images and allowing light to reach the interior, without compromising vision through to the exterior. Glass can also provide a delicate covering that softens a building’s mass, or indeed accentuate it, by simply reflecting both light and the surrounding environment.&quot;[Garg, N.K. *Guidelines for Use of Glass in Buildings*. New Age Publications (Academic), 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;The whiteness is neither uniform nor sterile, however, for a varied interplay of source and surface produces a thousand subtle, almost indefinable tones. As a result, rooms do not appear superficially bright, but seem to have soaked up light, as if taking possession of falling rays and wedding them into their own substance. Central Hallway Center Family Dwelling House South Union, Kentucky Plaster Vaulting Center Family Dwelling House Pleasant Hill, Kentucky YELLOW LIGHT The luminous yellow paint used routinely on woodwork by early Shakers, set of by slightly dimmer yellow-oranges and yellow-reds, conveys a belief in color as materialized light.&quot;[Plummer, Henry *Stillness and Light: The Silent Eloquence of Shaker Architecture*. Indiana University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Good lighting can create a warm atmosphere, highlight a beautiful object or transform the character of an interior by introducing areas of light and shadow. Bleak, overhead and bare light bulbs make a space seem unfriendly and unrelaxing, while a few table lamps or uplights can make a room seem soothing and welcoming. Light that’s too bright just dazzles and drains, and a dim, dark room is depressing. There are three different types of lighting: Renno Planner pages 23/6/05 2:13 PM Page 112 112—planning your perfect home renovation ■ Atmospheric—Ambient or atmospheric refers to a room’s overall lighting and the mood it creates.&quot;[May, Alex *Planning Your Perfect Home Renovation: Save time and money with this essential guide to fuss-free home improvements*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;The same reciprocity exists when considering the building’s exterior. The window reframes the exterior at the same time as it remakes the interior. We have seen this already in the case of Le Corbusier’s landscape drawings and the paintings of both Dufy and Matisse: the window is both passive and active, a receptacle and an instrument. If marginal (to the exterior view or qualities of interior light), it is also productive, “coming against, beside, and in addition [to the work done], not falling to one side, it touches and cooperates within the operation, from a certain outside .&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Painting several areas versus just one will give you the truest representation, because while paint reacts one way to direct sunlight, it can look completely different in softer, diffused light. Live with the patches for a few days and watch how they change from morning to night. Quality paint will take on different hues at different times of day. working with (or without) light There are likely some rooms in your home that are blasted with daylight and others that rely solely on artificial light. Common knowledge would have it that dark rooms should be painted in light colors to counteract their natural dimness.&quot;[Mayhew, Elizabeth *Flip! for Decorating  A Page-by-Page, Piece-by-Piece, Room-by-Room Guide to Transforming Your Home*. Ballantine Books, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Carpeting, draperies, furniture, lighting, paint, wall coverings, and many other items contribute to the creation of an interior. Interior decoration involves the careful selection of each item to suit the area&#x27;s purpose and the overall mood desired. Most people think of interior decoration in terms of decorating the rooms of a house or apartment. But professionals called interior designers $ also plan and create interiors for hotels and motels, hospitals, libraries, office buildings, post offices, schools, and stores.&quot;[Н.М., Філіппова, and Смуглякова М.К. *Focus on Design. Part Two. Interior Design*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The exterior of the house is clad in charcoal-coloured fibre-cement panels which render the house almost invisible when seen against the dark green foliage of the fir trees. Interiors are described by a luminous inner lining made of translucent acrylic panels. Over forty skylights bring sunlight into roof and wall assemblies during the day which causes this interior liner to glow softly; while at night, fluorescent lights mounted within the skylight openings turn the entire interior into a luminous field.&quot;[Liu, Helen *Residential Skin &amp; Details*. DesignMedia Publishing Limited, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;The other parts of the light in the spectrum are absorbed or Jess readily transmitted. The intensity of the colour depends on the amount of colouring agent, e. g. cobalt oxide, present in the glass. 42 THE INFLUENCE OF GLASS THICKNESS ON LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE There are many different methods by which colours can be defined. Spectral transmittance curves give accurate definitions of coloured glasses. Such transmittance curves are shown in Figure 5. 1 and Figure 5. 4. 100 90 ~Cll 80 g ~ 60 ·e Ill ~ ~ V\ 70 5o f---- 40 30 f---20 f--10 f--- v\1~\ I 11\ I I I I I I 1 ,, \:. __ l•\ -\ 1/4 in Grey glass , v ~ &#x27;) &#x27; F-&quot; ~ w~ .&quot;[(auth.), Rune Persson *Flat Glass Technology*.

<li>&quot;Many designers use the term tran-sitionalto describe an interior decorated in a combination of period and contemporary styles. 2. Color and Light What colour combinations are the examples of complementary colour scheme?How can different uses of colour change the size of a room?They together may be used in many ways to produce different effects. Dark-colored walls, for example, may absorb the light and make a room dimly lit. However, the same amount of light will appear brighter in a room with pale-colored walls because pale colors reflect light.&quot;[Н.М., Філіппова, and Смуглякова М.К. *Focus on Design. Part Two. Interior Design*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;This isolates the interior spaces from the exterior walls, preventing the transfer of noise and vibration. (Photo courtesy of Undercurrent Architects) The building shell is made from weathered steel that fits in with the industrial nature of the area. With limited surrounding area views, a large skylight provides views of the sky and the distant treetops, while also flooding the interior with light. The central atrium is brightly lit by the natural light coming in through the glass roof.&quot;[Koones, Sheri *Prefabulous World: Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Homes Around the Globe*. Abrams, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Tinted glass possesses filtering properties that help reduce eyestrain due to dazzle. Its absorption properties help diminish energy transmissions when exposed to sunlight. Tints like green allows more visible light and cut out infra-red radiation. Selenium Pink, red Variations in the thickness of the glass would yield different performance in terms of light and solar radiation transmission. Although darker shades reduce the amount of heat being transmitted to the interiors, they also reduce the amount of transmitted daylight.&quot;[Garg, N.K. *Guidelines for Use of Glass in Buildings*.
