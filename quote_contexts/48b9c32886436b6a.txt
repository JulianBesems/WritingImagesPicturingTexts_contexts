Selected: First, the implicit power of formal generalizations does not show up in a correspondingly streamlined linguistic output. Second, the projected complexity of language acquisition is troubling if compared with its apparent ease and phenomenal rate of effective success. A unique focus on formal properties, as widely practiced in linguistic thinking, cannot hope to explain this constellation short of projecting much of language onto a comprehensive, but opaque plane of universal, hard-wired invariability.[Wanner, Dieter *The Power of Analogy: An Essay on Historical Linguistics*.

05. "A disambiguated for- mal language is required for the purposes of formalization, abstract represen- tation and mathematical analysis of the semantics of natural language, as we learned in practicing translations of English to predicate logic. Interpretation in mathematical models or translation to a formal language disambiguates natural language expressions, which is prerequisite for an account of rea- soning and inference in ordinary language use. Our choice of mathematical methods should be determined by the kind of phenomena we want to study: for some quantificational ambiguities predicate logic is suitable, but for opac- ity phenomena different mathematical methods may provide analytical tools suited to different kinds of opacity."[B.H., Partee, Meulen A.T., and Wall R.E. *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics*. 1990.]

06. "Many-sorted languages represent only an inessential extension of the concept hitherto expounded, provided the sorts are given equal rights.

07. "This property emerges from the formal architecture of the system and not from any particular linguistic or processing constraint. We call this property Indirectly Constrained Recursion (ICR), suggesting a new perspective on recursion in language. ICR is a formal structural constraint and not a linguistic or processing constraint."[Roeper, Tom, and Margaret Speas (eds.) *Recursion: Complexity in Cognition*. Springer International Publishing, 2014.]

08. "There are two dangers in this approach. By adding more and more operators to cope with different examples the language becomes increasingly complicated. This criticism might be levelled at CTL* in [EH], Moreover by simply adding a new operator one cannot be sure that the new language is sufficiently expressive to capture all the interesting phenomena of a general transition system. Criteria, independent of program logics, are required."[(auth.), José Luis Balcázar, M. P. Chytil, and V.

11. "It distinguishes itself from similar systems by allowing recursion under representation-level λ-binders while permitting a natural style of programming which we believe scales to other logical frameworks. Sample programs include bracket abstraction, parallel reduction, and an evaluator for a simple language with ﬁrst-class continuations. 1 Introduction Higher-order abstract syntax refers to the technique of using a meta-language, or logical framework, to encode an object language in such a way that variables of the object language are represented by the variables of the logical framework."[(auth.), Thierry Coquand, and Paweł Urzyczyn (eds.) *Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications: 7th International Conference, TLCA 2005, Nara, Japan, April 21-23, 2005.
