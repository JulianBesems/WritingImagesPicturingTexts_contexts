    <pre>For example, a marble runner within a wooden floor could form a pathway through a hall and into a living space, perhaps continuing to the fireplace or window; or in a kitchen, dark wood set into a poured-resin floor could be echoed by a worktop or cabinets of the same wood.

One night when I went out to drink water from the garden tap, I heard a long-haul truck barreling along a distant freeway, and another time, as steam rose around my dishwater, I felt the floor rumble with a passing train. The total whiteness is an effacement, an obliterationa neutral element, like a road leading to a place of rest. It is as if one were in a cavern, hidden away, a place where one rediscovers ones origins and roots.

<em>The pomegranate&#x27;s seeds seemed to scatter, like tiny stars, across the wooden table, and I felt a sudden urge to hold one in my palm, to roll it back and forth, to listen to its small, dry rhythm. As I stood there, a faint scent of damp earth wafted through the open window, carrying with it the whispered promise of winter&#x27;s arrival. Outside, the darkness was slowly yielding to the first hints of dawn, and I felt the weight of the night slowly lifting, like the gentle uncoiling of a spring.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Reading in my hut one autumn evening, the sudden sound of a pomegranate cracking open riveted my attention. One night when I went out to drink water from the garden tap, I heard a long-haul truck barreling along a distant freeway, and another time, as steam rose around my dishwater, I felt the floor rumble with a passing train.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*.

<li>&quot;This joining was neither direct nor traditional, however. With the vertical window, the connections between inside and outside were naturalized in at least two ways: (1) by paralleling the form of the window with the upright posture of the viewer’s body, and (2) by instituting an inhabitable space in the thickness of the window wall, making an experiential threshold between street and room. 8 The horizontal window, on the contrary, instituted a virtual connection and a physical separation between landscape and interior; its thin glass plane served as a mechanism for framing the panorama of nature, rendering it artiﬁcial on and through the surface of the ribbon window.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Inside, a window open to the sky brings the weather inside. “To filter the light, I hoist the sail, like a sailor: a large piece of linen is pulled up, thanks to the help of nautical tools—ropes, pulleys, and a boat cleat.&quot;[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;. . If one can find stillness in the midst of the city turmoil, why should one then forego such an easily accessible spot and seek a more distant one?10 A typical Chinese gentleman kept at least some portion of his walled-in garden as wilderness and while he went into the streets as a civil servant by day, at night he returned to become a mountain recluse.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*.

<li>&quot;But after 29 Interval: The Hut in the Backyard Tree trunks and falling leaves became passionate vignettes Primitive Huts 30 The square window where kettle and bowl were finally at rest 31 Interval: The Hut in the Backyard I frequently found myself sitting at the doorway, scribbling in my notebook, I filled the opening with a window, and below it a small writing shelf.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*.

<li>&quot;The name of the gateway is written above it: “Moment”. ’ Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 1883. trans. Hollingdale) Informal Occupation of Doorways Like the old man in Borges’s story, and notwithstanding Mongolian superstitions, we all find ourselves at one time or another occupying a doorway, on the step between one place and another.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;A shed in the countryside offers a refuge from the agoraphobia of the landscape. Cells Remember what it feels like to go into a garden shed (above). It is like going inside your own head.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Winter may present challenges for access, but the solitude 259 Prospect and Refuge Much like our animal ancestors, human beings like to seek a place of refuge in a well-protected enclosure from which they can look out over the surrounding terrain.&quot;[Mulfinger, Dale *The Family Cabin: Inspiration for Camps, Cottages, and Cabins*. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The southern prow-like space is, in effect, a giant, sun-filled bay window, equipped with layers of timber-louvred screens to control the sun. Here the warmth of the sun may be enjoyed on clear, cold days and in summer, with the windows thrown open, it may become a verandah.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Moisture steams the windows inside this cupola of the barn previous pictured. These windows open to ventilate the building. To dress up this carriage barn, its owners decided on a relatively simple window trim.&quot;[Starr, Markham *Barns of Connecticut*. Wesleyan, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;One of the most haunting scenes in Fire Walk With Me develops when she returns home from school one afternoon. How a room is revealed to us is a critical architectural question.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Velvet, fur and cashmere are ideal for the winter months, while linens, cottons and sheers have a lighter feel. Layering cushions on beds is a design signature of mine and here, one in dark taupe velvet supports a smaller one of ivory linen with a silver silk-velvet band.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]</li>
