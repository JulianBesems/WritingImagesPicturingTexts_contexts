02. "*Cleverly arranged on a sheet of paper, signs invoke the very thing of which they speak-from outside, by the margin theyoutline, by the emergence of their mass on the blank space of the page.* — **This however is almost more like the current encoding of two domains into one space - like clip.

03. "*From knowing as activity we were led to knowledge, from positive knowledge, we return to perceptive activity, as if the communication (of substances)-expression (representation)signification-object (phenomenon)-essence cycle was indifferently plunged into the order of the subjective or that of the objectifiable; or as if the domain where the subject is active and passive was a cycle of representations in the same way as the domain where objects express themselves to each other, that is to say are significant, and are.* [01a. en (gpt)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR3KDWYV?page=40&annotation=3NZIJG5L)"

05. "*There is a large body of multimodal research that explores the dynamics of the interaction between image and language.* — **Interesting but to me it seems to fall into the same pitfalls where meaning is seen as a singularly defined unifying mapping of the modalities. However this fails to acknowledge that the modalities need to remain in their domain to bear this meaning. This collapsing them and studying them by means of analysing meaning seems odd to me. However further and closer reading is needed.

Primary argument is that our approach is an active one where it navigates domains to put something forward which inherently relies on a different approach where this research is employing an analytical method to study how understanding is derived from multimodal sources .

"*When, in a film, the camera is trained on an object and moves nearer to it to give a close-up view, we can remember that we are being shown the ash tray or an actor’s hand, we do not actually identify it.* [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=103&annotation=QXVGWJGB)"

07. "*By looking at objects through the levels of their abstractions, we realize the potency of information (in meaning and shapes, with which we can work), but at the same time we realize the sheer emptiness that is proper to abstraction, when we regard it on the symbolical level of indexes alone.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt & Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=22&annotation=6ES6TMHH)"

08. "*This is because the screen has no horizons.
