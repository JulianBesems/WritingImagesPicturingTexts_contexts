      <li>&quot;The first stair had 12 steps with a riser height of 18. 5 cm and a tread depth of 23. 0 cm. The second stair also had 12 steps with 17. 5 and 25. 0 cm riser height and tread depth, respectively. For the third stair, there were 15 steps with a riser height of 15. 7 cm and a tread depth of 26. 7 cm. Finally, the fourth stair had nine steps and their dimensions were 15. 2 by 33. 2 cm for the riser height and tread depth, respectively.&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A.

<li>&quot;Other dimensions apply to curved stairs 16 . Other factors relevant to stair safety include lighting, slip resistance, single steps (most codes prohibit flights of fewer than three steps), handrails, and inability to detect the edge of the tread due to lack of contrast.

<li>&quot;Equation A. 19 is to be used for one story with three flights of stairs. The authors found that speeds decreased as density increased. These observations were made under normal use and most of the observations were at lighter densities since densities nearing the maximum were very rare. They proposed equation for descending stairs was: s= (112 · d ( 4 − 380 · d 3 + 434 · d 2 − 217 · d + 57 · 0. 775 + 0. 44 · e where: s = speed (m/s) d = density (m2/m2) (−0. 39· d ) ) ) ·sin (5. 61 · d − 0. 224 ) 60 (A. 20) 60 Appendix A: Details of Previous Studies Equation A. 20 is valid for descending stairs with d &lt; 0. 92 m2/m2.&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A.

GHORFA STAIRS I saw a picture of the ghorfa stairs in a newspaper article. 1&quot;&#x27;9 38  They are exceptional, without any European orderliness.  Since my topic is &quot;People and Stairs,&quot; I wanted to know  how the people in Tunisia made do with these stairs. How was it possible? The ghorfas were fascinating in their  enormous irregularity. I wanted to see them. So I booked  atrip to south Tunisia. My traveling companion was  a neighbor, who assisted me in the travel and in taking  the measurements. We had quite an adventure. &quot;[INPUT: stair.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;NFPA101 (NFPA 2012a, b) currently does not automatically require the third stair (NFPA 101 7. 14. 1. 3). Three (or more) stairs may be required in relation to occupant loads and travel distance. There is therefore the need to evaluate the possibility of adopting in NFPA101 the prescription of a third means of escape, and discuss about the possible egress component(s) to be used, i. e. , either a third stair, the use of OEEs or sky-bridges.&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*.

<li>&quot;This article establishes a minimum stair width of 1200 mm (47 in) with stair treads of 240 mm (9. 5 in) or more and a rise of 200 mm (8 in) or less. Chapter V of the BSL Enforcement Order deals with Evacuation Facilities. Article 120 addresses through stairs provided for access and egress, and article 121 requires that at least two through stairs be provided.&quot;[Bukowski, Richard W. *Emergency Egress From Buildings*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Despite being described as a ‘good C17 stair’ by the list description, the staircase is atypical for a house of this age and status in having a fourth landing and upper flight supported over the stair well, blocking off all natural light to the ground floor of the stair hall (see Figure 5. 6). The owners wished to re-locate those details to re-create an open well staircase.&quot;[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*.

<li>&quot;34, para. 6, sent. 2 of the MBO specifies that stairs must be fitted with handrails on both sides and intermediate handrails where this is necessary for safety reasons. However, some federal state building regulations stipulate this for stairs in buildings with more than two dwellings reached via stairs. If stepless access (i. e. ramp or lift) to these dwellings is not possible, the use of the stairs by older occupants should be made safer and more comfortable by providing a handrail on both sides.&quot;[Heiss, Oliver *Barrier-Free Design*.
