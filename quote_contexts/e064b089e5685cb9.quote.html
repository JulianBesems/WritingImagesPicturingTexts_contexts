      <li>&quot; AICR[v. 20020404] Prn:23/02/2006; 11:23 F: DDCS708. tex / p. 4 (172)  Kirstie Edwards et al. Writing research has evolved from being focused primarily on the text in early models into gradually incorporating increasingly complex perspectives, with the writing process recognized as a social and communicative act. Partly, the concern in modeling writing appears to be identifying the influences on the process and partly, identifying the process itself.&quot;[Information And Document Design: Varieties on Recent Research (Document Design Companion Series), Information Design Conference, Saul Carliner, Jan Piet Verkens, Cathy De Waele, 2006]</li>
<li>&quot;These documents are published by IPA [7]. Here after, this paper describes the 11 job categories as shown in Table 1. 3. 1 Processing Outline The outline of the process is shown in Fig 2. The input of this process is eleven text documents. To be able to analyze these text documents, applying the following steps: Extraction Process.&quot;[Advanced Techniques for Knowledge Engineering and Innovative Applications: 16th International Conference, KES 2012, San Sebastian, Spain, September 10-12, 2012, Revised Selected Papers, Atsuko K.

<li>&quot;(Granville, 1989). All of these data has to be evaluated in order to select the sequence. Process planning requires many kinds of human abilities, which should be present in the process planner (Steudel, 1984). The traditional approach to solving the process planning task is the one commonly used in a manufacturing company: the plans are handed over to the manufacturing process experts who then specify the procedures to make the product.&quot;[Cooperative Design, Visualization, and Engineering: First International Conference, CDVE 2004, Palma de Mallorca, Spain, September 19-22, 2004.

<li>&quot;A Plan is defined as a &quot;process,&quot; and yet process is given no technical definition, either in their book or in subsequent planning research. Despite the broad and inconclusive connotations of &quot;any hierarchical process,&quot; in practice they use the word Plan much more specifically. In some places it refers to a &quot;TOTE unit,&quot; which is a simple kind of feedback loop, and in other places it refers to a parse tree of the type described formal language theory.&quot;[Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide, Geoffrey Bowker (Ed.), Susan Leigh Star (Ed.), Les Gasser (Ed.), William Turner (Ed.), 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;This can be a handmade process or an automated one. For this process several materials come together to form a new material (with borrowed properties from the materials it is built from). This is a critical process that demands a lot of planning as to ensure that the materials work in concert to form a larger assemblage (and not just clutter). The following picture serves as an illustration of this weaving together process (see Figure 49). As the integration process continues the materials blend into a composition that starts to form a new texture (see Figure 50).&quot;[Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies, Mikael Wiberg, 2010]</li>
<li>&quot;Users with roles Prosecutor and Assistant are assigned to execute the MLA process and activities that are part of the process are represented as tasks (see Figure 1). In this scenario, the task ”Translate Documents” T3 is originally only accessible by the user member of role Prosecutor, a fact deﬁned in the workﬂow policy. We deﬁne a workﬂow policy as a level of deﬁning access to task resources. We denote P an authorisation policy for the MLA process.&quot;[Advanced Information Systems Engineering: 22nd International Conference, CAiSE 2010, Hammamet, Tunisia, June 7-9, 2010.

<li>&quot;In our approach to create one such architectural register for interaction, and to start our work on the construction of a method and approach for generating one such semantics we set out to interlink architecture with interaction design through a cycle that start out in the borrowing of a set concepts from the field of architecture to discuss and address interactive architecture (see arrow 1 in Figure 82).&quot;[Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies, Mikael Wiberg, 2010]</li>

<li>&quot;The interpretation cycle is shown in Fig. 5. Each filled ellipse represents a sub-process within the interpretation process. If, for a given search action, the outcome of object recognition is such that the verification process detects an inconsistency, a message is passed to the search action generation process. This process then searches in the knowledge base for a segmentation method to solve the inconsistency.&quot;[Graphics Recognition Methods and Applications: First International Workshop University Park, PA, USA, August 10–11, 1995 Selected Papers, Lawrence O&#x27;Gorman (auth.), Rangachar Kasturi, Karl Tombre (eds.), 1996]</li>
<li>&quot;The method as proposed in this book is not a tool for addressing this gap. However, it juxtaposes perspectives from the fields of architecture and human-computer interaction. By borrowing a set concepts from the field of architecture to discuss and address interactive architecture, we can challenge a set of architecturally rooted concepts from an interaction design perspective in an attempt to refine concepts with roots in both the field of architecture, and in interaction design, i. e. an architectural register for interaction.&quot;[Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies, Mikael Wiberg, 2010]</li>
