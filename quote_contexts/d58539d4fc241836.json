{"created_at": 1762117434.115596, "confirmed": true, "origin": "suggested", "search_input": "The dominant computational model in architecture is currently that of the 3D CAD model, and in many practices especially that of the integrated BIM model. In turn these models mediate the other modes of architectural communication. They directly propagate plans, sections, renders and diagrams from which the idea of the architectural design is understood. In this form the 3D model can be seen as a universal model that connects all representations. This connection is defined by means of the Cartesian coordinate system through linear projection, dictated by the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Euclidean geometry as defined in Euclid\u2019s work Elements is presented as an abstraction of physical space, and as such was initially bound to 3 dimensions, as is currently the case in its use in the 3D model . Later this definition was broadened to include n-dimensions. The Cartesian coordinate system serves as an encoding of this space by being able to refer to specific points in space by means of a set of orthogonal coordinates, an alternative is for instance polar coordinates. The linear connection from 3D model to a plan, section or even render is calculated based on these orthogonal coordinates by projecting them onto a single plane. By connecting all models of communication, it could be argued that through the 3D model the architectural object has been internalised into the Cartesian system in its entirety. Singular, and with no abstraction, the architecture is internalised within computation. Further development in this direction is that of the digital twin, where the digital seeks to be identical to the physical manifestation of the architecture."}
