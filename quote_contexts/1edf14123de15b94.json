This framework is dynamic, as it is influenced by the user's actions, as well as the types of information being projected. The interactions between the domains also create a unique narrative, one that is constantly evolving and adapting to the user's needs. By examining the relationships between these domains, we can better understand how the writing can be used to facilitate the creation of new knowledge.", "suggest_context": "3.2 DOMAINS Domains in this context are the fields of information between which the projections take place, as well as those that establish said projections. In the architectural communication, domains could be understood as the ichnographic, orthographic and scenographic drawings. Here, given the focus on images and text, these will form the primary domains, with the third being a collection of documents that inherently contains both. The choice was made to have the interactions take place between two domains that can be seen as the generic, big enough to not be curated, and broad enough to be able to expose an exhaustive amount of information hosted by the writing. The projections between these two generics are however of a more precise nature, although we will explore the variety of scale within this as well."}
