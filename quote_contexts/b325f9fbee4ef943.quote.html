    <div class="selected">Architecture Architecture is not only essential as shelter for people, livestock, and crops but is the most public of all folklife expressions, revealing, to those able to “read” the cultural landscape, clues about the background of the builders and how they responded to a locale’s physical environment. 24 A folk building’s tradition is expressed in its design and construction, the design resulting not from plans by a school-trained architect but from the builder’s knowledge of an area’s architectural repertoire as evolved over many generations.[Burrison, John A. *Roots of a Region: Southern Folk Culture*.

      <li>&quot;Variations include the rustication (i. e. , clearly delineated separation) of stone joints and courses and the addition of sculptural details including an urn atop the structure, a traditional funerary accoutrement incorporated into several of de Pouilly&#x27;s designs. Along with the sarcophagus, the temple of Greek and Roman antiquity often served as an inspiration for tombs and mausoleums. De Pouilly explored numerous options of this type. The design he most often rendered was prostyle (a plan with columns that support a front portico) in which two doric columns supported a shallow porch.&quot;[Meyer, Richard *Cemeteries and Gravemarkers: Voices of American Culture*. Utah State University Press, 1992.]</li>
<li>&quot;The Gothic style seldom took this into account. It preferred tendentious  motifs for enlivening the structural parts; its pure ornament derived more from  craft concerns than from the plastic representation of functional-dynamic  effects. In contrast, the filling was usually either empty or filled with pointless Gabled houses in Rouen plankwork. But this reproach applies less to the early Gothic style (which was  still half Romanesque) than to the later style, to which almost all the timber  buildings in this style belong. 73 &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Usually a rich system of many such zones comprises a whole sequence of  beam layers between the stories, from window to window; it forms a broad  band around the building, interrupted only by gallery parapets of the same  height, which, though different, are decorated just as richly. Apparently a secondary intention here was to hide the wind shakes and  even the horizontal joints in the logs, or rather to neutralize them aesthetically. This is a principle contrary to the Gothic style. Some of the ornaments occurring here are simple notches that cumulatively resemble wickerwork. The Romanesque stone style obviously adopted  this motif from timber architecture. &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Then the development of ﬁreprooﬁng techniques came to support the external walls and the ﬂoors on the steel frame and in doing so, reduced the mass of the wall to what Alan Colquhoun provocatively calls “a thin cladding” (Modern Architecture, 37). See also William H. Jordy, “Masonry Block and Metal Skeleton. ” 4. Here we might think of the terraced and jewellike crown of the Chrysler Building, for instance, as a skyscraper that is simulating a woman’s gown. Architect William Van Alen’s original design for the Chrysler Building called for a decorative jewellike glass crown.&quot;[Cheng, Anne Anlin *Second Skin: Josephine Baker &amp; the Modern Surface*.

<li>&quot;What is now the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, built between 1871 and 1888 just west of the White House to house the departments of war, state, and the navy, was the epitome of architectural fashion, with its mansard roof and rich architectural ornamentation in the lush Second Empire style. 3 The Washington Monument would have no architectural ornamentation whatever, despite numerous plans and proposals to add some in the Gothic or Renaissance style. One plan sought to merge “modern French Renaissance” style with “some of the better Hindu pagodas. ”4 Another concern was whether the foundation as originally planned and built was adequate to support the 91,000-ton weight of the completed structure.&quot;[Gordon, John Steele, and George Washington *Washington&#x27;s monument : and the fascinating history of the obelisk*.

<li>&quot;These changes are connected to the lightness of symmetrical forms used in their delicate sculptures. All one sees are pilaster shafts decorated with trophies, candelabras, bandlets, cartouches, friezes covered with emblems, garlands, bucrania, rinceaux, tracery, and capitals carved with sculptures based on human figures. Hence the austere framework of the architecture of antiquity is made to smile and flowery Gothic style with its delicate stone tracery is, in fact, closer to Renaissance style than to Greco-Roman style.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*.

<li>&quot;Ultimately, with a jolt, one realizes that his description, composed in the luxuriant social milieu of Oscar Wilde and the 1880s, may be a set piece of art nouveau—a sort of ancient Pantheon and medieval Chartres transformed as if by some fantasy art-glass craftsman in Lalique’s atelier. Haggard includes in his description a literal floral design typical of the period’s enthusiasm for curvilinear leaves and flowers: “What makes the whole effect even more gorgeous is that a belt of a hundred and fifty feet around the marble wall of the temple is planted with an indigenous species of sunflower, which were at the time when we first saw them in a sheet of golden bloom. ”11 This is an organic architecture rooted in natural forms, with external forces such as the sun acting on internal patterns to produce a continuum of design that links earth to spirit as ornament, structure and metaphor.&quot;[Monsman, Gerald *H. Rider Haggard on the Imperial Frontier: The Political And Literary Contexts of His African Romances*. ELT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The historical tradition is not the least of the influences on the development of a style. Architecture (not forgetting furniture, which is a kind of auxiliary architecture) is, in fact, the traditional art form par excellence. Painting and sculpture find their inspiration, their subjects, all around them. Architecture, on the other hand, finds only raw materials: the clay of the sculptor or the palette of colours of the painter. Beyond man, architecture has no subject. It borrows from nature whenever it turns sculptor or painter to clothe limbs of stone, wood or metal with meaningful and decorative garments.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*.

<li>&quot;31. Sculpture The function of sculpture was twofold. It was first architectural. In most Maya buildings sculpture wss an integral part of the structure.

<li>&quot;Death has shaped architecture in many other ways too. For example, in his richly detailed monograph on the design and enduring influence of the Pantheon in Rome, William MacDonald is adamant that ‘Circularity in architecture derives in no small part from the tomb. ’ 4 The early stone circles, barrows, pyramids, round tombs and terraces all helped create the templates for many future architectural and monumental forms. Indeed, the revival of neo-Classical architecture Circularity in architecture derives from the tomb: the Mausoleum of Augustus in the Field of Mars, Rome.&quot;[Worpole, Ken *Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;Aristocrats would use its exuberance in design to flex their riches to visitors, bragging about their wealth and power with architecture, art, and interior design. Brass, gold, gilded surfaces, brocades, marble, and onyx are only some of the opulent materials used to define the language of Baroque design—quite the opposite of using a fibrous and recyclable material like cardboard. Because of this utilitarian quality of cardboard, Jillian’s pieces take on more meaning than simply beautifully constructed ornamentation.&quot;[Zimmer, Lori *The Art of Cardboard: Big Ideas for Creativity, Collaboration, Storytelling, and Reuse*. Rockport Publishers, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;The void between corporate architecture and vernacular architecture seems to have become almost unbridgeable. Furthermore, as Edwin Heathcote has argued, it was one of the intentions (conscious or otherwise) of a certain style of modern architecture to forswear any contact with the landscape, let alone the ground beneath: Modern architects, and more specifically functionalist architects sought to disassociate buildings from the earth. Pilotis, walls of seemingly frameless plate glass, were intended to lighten the building’s contact with the ground, to do away with the need for a cellar, the repository of repressed Freudian evils and the darkness below and to create an international style which was not bound to the earth but could quite easily sit anywhere. 6 One of the few critics who has attempted to elaborate the principles of the funerary landscape, a p l ace at t he en d of t h e e a rt h |  and the architecture within it, has been the anthropologist Louis-Vincent Thomas.&quot;[Worpole, Ken *Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;One of the styles that can be most clearly observed in the building’s design is Palladian in nature, drawing on the design themes present in the work of Italian architect Andrea Palladio (1508-80), notably the kind of symbolism seen in classical Greek architecture. A famous example of this can be seen in Somerset House, London (above), with the central part of the State House bearing the most obvious parallels with Palladian architecture. In addition, Bulﬁnch’s work evoked the neoclassical styles embodied by the likes of Scottish architect Robert Adam (1728-92), although in a move that evoked themes closer to home, wood was used for the columns in the colonnade, as well as for parts of the stairs and decorative bands on the columns.&quot;[(ed.), Sanne de Boer *How it works book of incredible history*. 7th ed.

<li>&quot;Form, function, and economy of material were rules of design during the Spanish Colonial period in Texas. Almost without exception all of the surviving decorated or artistic ironwork from this period carried essential functions. Knives, spurs, andirons, and door hardware were designed with their function in mind first; purely decorative elements were applied sparingly. To conserve material, iron was commonly decorated by simply being twisted or incised with chiseled decorations. The scroll became a common decorative motif applied by the Hispanic smith.&quot;[Abernethy, Francis Edward *Folk Art in Texas (Publications of the Texas Folklore Society)*.

<li>&quot;C. R. W. NEVINSON, Art Rebel Centre (London). FUTURIST ARCHITECTURE ANTONIO SANT ’ELIA 11 July 1914 Architecture has not existed since the year 700. A foolish motley of the most heterogenous elements of style, used only to mask the skeleton of the modern house, goes under the name of modern architecture. The new beauty of cement and iron is profaned by the superimposition of carnivalesque decorative encrustations that are justified neither by structural necessity nor by our tastes, encrustations that take their origins from Egyptian, Byzantine, or Indian antiquities, or from that stupefying efflorescence of idiocy and impotence that has taken the name of neo-classicism.&quot;[Poggi, Christine, Lawrence S. Rainey, and Laura Wittman *Futurism : an anthology*. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Curiously, de PouiUy and his New Orleans clients did not find the Medieval Revival styles very appealing. Mausoleum designs inspired by the middle ages did not become especially popular in New Orleans commemorative arts until the second half of the nineteenth century. However, the de Pouilly designed Caballero family tomb in St. Louis Cemetery II, 1860, is an ornate example of Gothic style (fig. 6. 11). As indicated in his sketchbook drawings, the family chose a Gothic over a Classical Revival design.&quot;[Meyer, Richard *Cemeteries and Gravemarkers: Voices of American Culture*.

<li>&quot;Thus, in ancient Egypt the earliest type is a simple structure of mud or wattle and daub with a wood-framed doorway. Later sun-dried and kiln-baked bricks formed the material for private buildings. In subterranean tombs the brickwork lining yielded to stone, the structure was trans- lated above ground, and putting one unit on top of another resulted in the stepped pyramid. Correspondingly, Greek temple porches first had wooden posts, which were later transformed into stone columns, while the main structure was first of sun-dried brick, later of limestone or marble.&quot;[Lowie, Robert Harry *An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology*.
