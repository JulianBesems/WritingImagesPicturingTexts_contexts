Selected: I edited the bookshelf one shelf at a time, just looking for the least favorite book on each shelf. I was able to identify a book on each shelf that was less appealing than any other book on that particular shelf. This made it easier for me. Taking all the books off all the shelves and sorting them would have been much more effort. I would have gotten more distracted. I may not have been willing to get rid of as many books. The books I get rid of get taken to my local bookstore. There, they have the chance of being read by someone who needs them and not held hostage on my shelf, hoarded for that day that may never come.[Johnson, Jennifer *A Little Book On Happiness*. 2017.]

10. "This ideal is elaborated in an eighteenth-century English poem titled “The Reading Glass”: There is a Book, and in that book a page, Which holds a lesson for each state and age; That proper lesson every man should read;— And one good Glass is all the help he’ll need:— To keep your thoughts no longer in suspense, Nature’s the Book; the Glass is Common Sense. In Nature’s horn-book, her mere criss-cross row, ’Tis the ﬁrst sentence, “Live for Use, not Show. ” Could Scholars read this, thro’ the Glass of Sense, What loads would vanish of impertinence!"[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*.

For some reflection caused by reactions to ELIZA see his Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1976). More information about Daniel Dennett’s notion of the “intentional stance” can be found in his book of the same title (Cambridge, Mass. : MIT Press, 1987). At this point I should also recommend what is probably the most mind-bending book on artificial intelligence ever written, Douglas Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (New York: Basic Books, 1979)."[Westerhoff, Jan *Twelve examples of illusion*.

12. "In the more than two centuries since the book was first published, it has been the constant object of scholarly interpretation and a continuous source of inspiration to inventive philosophers. To tell the whole story of the book's influence would be to write the history of philosophy since Kant, and that is beyond our intention here."[Immanuel Kant, Paul Guyer (Editor, Allen W.

13. "For some qualifications of Kullmann's (and Barnes') views see the review of Kullmann's book by J. Mansfeld, Bibliotheca Orientalis 38, 220-225. 8l 156 CHAPTER FOUR latter. Thus the Posterior Analytics is not to be read as an essay in scientific methodology, but rather as an attempt to characterize the notion of an axiomatized deductive science as a model of how teachers should present and impart knowledge. On the other hand, scholars like Le Blond and Owen have stressed the importance of the role which dialectic was made to play in Aristotle's theory of the discovery of the first principles of science. 82 They pointed out, moreover, that the so-called doxographical surveys by which Aristotle prefaced many of his philosophical discussions should also be viewed against this background."[Algra, Keimpe *Concepts of space in Greek thought*. Brill, 1995.]

14. "For me, it was the first well-written book whose instructions could be said with no doubt to be found in places that were not books. This may seem paradoxical, since the novel speaks of Aristotle, theology, and history, but it’s true. Even someone who has never read a single book before will like The Name of the Rose. It is written in a language learned elsewhere. And since that book was published, no egg yolk has been immune to this disease."[Baricco, Alessandro, and Stephen Sartarelli *The Barbarians: An Essay On the Mutation of Culture*.
