Reading in my hut one autumn evening, the sudden sound of a pomegranate cracking open riveted my attention. One night when I went out to drink water from the garden tap, I heard a long-haul truck barreling along a distant freeway, and another time, as steam rose around my dishwater, I felt the floor rumble with a passing train.</pre>

      <li>&quot;Reading in my hut one autumn evening, the sudden sound of a pomegranate cracking open riveted my attention. One night when I went out to drink water from the garden tap, I heard a long-haul truck barreling along a distant freeway, and another time, as steam rose around my dishwater, I felt the floor rumble with a passing train.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*.

<li>&quot;This joining was neither direct nor traditional, however. With the vertical window, the connections between inside and outside were naturalized in at least two ways: (1) by paralleling the form of the window with the upright posture of the viewer’s body, and (2) by instituting an inhabitable space in the thickness of the window wall, making an experiential threshold between street and room. 8 The horizontal window, on the contrary, instituted a virtual connection and a physical separation between landscape and interior; its thin glass plane served as a mechanism for framing the panorama of nature, rendering it artiﬁcial on and through the surface of the ribbon window.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;The name of the gateway is written above it: “Moment”. ’ Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 1883. trans.

<li>&quot;The total whiteness is an effacement, an obliteration—a neutral element, like a road leading to a place of rest.

<li>&quot;Salvaged windows are framed by sills sculpted with plaster. (Opposite) “I love closing my eyes, having the door and window open, and hearing the fountain outside,” Journey says.&quot;[Kotite, Erika *She sheds : a room of your own*. Cool Springs Press, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;In the Chicago frame buildings, the gradual increase in the size of the window challenged the traditional role of the wall with small openings. Though this increase in window size had been intended as a way of increasing the amount of light within the building, and therefore its rentable area, the proportional enlargement of the area of glass and in turn that of the window brought about a transformation of the wall itself, making the difference between the window and the wall ambiguous.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;. . If one can find stillness in the midst of the city turmoil, why should one then forego such an easily accessible spot and seek a more distant one?10 A typical Chinese gentleman kept at least some portion of his walled-in garden as wilderness and while he went into the streets as a civil servant by day, at night he returned to become a mountain recluse.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>

<li>&quot;Strange and Tom Cruise’s The Mummy. Of course our own listed house projects hold special moments and continue to give us experience to pass on.

<li>&quot;Only in a hut of one’s own can a person follow his or her own desires—a rigorous discipline, and one that the poet Gary Snyder calls the hardest of all, presupposing as it does self-knowledge while balancing free action and cultural taboo, knowing whether a desire is instinctive or the imprint of culture, or if personal, whether such desires are the product of thought, of contemplation, or of the unconscious. 18 Even if this hut is only one’s normal abode inhabited in a different way, here in a hut of one’s own, a person may find one’s very own self, the source of humanity’s song.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*.
