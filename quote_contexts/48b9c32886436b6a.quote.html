    <pre>This introduces a new kind of non-calculable. Where formal languages promise symbolic transparency at the cost of combinatorial tractability, and soft machines promise adaptability at the cost of explicit structure, contemporary models offer powerful pattern-recognition at the cost of interpretability. Their “knowledge” takes the form of distributed statistical structure, accessible only indirectly through prompts, projections and probes.</pre>

<li>&quot;A disambiguated for- mal language is required for the purposes of formalization, abstract represen- tation and mathematical analysis of the semantics of natural language, as we learned in practicing translations of English to predicate logic. Interpretation in mathematical models or translation to a formal language disambiguates natural language expressions, which is prerequisite for an account of rea- soning and inference in ordinary language use. Our choice of mathematical methods should be determined by the kind of phenomena we want to study: for some quantificational ambiguities predicate logic is suitable, but for opac- ity phenomena different mathematical methods may provide analytical tools suited to different kinds of opacity.&quot;[B.H., Partee, Meulen A.T., and Wall R.E. *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics*. 1990.]</li>
<li>&quot;Many-sorted languages represent only an inessential extension of the concept hitherto expounded, provided the sorts are given equal rights. Instead of a language L with k sorts of variables, we can consider a onesorted language L with additional unary predicate symbols P1 , . . . , Pk and the adoption of certain new axioms: ∃xPi x for i = 1, .&quot;[Rautenberg, Wolfgang *A Concise Introduction to Mathematical Logic*. 3rd.

<li>&quot;This property emerges from the formal architecture of the system and not from any particular linguistic or processing constraint. We call this property Indirectly Constrained Recursion (ICR), suggesting a new perspective on recursion in language. ICR is a formal structural constraint and not a linguistic or processing constraint.&quot;[Roeper, Tom, and Margaret Speas (eds.) *Recursion: Complexity in Cognition*. Springer International Publishing, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;There are two dangers in this approach. By adding more and more operators to cope with different examples the language becomes increasingly complicated. This criticism might be levelled at CTL* in [EH], Moreover by simply adding a new operator one cannot be sure that the new language is sufficiently expressive to capture all the interesting phenomena of a general transition system. Criteria, independent of program logics, are required.&quot;[(auth.), José Luis Balcázar, M. P. Chytil, and V.

<li>&quot;It distinguishes itself from similar systems by allowing recursion under representation-level λ-binders while permitting a natural style of programming which we believe scales to other logical frameworks. Sample programs include bracket abstraction, parallel reduction, and an evaluator for a simple language with ﬁrst-class continuations. 1 Introduction Higher-order abstract syntax refers to the technique of using a meta-language, or logical framework, to encode an object language in such a way that variables of the object language are represented by the variables of the logical framework.&quot;[(auth.), Thierry Coquand, and Paweł Urzyczyn (eds.) *Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications: 7th International Conference, TLCA 2005, Nara, Japan, April 21-23, 2005.

<li>&quot;In particular, the important problem of deciding whether a regular tree language is FO[&lt;]-deﬁnable remained open [33]. Based on the word language case, it is tempting to guess that an answer to this problem ought to be found using algebraic methods. In this paper, we introduce a new algebraic framework to handle tree languages.&quot;[de Luca, A., F. Mignosi, D. Perrin, and G.
