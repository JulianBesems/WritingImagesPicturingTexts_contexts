What is interesting in this particular case, is that the figurative playground does not present itself amongst the 20 top figurative contents relevant to conversations about playgrounds.

Another interesting conversation is that of night : caressed, intertwining, sensuous, velvety, nuzzling, sensual, stimulating, kiss, caress, seductive, intimacy, kissing, humidity, abstract, seductress, kissed, fingering, tonguing, seducing, seduced , in which case the connection is more obvious, where the visual indices build up a clear genre of intimite scene in which one might expect to be speaking of the night.
