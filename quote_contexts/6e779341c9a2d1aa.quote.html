    <div class="selected">It is the babble of painting. All art is erotic. The first ornament that came into being, the cross, had an erotic origin. The first work of art, the first artistic action of the first artist daubing on the wall, was in order to rid himself of his natural excesses. A horizontal line: the reclining woman.

<li>&quot;I believe that there are only two conceivable methods for achieving repose  and harmony in colors (as well as in spatial combinations). The first is based  upon the principle of regular distribution, the second upon subordination or  authority. According to the first method, the juxtaposition of many colors or formal  elements of equally intense effect produces a kind of luxuriant and flourishing monotony, in which the eye misses nothing, but neither does it find anything  special. This repose that results from very rapid vibration, this uniformity of richness, is actually the Oriental principle of ornamentation in forms and colors.  &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Very striking with young children is the charm of some single and perhaps small feature, as, e. g. , a pair of shoes with buckles, stockings with clocks, jacket with bright buttons, a hat with a feather, a bit of fur here or ribbon there, a sash with buckle. So, too, the first pocket, the first trousers, suspenders, long pants or dress, first watch, parasol, muff, gloves, ring, necklace, standing collar, perfumery, new ways of wearing the hair, the first belt, breastpin, veil – all these stand out in memory in the most vivid way, and have played an important rôle in the education of self-consciousness.&quot;[Johnson, Kim K.

<li>&quot;Instances of the first type of context include (a) part of the ritual preparations for the birth of the first people from the great white tree on page 38c, (b) as part of a community naming ritual following a ritual sweat bath on page 30a, (c) as part of the sacred mushroom ceremony (Figure 5) which immediately precedes the first Verbal Art in Mixtec Writing sunrise, and (d) as &quot;trumpet music&quot; in the ritual greetings for the Eastern 117 and Nadir &quot;deities&quot; on pages 18b (Figure 3) and 20b (Figure 1, right side), respectively. 17 The common element in these four contexts plus the &quot;musical building&quot; seen in Figure 6 at the first sunrise, is &quot;birth&quot; and the state which immediately precedes a birth (&quot;labor?&quot;[Boone, Elizabeth Hill, and Walter D.

<li>&quot;The twenty chapters of the first installment surveyed the dwelling —the  first of eleven building types —but the historical survey extended only to the  domestic architecture of Mesopotamia, Assyria-Chaldea, Media and Persia,  China, India, and Egypt. Several themes crucial to Semper’s later theory were  introduced, however. In the introduction he articulated for the first time the  four elementary motives underlying the making of architectural form: the  hearth (the embryo of social institutions), mounding, roofing, and walling. 19 In  his chapter on Assyria-Chaldea, he invoked the notion of the dressing (Beklei-  dung) and its importance to artistic development in antiquity. 20 &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;As Miles (1989: 93) notes, clothing symbolizes “Eve’s subjection to Adam; the first gender arrangements occurred simultaneously with the first clothing. ” This gender order is underpinned by violence. In the Adam and Eve story, the Fall brings eternal wrath onto the first Mother; in Penguin Island (France 1909) the first clothing provokes the first violence – a rape. 25 The Adam and Eve tale does not explicitly address questions of race, but the story of the Tower of Babel does, figuring language(s) as part of humankind’s alienation from each other and from God.&quot;[Barcan, Ruth *Nudity: A Cultural Anatomy*.

<li>&quot;“Between the first ‘happy thought’ and the latest protected invention there is a long series of inventive processes related and developed into higher and higher forms. ” If the first series showed the earliest stages of invention via “accidental discovery,” “mere observation and appreciation,” and “happy thought” (utilization of natural resources), the second series showed intentional design, experimentation (trying two or more ways), patents and monopolies, and cooperative invention. Each step in this invention process required great social skills. 49 Series 3: The Practice of Primitive Arts: The Life Figure Series Reused from previous fairs were also a series of life-sized single figures, which had originally been constructed for earlier expositions (table 7. 5).&quot;[KATZ, WENDY JEAN *The Trans-Mississippi and International Expositions of 1898–1899: Art, Anthropology, and Popular Culture at the Fin de Siècle*.

<li>&quot;The first meal after the funeral, which is prepared by friends and neighbors and consists of eggs and bread rolls—round objects that imply an endless circle, a reference to the continuity of life. Everything, from domestic arrangements to habits of the mourners emphasizes the fact that this is an intense period of grieving. First, mourners sit on low stools.&quot;[Murray, Sarah *Making An Exit: From The Magnificent To The Macabre*. Original retail. St. Martin’s Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Utilising a group’s dual appeal upon the eye and imagination, it was not difficult to increase or decrease the procession’s pace without On the northern frieze the calvacade forms and canters away at speed. But the first figures, stand quietly in lines, the very first in fact being a standing boy fastening his master’s belt (p. 175). In the background a rider is seen, and in front a dismounted horseman, whose figure preserves an echo of the lines from the last boys in the west frieze.&quot;[Von Mach, Edmund, and Parkstone Press *Greek Sculpture its Spirit and its Principles*.

<li>&quot;It was one of the first results of a period in Dürer’s life when, dissatisfied with his work to date, he set about systematically studying perspective, human proportion and the proportions of animals. Dürer was also one of the first artists to use watercolour, and has worked the optical effect of rendering the texture of the fur by establishing its colours with a broad brush and then building up several layers of detailed, fine brush-strokes. He was also the first to pay visual attention to the animal’s several distinct types of hair.&quot;[Carnell, Simon *Hare*. Reaktion Books, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;While a thorough discussion of modal music would be very complex, this explanation will help to understand more fully much of the repertory a fifer usually encounters. 12 Connecticut’s Fife and Drum Tradition The first tune, “Ginnie Pug,” or “Strawberries and Cream,” is composed of two regular phrases, the first of four bars, the second of eight. Both phrases are mostly in G minor. The first phrase uses the raised sixth scale degree associated with the Dorian mode (the E natural); the second uses the minor sixth of the Aeolian mode (the E flat).&quot;[Clark, James *Connecticut&#x27;s Fife and Drum Tradition (The Driftless Connecticut Series &amp; Garnet Books)*.

Plate 27. Big Boss, detail. Walnut, 1936. Plate 28. The design is drawn on the wood. Plate 29. Using the round side of the rasp. As I said before, some carvers discourage beginners in the use of the rasp, but to my mind it is the logical first tool. Surely the rasp, or its counterpart, a rough stone or abrasive, was the tool first used by primitive man in carving.&quot;[Rood, John *Sculpture in Wood*. University of Minnesota Press, 1950.]</li>
<li>&quot;We do know from Ponziglione’s writings that the grand chief is a direct descendant of First Man, or Sun. With this information we can examine several sets of Braden figures for what might be the chiefly symbols. There are several good examples of First Man figures to examine. The first and the oldest is the figure of First Man and his son Morning Star, the “Symbolic Man” at Picture Cave (Figure 7. 6; see also Figure 6. 4B).&quot;[Deter-Wolf, Aaron *Drawing with great needles : ancient tattoo traditions of North America*.

<li>&quot;The first table was a flat stone propped on other stones placed upright. The first seat was a block of stone. How could art make any headway in the face of such uncomfortable, makeshift arrangements?Yet, however rudimentary it might be, the colourful, primitive nature of the first home could be considered a kind of style. Let us enter the cave of primitive man and examine it. It is coarse, artless, has a flavour of savagery and is full of disturbing shadows. Animal skins and silex axes hang on the walls.&quot;[Bayard, Émile *The ABC of Style*. Parkstone International, 2012.]</li>

<li>&quot;6. and 7. Two different groups. The first could belong to any ES, because gold and silver are neutral colors, the second one&#x27;s color, red and whites, characterize the ES Salgueiro. 42 Monica Rector part in it. Starting with the First Republic, Carnival began to lose its characteristics, becoming largely a performance show. It is at this time that the name of Ze Pereira appeared. There is a controversy as to the date Ze Pereira appeared for the first time. &#x27;It might have been around 1852 that the Portuguese shoemaker Jose* Nogueira Paredes created or introduced the character Ζέ Pereira, that is, a small group of bomgos and drums.&quot;[Eco, Umberto, Vjačeslav V.

<li>&quot;This, at least, is what Viollet did when the 382 sentinel time came to build Millet’s Vercingétorix, which was the first colossal statue in embossed copper ever produced in modern times, and the first known copper statue attached to an iron structure in the history of architecture. It must have been comforting for Bartholdi to think that, if von Bandel had built the biggest statue in the modern world, Violletle-Duc had created the first colossal statue in iron and embossed copper.&quot;[Viano, Francesca Lidia *Sentinel: The Unlikely Origins of the Statue of Liberty*.

<li>&quot;Given a page containing many groups of sensations and analogies, with each group composed of, say, three or four lines, then the first line of each group might be formed of pictorial sensations and analogies (printed in heavier typeface) and the same sort of chain would continue (always in heavier typeface) in the first line of each of the other groups. The chain of musical sensations and analogies (second line), though less important than visual sensations and analogies (first line), yet more important than the olfactory sensations and analogies (third line), might be printed in a typeface lighter than that of the first line, but heavier than that of the third.&quot;[Poggi, Christine, Lawrence S.

<li>&quot;The first four hip convergences all coincided with watershed moments in the ad trade. Ads also traffic in the insubstantial aura around things, rather than the things themselves. Like hip, advertising shifts value among temporary repositories, abandoning the old ones simply because they are not new. The American Renaissance of the 1850s, the first hip convergence, followed close on the opening of the first advertising agency in 1841, and the rise of P. T. Barnum, huckster and trickster, who raised hype to an art form.&quot;[Leland, John *Hip: The History (P.S.)*. Harper Perennial, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;First he drew a face similar to the king’s, then he drew three more sketches, and said from the witness stand: The first looks like Louis-Philippe, the last looks like the first, yet this last one … is a pear!Where are you to draw the line?Would you condemn the first drawing?In that case you would have to condemn the last as well, since this resembles the first and thus the King, too!Can I help it if His Majesty’s face is like a pear?You would sentence a man to two years in jail because he created a pear which demonstrates a certain similarity with the king!&quot;[Navasky, Victor S. *The Art of Controversy: Political Cartoons and Their Enduring Power*.

<li>&quot;Similarly, as part of a Tsimshian First Salmon Ceremony to honour the return of this life-giving fish, they placed the first salmon to be caught on a newly made cedar bark mat and sprinkled it with eagle down — a symbol of friendship and welcome. Among some peoples, the First Salmon Ceremony ended by wrapping up all the salmon bones and uneaten parts in a cedar bark mat and putting it into the river.&quot;[Stewart, Hilary *Cedar : Tree of Life to the Northwest Coast Indians.*.
