It is no longer a matter of simply scaling up or down a geometric form, but rather of navigating the complex interplay between geometric, linguistic, and cultural scales. As architecture's digital ecology is rethought, the scale of architecture itself must be reimagined. It is here that the notion of 'scale' as a dimension of architectural thinking can be reinterpreted, moving beyond the traditional opposition between the 'big' and the 'small'. The scale of architecture is not merely a matter of size, but also of complexity, multiplicity, and the interplay between different modes of thinking and making. In this sense, the scale of architecture is not fixed, but rather a dynamic and relational construct that is continually negotiated and redefined through the practices of architecture.", "suggest_context": "1.1.2 SCALES OF ARCHITECTURE BEYOND GEOMETRY Does it ever occur to us that the language that architects read and write can itself be altered and rethought?... Might not the limits of the spatial notation currently in use impose limits on the architecture that architects are capable of creating? This reflection, posed by doubleNegatives Architecture after echoing Wittgensteins famous assertion that The limits of my language mean the limits of my world, forms the terrain of this section. The previous section described how the CADBIM and digital-twin regime elevates Cartesian geometry into the primary carrier of architectural information. If the limits of an architects digital language are shifting toward this geometrical centre, then we must ask what modes of architectural thinking are being excluded. This is not merely a philosophical worry; it is a practical and epistemic concern. Wittgensteins own trajectory is instructive. In the Tractatus, language is pictured as a logical mirror of the world: a proposition represents a possible state of affairs. The later Philosophical Investigations re-evaluates this picture in favour of language-games, where meaning is what words do in use, embedded in \"forms of life\". A BIM model belongs very clearly to the first stance: it is a picture of a building, articulated as a totality of facts. Architectural practice, however, behaves much more like Wittgensteins later language-games: drawings, models, texts, films and conversations do not simply mirror a building; they continuously renegotiate what it is, as it is designed, discussed, and inhabited. The question is thus not whether geometry is necessary, of course it is, but what happens when an entire digital ecology is organised as if architecture were only what can be pictured in this way. From its origins, architecture has demanded a synthetic intelligence; one that navigates and negotiates between modes of thinking, drawing, modelling, scripting, narrating. As we have seen in the work of Vitruvius, Alberti, Tschumi, Ando, Koolhaas and Ishigami, architecture arises through the tensions and resonances between different kinds of concerns, interests and domains of content. Studio practice relies on a navigation through abundance: models, drawings, texts and references linger, are re-seen and re-read over time. This multimodal capacity sustains architectures discursive and speculative scope. In the contemporary digital condition, this abundance is amplified by the global network Jorge Orozco Esquivel describes: information circulates ad infinitum and objects are characterized from many indexes rather than by single definitions. What are the consequences when the qualitative, the speculative, and the non-geometric dimensions of architecture lose their footing in computational discourse?"}
