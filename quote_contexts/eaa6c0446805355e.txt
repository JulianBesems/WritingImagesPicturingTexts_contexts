Selected: I mean an ongoing daily process; they think of a printed authority. Suddenly, in this gap, emerges a mental image of me, shrunk like Alice moving through a world of words.[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]

--- Context List ---
01. "It is not just a different place, but a place that no longer exists at all. Our primitive psyches were not wired for that knowledge. Where once existed a familiar home, favorite shop, or longtime office, a place whose microcosm of geography we could easily and comfortably navigate (it’s out the door, down the hall, on the left. . . ), now there is a void."[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America's Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]

02. "Entering these follies feels like entering an art gallery, where Thom Mayne’s idea of “daily life” also seems quaint and distant. But daily life is only part of what we, as spectators, leave at the door; we leave behind our selves as well."[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One's Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]

03. "The grave has no doorway through which one may come and go. And to find oneself trapped in an enclosed place with no doorway is to find oneself alive in one’s own grave."[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]

04. "The name of the gateway is written above it: “Moment”. ’ Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 1883. trans. Hollingdale) Informal Occupation of Doorways Like the old man in Borges’s story, and notwithstanding Mongolian superstitions, we all find ourselves at one time or another occupying a doorway, on the step between one place and another."[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]

05. "Our present responses to doorways seem like dim echoes of distant chords; we need to tune in to those echoes to understand the simple and the subtle ways that doorways punctuate our lives and orchestrate our experience."[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]

06. "What role does remembering “things my own way” have here?"[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]

07. "I mean an ongoing daily process; they think of a printed authority. Suddenly, in this gap, emerges a mental image of me, shrunk like Alice moving through a world of words."[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]

08. "Yet, like the factories of Philadelphia, they retain traces of glamor. For Stephen Barber, Broadway forms “a geographically linear graveyard” and provokes thoughts of cinema’s intimate relationship with death, decay and erasure. 115 Returning to Dimendberg’s terms, Lynch’s shots of Club Silencio’s baroque ceiling, red curtains and dusty downtown surroundings forge another branch of our “social memory bank,” in which the destruction of an entertainment culture formed around compact central precincts and collective experience can be deposited."[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]

09. "“The delicacy of the plaster adds a certain fragility to the whole organic, serpent-structure; like an unwound ribbon, it lies in folds. For me, it evokes temptation and mystery—a halfway point between intrigue and well-being, and I would like to preserve the secret that surrounds its walls."[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]

10. "At one point, the Man from Another Place tells him,“This is the waiting room,” suggesting a space of permanent transition, never to be settled. Soon enough, physical metamorphosis, duplication and injury abound; all matter is disrupted, as coﬀee switches from liquid to solid; lights ﬂash wildly."[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]

11. "The problem with X-ray vision is that it takes for granted, but cannot explain, the constitution of a spatial continuum. The territory between a foreground and a background ﬁgure is an element of both separation and connection, the place where one passes into or onto the next."[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]

12. "Not for our purposes. Because they exist inside our skulls, and that’s what counts. And only the least imaginative among us won’t feel them lurking in the shadows, just out of sight."[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America's Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]

13. "The total whiteness is an effacement, an obliteration—a neutral element, like a road leading to a place of rest. It is as if one were in a cavern, hidden away, a place where one rediscovers one’s origins and roots."[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]

14. "In societies like ours, where architecture and history make meaning out of vast and shifting complexities, the primitive hut is a search and an attempt to pare away what is given and apparent, to find something else to satisfy our deepest emotions."[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One's Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]

15. "modern building and historical memory History could be, and often is, seen as a phenomena of change, of epochs and associated styles succeeding one another in time."[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]
