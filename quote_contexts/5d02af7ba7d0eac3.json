Instead, digital models are treated here as a medium that can generate new architectural possibilities and relations, rather than simply reflecting or representing existing ones. This is not to say that digital models lack a connection to existing projects, but that their primary function is not to illustrate or document, but to create and facilitate the emergence of new architectural meanings. In this sense, digital models are not just a tool for architects, but a partner in the creative process, capable of influencing and shaping the design itself.", "suggest_context": "1.2 AMBITION But the arts of which we speak should, on the contrary, by means of numbers and relations of numbers, engender in us not a fable, but that hidden power which makes all fables. - Paul Valry, Dialogues The previous chapter 1.1 has outlined the challenge of facilitating architectural thought within the digital beyond geometrical encoding. The current geometry-forward digital 3D model is powerful, yet prone to monopolising architectural process by over-identifying architecture with its most readily computable register. The ambition here is to work from the opposite direction: to attend to the operations that make architectural communication relate across domains. What matters is not just what computation can represent and produce, but what information technologies can stage: how it can host the registers through which architecture persists as culture, atmosphere, discourse, and discipline. This thesis therefore explores how a manner of architectural thinking can be applied within the digital by cultivating an instrumented space of constant interaction, a sort of informational playground, where architectural processes remain active, and where modalities do not collapse into a single, sovereign axis. The aim is therefore not an other translation of architecture into data, but an architectural engagement with dominant digital modalities most insistently: text and image, treating their difference as a productive constraint rather than a gap to be aligned away.
