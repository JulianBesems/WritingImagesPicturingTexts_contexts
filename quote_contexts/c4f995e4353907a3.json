This approach to visual reading via navigation by writing allows for a collective reading experience, where the reader can navigate through the image lists and discover novel connections between the written and visual elements. In this way, the writing and images become intertwined, forming a rich and complex narrative that rewards close reading and exploration.", "suggest_context": "Figure 3.6:3 - Screenshot of 7 \"relevant word\" views of the image popup window. Figure 3.6:4 - Screenshot of the clicked word view on \"extracted\" of the image popup window, with the image labels that overlap with the query. Paragraph The second option is Paragraph. The signature is analogous: p rightarrow1 ptF rightarrow2 wfF rightarrow3 i The only difference being ptF instead of wtF: the writing is vectorised directly into the textual film space by fitting a TF-IDF matrix on the films subtitles and embedding p into that space with dimensionality corresponding to films. Because we do not differentiate words as inputs, we project ptF as a single vector onto the figurative domain; we then use all extracted regions from that activation as figurative sets for the image domain indexing regions by number. Each region marks a distinct figurative neighbourhood activated by the paragraph vector and yields its own image constellation.
