Selected: An Informational Instrument celebrates these contradictions without having an explicit a priori base unit. It opens a different perspective. What if the emphasis is not on measuring reality but on encoding and decoding it in many ways, by crafting different keys to access the world in many ways? What if it is about articulating faces and mixing libraries? It is a different game then. You are not looking for specific properties to measure, but are trying to develop a communication channel through which you can articulate profiles of different encodings. This is the search for the most general and abstract ingredients in a given situation. There is no base unit of a book. Yet, in a Plentiful Play books are profiling libraries from many perspectives simultaneously. A book becomes a constitutive part of a character of an alphabet that articulates its library—a symbolic void element — Interesting to relate to groups, rings, and bodies 9783035624052.pdf

05. "*The application of bridges to an object yields a partition spectrum, which serves as the basis for defining objects. The spectrum can be further refined until the satisfactory approximation of an object is reached. Only at this point can that which is actually distinguished be represented as a set.

06. "*The operative concepts of the mathematical lexicon trigger models that must count as “reduced,” but not because they would draw a poor representation of the phenomena they “model. ” Models don’t “represent” at all, rather they “realize. ” Mathematics is the inexhaustible source of a generosity from which such “reduced models” (that are capable of realizing particular phenomena) can draw.* [Buehlmann__Mathematics_and_Information_in_the_Philosophy_of_Michel_Serres.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QWPAXNP5?page=25&annotation=4K8VHMC4)"
