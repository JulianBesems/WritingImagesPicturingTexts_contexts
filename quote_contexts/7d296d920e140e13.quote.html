      <li>&quot;Light is one. It only appears multiple and diverse because of the intervention of darkness which lacks intrinsic reality. Without light there is pure nothingness. Yet according to another point of view, darkness is the state of in differentiation (at- &#x27;iima). Correspondingly, light is the principle of manifestation. There is a Hadith: &quot;I was a hidden treasure, and as I wished to be known, I created the world. &quot;Now I wish to offer an additional remark as to the definition of the symbol.

<li>&quot;The condition is exacerbated when the building’s windows are glazed in tinted glass. Light and colour God created the heavens and the Earth in the very beginning…(and) God said ‘Let there be light’ (Genesis 1:1, 3) We shall do well then to consider this potential and beautiful principle of light and its concomitant colours, for the more deeply we penetrate into its inner laws, the more would it present itself as a marvellous storehouse of power to vitalise, heal, reﬁne and delight mankind. Few realise that they are walled in by the limitations of the sense perceptions.&quot;[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Do stars have intellects and souls?Are they ranked in an order ascending to that which is closest to God?Such questions are more philosophic than religious, even though a philosophic interpretation may be related to or have its origin in a Koranic or Hadith text. We all know of the numerous verses about light and darkness in the Koran, especially the famous &quot;light verse&quot; (XXIV, 35), that lend themselves to philosophic interpretations: light as the physical manifestation of intellectual or supra-intellectual light, and the different parts of creation as an orderly mixture of light and darkness, an analogy of being and not being, that terminates in God as pure or unmixed light.&quot;[(Editor), Jonathan G. Katz *Architecture as Symbol and Self-Identity*. Aga Khan Award for Architecture, 1980.]</li>
<li>&quot;Therefore, if we bring light into a dark room, the darkness disappears, and inasmuch as a soul is filled with good, evil will disappear. ”23 In packing many large windows into walls, Shakers gave to their buildings a state of transparency that revealed the world inside and out. Beyond its spiritual implications, this remarkable increase in the traffic of light served a more rational aim of making things lucid, exposing every scrap of space and every human event to the scrutiny of vision and thought.&quot;[Plummer, Henry *Stillness and Light: The Silent Eloquence of Shaker Architecture*. Indiana University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;These items were daily necessities rather than exotic consumables, and as artificial substitutes for natural time, light, and self-image, they were all crucial in forming a new urban culture. Time was traditionally called guangyin, literally, the fleeting light and shadow produced by the movements of the sun and moon. 27 With the introduction of Western clocks, this traditional temporal concept based on the cosmic cycle was replaced with one determined by the mechanical rhythm; a clock that rang by itself signified a time severed from nature.&quot;[Liang, Samuel Y. *Mapping Modernity in Shanghai: Space, Gender, and Visual Culture in the Sojourners&#x27; City, 1853-98 (Asia&#x27;s Transformations)*. London ; New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;And it is only in such darkness that light begins to take on a figurative quality – the living light of the candle flame or, as at Klippan, the row of roof lights which forms a Way of Light between sacristry and altar. 3 This eloquent analysis is, in effect, a poetic description of the mechanism of adaptation.

<li>&quot;The limitation of domestic coal burning in British cities was not to be fully addressed until the Clean Air Act of 1959. Lavoisier’s eighteenth century claim that plants and animals required light in order to grow became the key scientiﬁc basis upon which the health beneﬁts of daylight were determined (Hesketh 1852; Lavoisier 1790). The simple metaphorical connection between light and dark and good and evil was readily adopted in the rhetoric of eminent scientists; “elements of uncleanliness and corruption which have a vested interest in darkness” (Brewster 1781).&quot;[Manfredi, Carlo *Addressing the Climate in Modern Age&#x27;s Construction History: Between Architecture and Building Services Engineering*. Springer International Publishing, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;Throughout the year the sun sends its glaring light during the long hours of the Middle Eastern day. Even in the dark nights of Mesopotamia, light sent by the moon’s brightness or even by the distant stars is sufficient for the creation of a sense of space, although one imbued with mystery. The natural response made by the Sumerians, therefore, was the development of an instinctive space conception tied to natural light—which led to the organisation of the inner court as a way of harnessing the light without the climatic disadvantage of heat gain.&quot;[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Each of the towers of the side chapels is lit differently; the main south-west tower is bathed in a northerly light and is thus lit constantly, whereas the light falling on the two small twin towers on the northern side, one turned to the east and the other to the west, varies with the movement of the sun. This means that the play of light and shadow on the stippled walls and on the altar stone changes during the course of the day. Through these permutations, light breathes life into the building and alters its appearance according to the time and the day.&quot;[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Incidentally, the sky is blue because small particles of dust and droplets of water scatter light in the same manner as the particles scatter and turn the Moon red when there is an eclipse. Light and human biology The ancients described our eyes as ‘the windows of the soul’. Our life processes are regulated by the light penetrating our eyes and getting through to the endocrine glands: the pineal, pituitary, thyroid, hypothalamus and adrenals.&quot;[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;But even under dullyovercast conditions the light has an incandescent quality, seemingly brighter than intuition would allow. Artificial light is not regarded as a merely functional night-time substitute for daylight and sunlight. From all viewpoints the interior is punctuated by hand-made, clear glass lamps, suspended from the vaults or spaced upon the walls. These are lit at most times, regardless of the quantity of natural light, and with their pin-point brightness, add a further dimension to the nature and meaning of the interior.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Light becomes less bright the farther it goes, which in this case means the higher it goes. The Western window, on the other hand, admits sunlight directly—a curtain being used to block it out when necessary—and the rays of light travel in a downward direction. In Japan, lighting devices for the home originally used to be placed on the floor because of the way light entered it, as described above. It is the same with garden illumination: instead of hanging lights from trees, the Japanese used stone lanterns placed on the ground.&quot;[Yagi, Koji *A Japanese Touch for Your Home*.

<li>&quot;ILLUMINATION Allowing light to enter is typically,  but not always, the window&#x27;s principal  function. Sunlight traces the hours of  the day across one of the churches  of Lalibela, Ethiopia, ca. 11th century. WINDOW PAGE 9 FILTRATION The window risks the entry of the  unwanted -  dust, sand, people, fire,  light, air, bugs, animals, prying eyes -   so it often needs to operate as a filter  as well as a source of light and air. A screened window in the tomb of  Sheikh Salim Chishti, built in 1851 in  Fatehpur Sikri, Uttar Pradesh, India,  permits light and air but little else to  enter the mausoleum. &quot;[INPUT: window.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The 9th century Sufi Sahl al-Tusturı̄89 refers to the creation of man by divine light and explains: When it [man] reached the veil of the Majesty (hijāb al-‘azama) it bowed in prostration before God. God created from its prostration (sajda) a mighty column (‘āmūd) like a crystal glass (zujāj) of light that is outwardly (zāhir) and inwardly (batı̄n) translucent. The unique verticality of man and his spiritual essence, derived from his close connection to God (in order to create Muhammad, God projected his own light), is, in the Sufi tradition, opposed to the existence of the human reality on earth.&quot;[Mekking, Aart J.J., and Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;The lattices of doors and windows which were ingeniously designed by the literati and craftsmen, gave full play to light and shadow, and enable fixed doors and windows to show different appearances. In the morning, the rising sun casts slanting rays of liglit on the lattice, so the lattice rods seem thicker and shadows longer. With less light allowed in, the room is obscured and presents a kind of quiet beauty. When the sun shines at a straight angle on the lattice at noon, the lattice designs are fully exhibited and the maximum amount of light is let in.&quot;[(auth.), Weidu Ma *Classical Chinese Doors &amp; Windows*. Springer Vienna, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Good lighting can create a warm atmosphere, highlight a beautiful object or transform the character of an interior by introducing areas of light and shadow. Bleak, overhead and bare light bulbs make a space seem unfriendly and unrelaxing, while a few table lamps or uplights can make a room seem soothing and welcoming. Light that’s too bright just dazzles and drains, and a dim, dark room is depressing. There are three different types of lighting: Renno Planner pages 23/6/05 2:13 PM Page 112 112—planning your perfect home renovation ■ Atmospheric—Ambient or atmospheric refers to a room’s overall lighting and the mood it creates.&quot;[May, Alex *Planning Your Perfect Home Renovation: Save time and money with this essential guide to fuss-free home improvements*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Although no buildings prior to the Qin dynasty have survived, we can imagine how simple they were. Huainanzi, on Mountains •• contains an illuminative depiction: &quot;When light comes from a crack, a corner is illuminated; when light comes from a window in the wall, the north wall is illuminated; when light comes from the door, all the room is illuminated. &quot;It further comments: &quot;With ten windows fully open, the room is not as bright as when a door is open. &quot;These remarks provide us with plenty of useful information.&quot;[(auth.), Weidu Ma *Classical Chinese Doors &amp; Windows*. Springer Vienna, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Well, when the competition took place in 1998, we weren’t yet aware of Diller &amp; Scofidio’s work (Figs. â•ƒ2 and 3). In developing our proposal, we were thinking foremost about light, and hoping to discover all its potential. We learned all about the relevance of melatonin, the relationship between our eyes, light, need for sleep and how we awaken being strongly linked to the quantity, the temperature and the color of light. For me, these discoveries were extraordinary because they connected the physiology of the body to sunlight.&quot;[Roesler, Sascha, and Madlen Kobi *The Urban Microclimate as Artifact: Towards an Architectural Theory of Thermal Diversity*.

<li>&quot;Emotion is awakened by what the eye sees. . . ” 13 Light emerges here as a fundamental means of expression. It is employed as a “material” and models the volumes, affirming the full solidity of the material used. The psychological potential of light is also exploited to the full, conveying joy, exaltation or tranquillity, inviting prayer or meditation. Light plays with the forms and initiates an interaction of these forms; it is truly the organising component within the “masterly, correct and magnificent play”.&quot;[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The divergence between the relatively simple terms required to specify artiﬁcial light as opposed to the more complex calculations required to predict adequate levels of natural light remain as stumbling blocks for designers today (Fig. 2). The fact that a loss had to be modiﬁed in cases of rights to light, stimulated the development of standard methods of measurement for daylight in Britain.&quot;[Manfredi, Carlo *Addressing the Climate in Modern Age&#x27;s Construction History: Between Architecture and Building Services Engineering*. Springer International Publishing, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;Medina was frequently described as the City of Light and the Prophet’s tomb as lighting up the world (figure 1). The ideas behind these images express Sufi notions that involve a cosmic relationship between heaven and earth, with heavenly domes, the revolving moon and stars, the cosmic pillar, rays of light, Mohammed as a column of light, and cities of light as the main components. 26 In fact, the SMA’s head imam, when he fulminated against the Wahhabi and Ahmadiyya blasphemy, continuously compared the Prophet with the moon and the sun in a variety of ways, and his successor-saints with the heavenly stars. 27 In effect, the WIM leader, as the latest in a series of Brelwi-venerated Sufi saints, was presented as the replacement of Mohammed on earth and the channel through which the latter’s light was radiated.&quot;[Mekking, Aart J.J., and Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;DAYLIGHTING: A BRIGHT IDEA Daylighting—using natural light from the sun to illuminate a room—lets us keep electric lights off during the day, saving energy and money. When we&#x27;re inside, exposure to natural light gives us an emotional and physical connection to what&#x27;s going on outside. Even if we&#x27;re absorbed in an 58 good green HOMES &quot; &#x27;:• * _ Left and opposite: Tall windows illuminate a stairwell, while the skylight on the opposite wall balances the daylight levels.&quot;[Roberts, Jennifer *Good Green Homes*. Gibbs Smith, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Valued for its transparency over all other characteristics, glass released architecture from its fundamental deﬁnition of shelter as a secure, and likely dark, enclosure to one that allowed light to enter. No material seems to capture more contrasting qualities: glass can appear as two surfaces or none, and it can be transparent or translucent, visible or invisible, and enclosing or releasing, with varying degrees of reﬂection, refraction and transmission of light.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Light equals heat. Architectural historian Pevsner (1960, p. 381) explains: … in the Gesu … certain important features are introduced into the composition exclusively to make light effects possible. The nave is lit from windows above the chapels – an even subdued light … the last bay before the dome is shorter, less open and darker than the others. This contraction in space and lightness prepares for the majestic crossing with its mighty cupola … ﬂoods of light streaming down from the windows of the drum.&quot;[Short, C. Alan *The Recovery of Natural Environments in Architecture: Air, Comfort and Climate*. Routledge, 2017.]</li>
