The instrument is designed to keep a personal and intentionally biased stance operative. Against generic public screens, we work with authored private casts that tune what appears. In practice a curated set of books configures the textual context for a section, and a hand-picked corpus of multi-modal documents (films or pdfs) biases both textual and figurative indices. Public is generic, private is authored: projection becomes proportion, not translation. This bias is not a flaw but the architectonic move: a way to keep difference productive and yet legible.", "suggested_query": "Within WIPTe, the boundaries between text and image blur, as the editor's prompts and suggestions evolve into a dialogue that mirrors the author's own thought process. The constant flux of the writing environment shapes the narrative, allowing the reader to witness the emergence of new ideas and the refinement of existing ones. In this way, the WIPTe editor becomes an active participant in the creative process, rather than simply a passive tool.", "suggest_context": "3. TEXT EDITOR Companions: Chapters 1 and 2 asked how to work across modalities without forcing them into sameness, and how architectural thought might address non-geometrical registers inside digital encodings. Chapter 3 turns that demand into practice by introducing the Writing Images and Picturing Texts editor WIPTe. Not as a tool added after the fact, but as the very medium of this thesis. Every page you read in this document was written inside the editor. The redmagenta quotations and the blue images you encounter throughout the thesis are the instrument's replies to the act of writing, sometimes embraced as ornament to the content of the thesis, sometimes they become the content themselves. The editor frames writing as a constant movement: from text onto itself, and from text onto imagery."}
