<li>&quot;These essays articulate a quite radical agenda for the rethinking of the basic precepts of the construction industry in light of digital technologies and they are relentless in allowing the logic of digital systems to come to the fore. The collection will have relevance to architects, academics, architectural students and also to practitioners in many related creative ﬁelds who are similarly engaged in trying to comprehend the disciplinary signiﬁcance of the import of digital media.&quot;[Goulthorpe, Mark *The Possibility of (an) Architecture: Selected Essays by Mark Goulthorpe dECOi*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;For this will only come about through a marked shift in creative manner, and a thorough recalibration of notions of cultural reception. dECOi looks to attain a new intensity of architecture, sufﬁcient, as it were, to a 77 technological latency understanding of such changed socius4, and what ‘new’ (or not) cultural appe- 78 technological latency newly digital imagination, which operates (we venture) according to a very different conceptual register than that of pre-digital cognition. Our goal is to begin to articulate a legitimate model of digital praxis, which develops as a fully creative, as well as productive enterprise, through a reﬂection on the changed condition wrought by ‘the digital’ in a broad sense.&quot;[Goulthorpe, Mark *The Possibility of (an) Architecture: Selected Essays by Mark Goulthorpe dECOi*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Cai &amp; Abascal (2006); Margolis &amp; Robinson (2007) and Greenfield, 2006). Further on, this book builds upon a conceptualized understanding of the integration of architecture and digital technologies as ”Media spaces” to address how digital technologies enable us to spatially stretch places, connect places, and connect to other human beings across geographical distances (e. g. Morley, 1995), integration of architecture and digital technologies as new media and the digital transformation of public places (Drucker &amp; Gumpert, 1996), and the creation of so called “Media districts” (Indergaard, 2004).&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

<li>&quot;4 — barroom, sipping, restaurateur, tequila, mirror If there is a claim to carry forward, it is simple and demanding: keep architecture in the loop of digital work. Let architectural thinking, its sense for proportion, casting, sectioning, montage, index, and room, shape how corpora, models, and interfaces are assembled and used. The future directions suggested by the experiments follow from this claim: enlarge the repertoire and nature of digital casts; refine algebraic correspondences across media; articulate new scales of near and far in embedding spaces; and continue to design instruments that foster an architectural literacy within the digital, just as a digital literacy within architecture. &quot;[INPUT: WritingImagesPicturingText_JBesems_Small300dpi.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The works manifest a post-digital thinking by incorporating the indistinctiveness between digital and analogue into organic materialities and sensory experiences. The interplay between digital, biological, cultural, and technological elements, between conceptual and real space, between embodied and virtual media are manifestedly post-digital. In this sense, the approach that these works practice makes a clear statement in the debates surrounding the post-digital experience. They demonstrate that the trajectory of digital thinking is continued through crossbreeding with analogue.&quot;[Jecu, Marta *Architecture and the Virtual*. Intellect Ltd, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;© 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. 14 The Digital Turn in Architecture 1992–2012 Architecture After the Age of Printing (1992) Peter Eisenman These two essays by Peter Eisenman inaugurate digital discourse in architecture in the 1990s, and highlight the continuity between Deconstructivism and the first age of digital design. The contrast between the photograph and the telefax, cited in both essays, refers less to image-making than to the different nature of mechanical and digital reproducibility: unlike mechanical copies, which once printed are fixed and stable, digital images derive from number-based notations, or files, that can morph and change all the time.&quot;[Carpo, Mario *The digital turn in architecture 1990-2010*.

<li>&quot;The Digital Divide (or lack thereof) The use of pictures to analyze architectural proposals is an increasingly prevalent phenomenon. In the digital age, vision may no longer be “the keenest of all senses,” but it is certainly the dominant one. Both the venue of the screen and the perspectival biases of digital modeling programs have nurtured a culture of looking at architecture during the design process. Digital tools of pictorialization reduce (or even eliminate) a productive form of resistance that once characterized analog tools of pictorialization.&quot;[Forget, Thomas *The Construction of Drawings and Movies: Models for  Architectural Design and Analysis*. Routledge, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Also at Malen’s urging, I edited a special issue of the Art Journal focused on digital media and the arts. Encounters fostered by a series of Digital Arts Conferences, connections to the Electronic Poetry Organization, and involvement with various exhibitions and works broadened my reference base in this area. Though inspired by works of individual artists, my interest soon shifted to an investigation of the design conceptions that model digital art and humanities. I studied graphesis, code storage, the generative materiality of digital media, the ontology of digital artifacts, and the speciﬁc characteristics of new media.&quot;[Drucker, Johanna *SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Chapter 18 Multimodal Digital Humanities Kay L. O’Halloran 18. 1 Introduction Interactive digital technologies with facilities for developing conceptual frameworks and storing multidimensional data at different levels of description have the potential to advance research in semiotics (i. e. , the study of sign systems and processes). Such an approach, called multimodal digital semiotics (O’Halloran et al.&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*. Springer Netherlands, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;This apparent decoupling is an ominous sign, as design theory used to be at the forefront of digital innovation: in the 1990s architects and architectural theoreticians were pioneers of the digital frontier – which is probably one reason why end-of-millennium digitally inspired architecture was so eminently and almost universally successful. The best digital architecture of that time was not only inspired by digital technologies – it was a source of technological and aesthetic education for all.&quot;[Carpo, Mario *The digital turn in architecture 1990-2010*. Chichester: Wiley, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;The shift to a digital semiosphere has profound consequences for semiotic research, particularly with respect to moving beyond categorical distinctions inherent in language descriptions to dynamic and interactive topological views of semiotic systems and semiotic processes. The research 18 Multimodal Digital Humanities 413 paradigm involves interdisciplinary collaboration between social scientists and scientists, at least until semioticians are equipped with the necessary computational skills to design and build their own interactive digital technologies.&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*. Springer Netherlands, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;One reason is the ﻿Prefacevii still polarized nature of the debate on digital technologies between detractors and devotees. Both being equally ineffective, albeit in different ways, these factions suffer from the common tendency of approaching the role of digital tools in design too narrowly and, consequently, conjure up “premature metaphysics” of computation (Varenne 2013, p. 97). The former group stubbornly resists acknowledging that digital tools can be used generatively and therefore struggle to grasp the wider, often not even spatial, issues at stake when designing with computers.&quot;[Bottazzi, Roberto *Digital Architecture Beyond Computers: Fragments of a Cultural History of Computational Design*. Hardcover. Bloomsbury Visual Arts, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;I am simply recognizing two modes of projection that, despite their apparent demise as paradigms of knowledge, continue to inform the ways in which built environments are depicted. The perspectival bias of digital imaging will likely persist into the foreseeable future, and time-based modes of digital imaging are likely to become more prominent as the technology that generates it becomes ubiquitous. Even when digital imagery does not adhere to conventional understandings of drawing and cinema, it is still indebted to the construction logics of the former paradigms.&quot;[Forget, Thomas *The Construction of Drawings and Movies: Models for  Architectural Design and Analysis*. Routledge, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;X-rays: Apprehending the invisible The examples we have analyzed so far fundamentally understood voxels as small, often cubical geometrical elements. However, the mathematical, and consequently digital, definition of voxels far exceeds that of mere geometrical entities to incorporate additional properties, including material ones. These additional properties are in many ways the most original contribution of voxels to the definition and representation of space which digital designers and architects 194﻿Digital Architecture Beyond Computers have somehow often adopted without fully grasping its theoretical implications.&quot;[Bottazzi, Roberto *Digital Architecture Beyond Computers: Fragments of a Cultural History of Computational Design*. Hardcover. Bloomsbury Visual Arts, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;What separates digital media and practices of digital archiving radically from the spatial organization of the conventional archive (embodied as physical repository) is the socalled time criticality of digital media, the inescapable temporality that accounts for observations, such as Duranti’s (2010), about the errant ontology of digital documents. Indeed, though the chronological scope of the Larsen Collection is easily circumscribed, it resists our instinct toward a linear temporal trajectory. On one hand, the avant-garde nature of the material is such that traditional procedures of appraisal, arrangement and description, and access must be challenged and sometimes even overruled.&quot;[Hayles, N. Katherine, and Jessica Pressman *Comparative textual media : transforming the humanities in the postprint era*. Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, metadata assigns a context to the image through language, offering a mode of interpretation that, however limited, establishes a sense of meaning in the photograph, beyond that of an abstract digital code. The unstable position occupied by the digital photograph raises questions about the reliability of interpretation in the digital realm, an issue that is addressed by Seth Price’s Gold Key.

<li>&quot;First, these interactive textiles are beautiful, just like the numerical textures in the following pictures, but secondly also due to the fact that when it comes to interactive textiles the designers have actually managed to perfectly integrate digital and non-digital materials into compositions that form textures that communicate unification beyond the simple raw materials. As such, these interactive textures also serve as an important proof-of-concept for how alignments can be made across digital and non-digital materials.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

DIGITA A L A RT T F OR R MED DIA A FA AÇAD D ES S Digital art has existed since the 1960s; media façades, on the other hand, are much older – albeit they were not yet named as such in the beginning of the 20th century.&quot;[(auth.), Bruno Schindler, and Christoph Kronhagel (eds.) *Mediatecture: The Design of Medially Augmented Spaces*.

<li>&quot;I am suggesting an interdisciplinary approach to questioning and learning that incorporates an art research methodology. Research is the praxis of systematic critical reflection that focuses on compelling questions. And these questions can only be investigated when we unsettle the very tools we use to examine them. Since all acts of digitization are acts of remediation, understanding the identity of binary code, digital files, the migration of analogue materials and the character of born-digital materials is essential to understanding digital environments.&quot;[Downey, Anthony *Dissonant Archives: Contemporary Visual Culture and Contested Narratives in the Middle East*. I.B.Tauris, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;All these material and contingent properties and peculiarities indicate the importance of tags, as devices or tools, and as metaphors for ubiquitous digital media. As argued in the previous chapter, rather than emulating human cognition the tag is an adjunct to thought processes and is instrumental in moves to adjust the environment by small-scale temporal interventions. The way designers think about tags can reﬂect back and inform their views of the technologies that perpetuate them: smart phones, digital cameras, websites, the panoply of ubiquitous digital media.&quot;[Coyne, Richard *The Tuning of Place: Sociable Spaces and Pervasive Digital Media*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Networked conditions of exchange play another role in the development of digital humanities (and other digital) projects. Standards and practices established by communities form another crucial component of the technical infrastructure that embodies cultural values. Common myths about the digital environment are that it is stable, even archival ([e. g. ]permanent) and that it is ‘immaterial’ ([e. g. ]not instantiated in analogue reality). Every actual engagement with digital technology demonstrates the opposite.&quot;[Downey, Anthony *Dissonant Archives: Contemporary Visual Culture and Contested Narratives in the Middle East*. I.B.Tauris, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;On the other hand, post-digital is also a temporal determination, refering to the natural continuation of the trajectory of digital art. Associated to it were different strategies of understanding the object beyond the digital illusionistic composition, for example by the rejection of 154 Postdigital and the virtual: A question of density Fig. 4. 4: Sinta Werner, 4xDoublefixed / Classic Aluminium, 2009, Kunstverein Aichach, ©Sinta Werner.
