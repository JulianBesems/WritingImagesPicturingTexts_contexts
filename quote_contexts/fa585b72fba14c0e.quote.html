    <pre>4.1.1 FLOOR

<em>The floor was a dull grey, with a faint sheen that seemed to absorb the light around it. It was as if the floor was a sponge, soaking up every ray of illumination that dared to touch it.

As I approached, I could feel the air grow thick and heavy, as if the very atmosphere itself was being pulled down towards the floor.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;PAGE 28 FLOOR The apparently solid floor (designed by Kingspan) becomes a secret cavity for hiding the building&#x27;s support  systems, mostly wiring.
