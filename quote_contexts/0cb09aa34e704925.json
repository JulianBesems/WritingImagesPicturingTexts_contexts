The ornamental is a process of accretion, as the surface is gradually transformed through the addition of various elements. In digital ornamentation, this process is further complicated by the interplay of code and image, as the ornamentation is rendered and re-rendered through successive iterations of algorithmic transformation.", "suggest_context": "In discussing the character of ornament, and to then suggest an operative sense of digital ornament, I begin from the surface, as both the primary substrate or even condition for ornamentation. Ornament embellishes; it is what meets the eye: pattern, colour, relief. Therefore, at first it presents at surface-level."}
