      <li>&quot;*Just as we speak of repression in the limited sense when I retain through time one of the momentary worlds through which I have lived, and make it the formative element of my whole life—so it can be said that my organism, as a prepersonal cleaving to the general form of the world, as an anonymous and general existence, plays, beneath my personal life, the part of an inborn complex.* [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=122&amp;annotation=MXQU3N87)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Be­hind every profanation stands, therefore, the risk of privatization, a subtraction (privatio) from the public domain, and its reorientation towards the singular interests of enclosed domains—where the world image turns into ideologies and worldviews, and speech into closed-off specialistic languages.* [Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7EH52CZI?page=51&amp;annotation=WSWLYXI7)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*What allows it to be shared are the commonalities that exist in the way our minds are embodied* — **Interesting, as it is these commonalities that I aim to connect. In order to convey new insights for reason, instead of predetermining the logical interpretation by reason.** [Lakoff - Philosophy In The Flesh.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y77BL3YI?page=15&amp;annotation=ZRMT9IB2)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*A picture is said to be worth a thousand words because of its ability to hold as much meaning in one frame as can only otherwise be expressed in that many words. However, the ‘thousand words’ do not always remain the same for a single image. Depending on the audience and the context in which the image is being viewed, the interpretations can be different. Further, through a matrix of editing, captioning, and juxtaposing, the image can be made to ‘mean’ a thousand different words for particular audiences. Central to the ethics of representation, then, is the understanding that all photos and films are made not ‘taken,’ and their meanings are temporally and culturally contingent constructions* — **relevant for phd** [Roberts et al. - 2022 - Practising ethics guides for built environment re.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ER55CBY5?page=677&amp;annotation=I6I7A5W5)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Magr itte secretly mines a space he seems to maintain in the old arrangement. But he excavates it with words: And the old pyramid of per­ spective is no more than a molehill about to cave in.* [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=49&amp;annotation=BJGVNQTB)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*From knowing as activity we were led to knowledge, from positive knowledge, we return to perceptive activity, as if the communication (of substances)-expression (representation)signification-object (phenomenon)-essence cycle was indifferently plunged into the order of the subjective or that of the objectifiable; or as if the domain where the subject is active and passive was a cycle of representations in the same way as the domain where objects express themselves to each other, that is to say are significant, and are.* [01a. en (gpt)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR3KDWYV?page=40&amp;annotation=3NZIJG5L)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*other because the objects—the straight lines of Müller-Lyer—are not, in that field, assigned to the realm of being, in which a comparison would be possible, but each is taken in its private context as if it did not belong to the same universe as the other* [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=32&amp;annotation=3IHQ226B)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The finer the level of detail, down to the domain of individual molecules and beyond, the more the effects of their interplay are hidden from us. We will have to devise virtual codes that we can use to generate order. We have arrived at a crisis in our intuitive ability to view the world.* [Hovestadt and Danaher - 2010 - Jenseits des Rasters - Architektur und Information.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67RMUG96?page=12&amp;annotation=JY6HA7Q3)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*e idea that pure philosophical reflection can plumb the depths of human understanding is an illusion.* [Lakoff - Philosophy In The Flesh.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y77BL3YI?page=22&amp;annotation=JLNH9N57)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*One can admit, as a first approximation, that a punctual multiplicity represents the simplest model of such pluralism, generalized to the entirety of philosophical questions.* — **relevant to the multiplicity of an architectonic sculpture** [03.b. en (gpt) _ deuxiÃ¨me chapitre_ troisiÃ¨me partie [Serres, Michael_Le systÃ¨me de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9G4QDC2Y?page=4&amp;annotation=4THWGXSS)&quot;</li>
