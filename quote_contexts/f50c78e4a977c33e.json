Given that the entire work is written within it\u2019s own text-editor, made to use AI, I hope it is not a big surprise to say that much of this work is written in conjunction with various AI tools. And yes chatGPT was used as well, however not in the co-writing format that the other tools have been used. This is also immediately a way to say that in the work you will constantly find ways to contextualise what is presented, almost like a digital foldout page. This is immediately another comment on the world of chatGPT where these contextualisations are not immediately present, yes now there are links, (sometimes), but these show where the rephrased context comes from. Instead here the context is not a justification of what is there, it just shows the environment from which it was chosen and observed. For an architectural gesture this feels more natural, and also fits within the advocacy of multiplicity projection instead of translation which forms a major thread in this thesis. For your information, throughout the text the colour RED and its friends all denote the text domain, and BLUE and its friends denote the image domain. Most importantly red quotes are quotes that were kept from suggestions based on content, magenta quotes from suggestions based on a generated text continuation (one that we never see itself - the reverse of GPT). Similarly BLUE are image based on content, CYAN are images based on prediction."}
