In tragic history plays and epics, at the point of climax,  characters must keel over or fall over backwards onto the floor. Over and over in Homer&#x27;s  Odyssey, the &quot;floors are running with blood. &quot; While kneeling and bowing are common liturgical  postures, the fully prostrate body on the floor of a giant cathedral is a stirring, ultimate signal of  submission or humility.

In such cases, the deck is called a subfloor. When a floor is not placed directly on the ground; for example, when a floor extends above a room below, some means must be provided for supporting the deck in place.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

The space with a European style shown above is mainly used as a study room.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*. Design Media Publishing Ltd, 2011.]</li>

Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor. The walls pull from the white in the floor—a quiet “plane” in contrast with the “pop” of the painted floors.&quot;[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy &amp; broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*.
