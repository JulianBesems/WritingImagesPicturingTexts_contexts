Selected: There is pattern. It has coherence. And even as a generalisation, it makes sense. Summerson’s introductory remarks have always struck me as one of the more important aspects of his book. London was no longer an amorphous conglomeration spreading across the landscape, lost to its own history and to comprehension. Instead, one could read into it a patterning which — whether it was essentially true of not — helped one to understand what was going on, how the new intruded upon the old, what existed accommodated itself to change, and how that aged fabric once enjoyed layered horizons of relevance, one upon the other and all of it awaiting disentanglement on one’s own terms.[Allinson, Kenneth *London's Contemporary Architecture, Fourth Edition: An Explorer's Guide*. 4th ed.

01. "Nothing less seemed adequate to a nation in mourning over his assassination. People are drawn to the gravesite for many reasons, and once there, their 2. Fire 33 eyes focus on the ﬂame. The orienting power of ﬁre is inescapable. We are drawn to it because, like Prometheus, we appreciate its performative and transformative capabilities. Fire used inventively forms matter."[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]

02. "It is so very obvious!You would probably not feel it, but for me, who has experienced it a long time, I know that is what it is … it is more [their] astonishment that I know things and am able to do things that I am not expected to know or to do. 140 R. Sandberg et al. Mona becomes very animated as she speaks of these experiences; obviously the recollection still causes frustration, and as we perceived it, hurt pride."[Sage, Daniel J., and Chloé Vitry *Societies under Construction*. Springer International Publishing;Palgrave Macmillan, 2018.]

03. "Edinburgh would display Montrose’s head; Glasgow would get one of his off-Â�cuts. Montrose’s remarkable poem “On Himself, upon Hearing What Was His Sentence” recÂ�ords eloquently in its meaÂ� sured lines a determined commitment in the face of execution (the Scots word “airth” means “part”): Let them bestow on ev’ry Airth a Limb; Open all my Veins, that I may swim To Thee my Saviour, in that Crimson Lake; 174 · â•‡ medicine, museums, bloodâ•‡ · Then place my purboil’d Head upon a Stake; Scatter my Ashes, throw them in the Air: Lord (since Thou know’st where all these Atoms are) I’m hopeful, once Thou’lt recollect my Dust, And conÂ�fiÂ�dent Thou’lt raise me with the Just."[Crawford, Robert *On Glasgow and Edinburgh*. Belknap Press, 2013.]

04. "They had repackaged tradition as if for a trip to the big city. I once used this story to illustrate a larger point—that to gain perspective on life, Tea and activities like it use the world itself in order to abandon the world. I asked my students how much of their lives they spent in what has been called “confections. ” How much did media-driven experiences divert them from themselves and how much did these divertissements and spectacles cover over the most basic human aspiration—to know what it is to have a human life, as opposed to, say, the life of a dog or a cat."[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One's Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]

05. "Reading in my hut one autumn evening, the sudden sound of a pomegranate cracking open riveted my attention. One night when I went out to drink water from the garden tap, I heard a long-haul truck barreling along a distant freeway, and another time, as steam rose around my dishwater, I felt the floor rumble with a passing train. These moments of immediacy made me shiver."[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One's Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]

06. "Luckily for me, at the end they seemed to understand well enough the gist of my conclusion. Mr. Wright relinquished me to his adversary with the words "Your witness!"Mr. Crowley started my crossexamination. I was totally unprepared for what was to follow and 248 WHY BUILDINGS FALL DOWN can present my dialogue with Mr. Crowley only in the form of a script for a play or a movie, not as a verbatim account but as the recollections of a memorable, even traumatic experience: MR. C (sarcastically): My, oh, my!"[Levy, Matthys, and Mario Salvadori *Why buildings fall down: how structures fail*. W.W. Norton, 1992.]

07. "When the text refers to other sides, picture them as if you were standing in front of the door, looking at the bunker. The text above the door reads Door die which is Dutch and translates into English as Through thatwhat it refers to, or what word is missing, is anyones guess, but as this bunker has long been used as a playground by local children (including the present author 15+ years ago), it could be just about anything."[J., Westerbeke *Second World War. German bunkers*. 2017.]

08. ""* ŧ m. I had thought that, by this time, we had done with that stale, second-hand, one-sided, and misunderstood saying of Kaffaellc9s; or that at least, in these days of purer Christian light, men might have begun to get some insight into the meaning of it: Raffaelle was a painter of humanity, and assuredly there is something the matter with humanity, a few dovrebbe\ more or less, wanting in it."[Ruskin, John *The Stones of Venice: The foundations*. Smith, Elder, and co., 2013.]

09. "ŧ IV. We shall rapidly glance, then, at the material of decoration hence derived. And now I cannot, as I before have done respecting construction, convince the reader of one thing being wrong, and another right. I have confessed as much again and again; I am now only to make appeal to him, and cross-question him, whether he really does like things or not."[Ruskin, John *The Stones of Venice: The foundations*. Smith, Elder, and co., 2013.]

10. "I would like to thank Mr. Mike Ashby, Ms. Susan Richter, and Professor Paul Turner for reading through my entire manuscript, correcting my English, and editing my writing at diﬀerent stages. They also oﬀered helpful comments on my work. Professor Turner even read diﬀerent versions of the introduction and helped me revise it. I am truly indebted to him for his great kindness and generosity."[Feng, Jiren, and Jie Li *Chinese architecture and metaphor : Song culture in the Yingzao fashi building manual*.

12. "9 Earth has not anything to show more fair: Dull would he be of soul who could pass by A sight so touching in its majesty: The City now doth, like a garment, wear The beauty of the morning; silent, bare, Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie Open unto the fields, and to the sky; All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. Never did sun more beautifully steep In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill: Ne’er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!"[Allinson, Kenneth *London's Contemporary Architecture, Fourth Edition: An Explorer's Guide*. 4th ed. Architectural Press, 2006.]

13. "Such recognition and action truly benefits our higher selves. We act in the face of oppression, dispossession, or occupation so that our own humanity may not be diminished by our silence when some part of the human family is being demeaned. If something lessens your worth as a human being, then it lessens mine as well. To act in your defense is really to act in defense of my ‘self’ – whether my higher present self or my vulnerable future self."[Parry, William *Against the Wall: The Art of Resistance in Palestine*. Chicago Review Press, 2011.]

14. "My anxiety to reach Rome was so great, and it so grew with me every moment, that to think of stopping anywhere was quite out of the question; even in Florence, I only stayed three hours. Now I am here at my ease, and as it would seem, shall be tranquilized for my whole life; for . From "Travels In Italy. "Translated by A. J . W. MorrIson and Charles Nisbet."[Halsey 2010.]

15. "Sometimes I would find what I was looking for, and sometimes I would not. I had intended to include Belfast in this book, but life had other plans. My bag, containing most of my possessions, all of my handwritten research, my passport, vast quantities of reference photographs and all my essays, was stolen on the way to the airport to fly there. Belfast would have to take a back seat as I began the process of piecing the project back together from scraps."[Brown, Lorna *Painted Cities: Illustrated Street Art Around the World*. Anima, 2018.]

16. "Waiting in the front hall for someone who did not want to answer my questions didn’t bother me. I was curious to look inside, and even more so to see what remained of the former slave quarters out back (some were renovated into children’s playhouses). Yet, what is unforgettable about these living quarters is the upholstery and oriental rugs. Many of them were worn threadbare in places, and draping the windows were linen and brocade so sun-damaged that light was leaking through them."[Caples, Sara, and Everardo Jefferson *The New Mix: Culturally Dynamic Architecture (Architectural Design September   October 2005 Vol. 75, No. 2)*. Wiley, 2005.]

17. "The following is an example of what he chose to suppress in version 1: It seems necessary to refer to certain personal details, even at the risk of transgressing the bounds of good taste. From this point of view, I may say that the Pottery came as a very unexpected growth, a thing as it were, suddenly forced upon me by others as a result of a series of Page 177 disappointments, grievances and contentions, rather than through my own deliberate choice."[Reed, Cleota *Henry Chapman Mercer and the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works*. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996.]

18. "Leaked Karma in the paint?The faint, dissipating perfume of the soul?It gives one pause. 21 Thankfully, it is not for us to decide here if ghosts are real. A lack of evidence has kept skeptics and believers battling it out for some time, and no doubt will continue to do so long into the future. Rather it is for us, as individuals, to decide how we feel about these buildings and their “ghosts. ” The line between the ghosts of our imaginings and the possibility of real haunts seems perilously thin."[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America's Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]

19. "As I slowly picked my route down I could see Jean-Pierre waiting for me fifty feet below. Soon I was answering his questions as best I could. While I was a bit disappointed, or at least confused, by what I had found, he seemed elated. It all seemed to fit in with his theory. I was dying for a cold bottle of water and left a bit precipitously. We agreed we would download my pictures onto his computer at the hotel so he could do the analysis."[Brier, Bob, and Jean-Pierre Houdin *The secret of the great pyramid : how one man's obsession led to the solution of ancient Egypt's greatest mystery*. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2008.]

20. "That makes a lot of sense to me as a reader of your book. One can really feel these interdisciplinary interests. The book has several intellectual imprints … Yeah. After three years at Berkeley I went to India for three months. I had a very amazing, immersive experience, staying with families in seven major cities, plus a week in a nunnery in a small village."[Roesler, Sascha, and Madlen Kobi *The Urban Microclimate as Artifact: Towards an Architectural Theory of Thermal Diversity*.

21. "When I was in the third and fourth grades, I lived with my family in the small town of Pardeville, Wisconsin. At that time my father was deathly ill, and we struggled, like many families, to make ends meet. But as an adult, my memories of that period in my life are softened by the thoughts of my daily summertime fishing activities. There were two lakes in town, and every day that the sun shined I made my way down to the lower lake with my friend Richard Deitman."[Kylloe, Ralph *Cabin in the Woods*. Gibbs Smith, 2007.]

22. "Using a different approach to representation raises questions about the ‘habitability’ of the representation itself; that is, about how it can invite you past its own surface. I find similar problems in representation with text and while I use text extensively in my work it is often in a form which acknowledges this difficulty. I spend some time labouring over the words and have a programme which will then display them as a fine grid floating apparently within the image like a fog."[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]

23. "What I think was really meant but not actually observed was the vitality of personal relationships among people who know one another well, the face-to-face relationships. Of course, this relates to what I was attempting to say in my own presentation. Towns are arrangements of people who enjoy personal relationships with one another. Either they know one another very well or they are strangers."[(Editor), Jonathan G. Katz *Architecture as Symbol and Self-Identity*. Aga Khan Award for Architecture, 1980.]

24. "But then don't you believe that a man's body [and here I quote Mr. Crowley], a body with a soul, clad in light pajamas, in falling from a height of one hundred seventy-seven feet [53 m]. could have been ballooned out of the wall, by a wind gust of a speed of thirty-five miles per hour [56 km/ h]. Couldn't that be a much greater distance than your estimated twelve feet [3. 6 m], let's say, as much as nineteen feet [5. 7 m] from the wall?"[Levy, Matthys, and Mario Salvadori *Why buildings fall down: how structures fail*. W.W. Norton, 1992.]

They do not limp, but simply stump along.
