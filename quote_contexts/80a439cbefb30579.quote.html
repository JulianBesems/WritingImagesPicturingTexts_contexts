    <pre>2.5 ARCHITECTONIC OBSTACLE The use of machine learning to encode the objects of domains entails that the model is embedded within the domain as much as the objects it encodes. Encoding is therefore never simply the extraction of properties from the thing itself, but the production of differences through a particular apparatus of discernment. In Hegels Observing Reason the topic of Differentiae corresponds to relevant questions as to how we shall relate to the ordered sets of information that are curated by machine learning and the encoding of these objects into vectors as to distinguish them from each other. The &quot;features&quot;, as the dimensions of these vectors are often referred to, behave in similar fashion to the differentiae, in that they certainly have an essential connection to the object it encodes, however they are as much and possibly to a larger extent a characteristic of the model which makes this encoding: its training, priors, and operative constraints. In accordance as to how the differentiae are essentially connected to the cognition which discerns them. The obstacle is therefore not only that domains differ, but that the very means by which they are made comparable is itself situated and partial.

<em>The machine learning model, as the apparatus of discernment, not only differentiates between objects within a domain but also establishes the very criteria for what constitutes a domain in the first place. This raises the question of how to account for the model&#x27;s own situatedness and partiality in its encoding of the world. In other words, how can we reconcile the model&#x27;s objective claims to represent the world with its own subjective and partial nature?</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Perhaps the skill of making and testing such interpretations can help get at the essence of activity in the world. 11 Representation and indexicality World models As an agent gets along in the world, its actions are plainly about the world in some sense. In picking up a cup, I am not just extending my forearm and adjusting my fingers: those movements can be parsimoniously described only in relation to the cup and the ways that cups are used.&quot;[Agre, Philip E. *Computation and Human Experience*. Cambridge University Press, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;The contrast, therefore, lies 94 deeper, and can be characterized exhaustively only by introducing the concept of an objectively valid regularity. T he sensations produced by objects are private, and vary from one individual to another. But the world picture, the world of objects, is the same for all human beings, and we may say that the transition from the sense world to the world picture amounts to a replacement of a disordered subjective manifold by a constant objective order, of chance by law, and of variable appearance by stable substance.&quot;[Planck, Max *Scientific Autobiography And Other Papers*. Planck Philosophical Essays in English P2P Custom Ed V5 [UL]. Williams &amp; Norgate, 1950.]</li>
<li>&quot;In the preceding discussion what was modified was the object of the prediction— the occurrence. For we related the occurrences not to the directly given sense world, but to an artificially created 1 4 5 world picture, and we thus found it possible to determine occurrences accurately. But instead of modifying the object of predictions we can alter our notion of the subject of the prediction, that is, of the predicting intellect. For every prediction presupposes somebody who does the predicting. Therefore, in the following discussion we shall direct our attention solely to the predicting subject, and shall consider as the objects of prediction the directly given occurrences of the sense world, without introducing an artificial world picture.&quot;[Planck, Max *Scientific Autobiography And Other Papers*. Planck Philosophical Essays in English P2P Custom Ed V5 [UL]. Williams &amp; Norgate, 1950.]</li>
<li>&quot;(Stachel 2002, 249) One difficulty in understanding this proposal comes from Stachel’s use of the term “model. ” If this is a thesis only about models—that is, that which is used to represent the world—then it is hard to see how it could be supported by GP, a thesis about the relation between models and the world. If, however, we take the proposal to concern particles and space-time points themselves, the proposal suggests that such objects are structurally individuated. The intuitive idea here seems to be that models related by permutation attribute the same structure to the world, and hence, if objects are picked out by that structure, these models attribute the same properties to the same objects.&quot;[Guay, Alexandre, and Thomas Pradeu (eds.) *Individuals Across the Sciences*. Oxford University Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;The perfect objective world, as Josiah Royce said, is thus actually a transcendental structure, logically timeless, but remaining always contestable (Royce, 1976 [1899]: 73). To the surprise of some logicians, one can say that we actually 208 Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith live in a ‘possible world’, an ‘objective reality’ held tentatively in place by our mutually imagined projection on the brute evidence of the undoubted real. No wonder that it is believed that ‘a spiritual . . . affinity’ binds the social (Geertz 1996: 42).&quot;[Wright, Edmond *Narrative, Perception Language and Faith*. 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;N o th in g could be more shortsighted than such a view. Fo r if we stop to think that the improvement of the world picture goes hand in hand with an approach to the metaphysically &quot;real world,&quot; the expectation that the definitions and concepts of the objectively real world picture will not diverge too much from the framework created by the classical world picture, amounts basically to a demand that the metaphysically real world be completely intelligible in terms of ideas derived from the former naive world picture.&quot;[Planck, Max *Scientific Autobiography And Other Papers*. Planck Philosophical Essays in English P2P Custom Ed V5 [UL]. Williams &amp; Norgate, 1950.]</li>
<li>&quot;Consider the very simple case of a world with two exactly similar material objects: clearly, such a world exhibits twice the mass of a world with only one such object. Generalizing from this type of thought-experimental scenarios, it seems right to claim that the naturalist, aiming to only formulate scientifically grounded metaphysical claims, need not, and should not, take indiscernibility as a criterion of individuation for objects but, rather, for worlds.&quot;[Guay, Alexandre, and Thomas Pradeu (eds.) *Individuals Across the Sciences*. Oxford University Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;The representations over which the visual operators apply are retinocentric and thus not objective world models. A retinal image is a poor world model because it encodes only the most primitive information about the world. It does not encode the identities or structural relations of the visible materials. Furthermore, a retinal image is not a world model because its relation to outside events depends on the agent&#x27;s location and orientation. Pengi, it is true, always has the same location and orientation, but other systems employing the same technology need not.&quot;[Agre, Philip E. *Computation and Human Experience*. Cambridge University Press, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;One notion of visibility is that real-worldly objects have to ‘reside’ somewhere in the world where one could go looking to find them. This residence is not a ‘place’ in the real world, but is the constituted sense of an object as accountably locatable in the world, either physically or through knowing how to look via some technical operation. That location assures it various properties, one of which is its ‘objective’ visibility. We are not, however, concerned here with deciding the objective existence of social objects, nor are we interested in the distinction Husserl makes,as a traditional problem in philosophy, between the ideal object and the real or experiential one.&quot;[Garfinkel, Harold *Ethnomethodological Studies of Work*. 1986.]</li>
<li>&quot;This assumption is actually valid in certain situations, as when the agent is a computer program that interacts only with other computer programs and not with the world outside the computer. Normally, though, simply expressing the continuing identity of an object does not suffice to keep track of the object in a 248 Computation and human experience causal sense. Sometimes it is imagined, somewhat more reasonably, that the agent stores a set of spatial coordinates for each such object, updating the stored values each time any fresh knowledge about the object&#x27;s whereabouts becomes available, as part of the general process of maintaining an objective world model.&quot;[Agre, Philip E. *Computation and Human Experience*. Cambridge University Press, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;We can speak intelligibly about something being an object only in so far as it can be presented as such to a subject. And in so far as it is presented, it must satisfy the most fundamental conditionsÂ€– namely, having temporal and spatial coordinates and being causally related to other objects or eventsÂ€– for something to be an object for that subject. The weaker view makes no reference to the non-existence of unperceived objects. The onus, rather, is on what can count as an object. We can now understand better the role time plays in the overall design of Schopenhauer’s system.&quot;[Hammer, Espen *Philosophy and Temporality from Kant to Critical Theory*. Cambridge University Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Neither seem anti-subjective or object/thing-related approaches proper to cope with the problem as they reject what is in the center of the research we suggested: A post-ontological consideration of space and place. By that we refer to the necessarily incorporated, but yet ontological character of spatial aspects of the life-world, which alone makes it possible to reconstruct them as first-grade-constructions (like any other life-world-constructions; Schütz 1967 [1932], chap. 43 ff. ). The phenomenological approach ideally should allow life-world experiences to reveal itself in its own terms.&quot;[(eds.), Bruce B. Janz *Place, Space and Hermeneutics*. Springer International Publishing, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Only after this can it properly turn to that more exciting realm of rational speculation concerning the cosmology within which it sees itself as functioningby an imaginative extension of its grounded cognitive claims to the ultimate nature and structure of the things of the world and the world itself as one whole. Systematic metaphysics is then from the outset bound by its own interpretative categories. It cannot be reduced to intellectual reporting; it cannot claim to provide particular factual truths describing specifics of the world.&quot;[Neville, Robert C. *New Essays in Metaphysics*. SUNY Press, 1986.]</li>
<li>&quot;The essentialist features of universalistic mapping overrides such exploration. The platial approach advocates a return to the life world in its particularity and contingency as a living landscape. This particularistic focus allows us to differentiate the universalistic concept of the world by speaking of it in terms of a world qua plurality of contextual webs of meanings. Thus we can say, to be human means to be in a place, however, place in itself is not one but many. Thirdly, used as a hermeneutical tool, place enables to understand the particular conditions constitutive of experience in a way that helps to address the problem of privacy discussed in the first section.&quot;[(eds.), Bruce B. Janz *Place, Space and Hermeneutics*. Springer International Publishing, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;If, as Quine (1969, 1) has it, “we are prone to talk and think of objects,” it is surely not sufficient to think of an object to be entitled to conclude that there exists an object that we are thinking about. But it is also not sufficient to think of a really existing individual object, which our mind sets apart from the rest of the whole world in order to think of it, to be entitled to view that object as being really or in itself apart from the rest of the world.&quot;[Guay, Alexandre, and Thomas Pradeu (eds.) *Individuals Across the Sciences*. Oxford University Press, 2015.]</li>
