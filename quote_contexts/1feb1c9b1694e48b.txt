09. "And whenever the logic of original and copy, first and second, is operative, there, too, is a linear logic of time.

11.

15. "It cannot be 58 Of Struction a question of establishing limits for what, in itself, ignores the limit. Either this limitlessness will be self-destructive—a construction that goes up but only to fall down right at the end—or we will find a way to recognize “sense” in struction—at the place where there is neither end, nor means, nor assembly, nor disassembly, nor top, nor bottom, nor east, nor west."[Barrau, Aurélien, Travis Holloway, Flo Mechain, and Jean-Luc Nancy *What's these worlds coming to?*.
