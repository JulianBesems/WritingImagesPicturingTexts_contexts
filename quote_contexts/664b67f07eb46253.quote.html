    <pre>Specifically, the work proposes an architectonic reading of the multimodal gap: the inherent misalignment between image and text that remains ingrained in machine learning embeddings. Rather than treating this gap as a technical flaw to be overcome, it is reframed as a conceptual opportunity. Drawing from Simondon’s notion of transduction, Foucault’s analysis of Magritte’s pipe, and the epistemic logic of architectural modalities, the multimodal gap is approached as a productive obstacle for speculation.</pre>

<li>&quot;My speculation on the relation between architecture and photography is only a step in the direction of a more comprehensive critique of current architectural discourse; its theorization has yet to be taken up in a more comprehensive fashion. If, as Howard Caygill notes, in the most sustained treatment of Benjamin’s speculation on architecture to date, “all experience for Benjamin is technological, since the term technology designates the artificial organization of perception,”61 and if architecture for Benjamin is a “concrete a priori,” or “canonical art form,” and therefore the most effective means to technologically organize experience, then it warrants and indeed requires a media theory.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork &lt;i&gt;Walter Benjamin and architecture&lt;/i&gt;.

<li>&quot;By the same token, however, we should guard against reading Benjamin too optimistically as assuming that the anaesthetization and alienation wreaked by technology on the human sensorium could be overcome. 13 Hansen’s last comment is instructive in guarding against the often over-optimistic, and even euphoric, reading of the role of new technology in architecture. It contains an important critical lesson that has yet to be investigated and integrated into the contemporary architectural discourse. Let me close this prologue by setting the terms under which the actuality of Benjamin can be claimed, including the legacy of his “media theory” and its possible implications for architecture as a form of “media. ” I shall return to this point in my afterword.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork &lt;i&gt;Walter Benjamin and architecture&lt;/i&gt;. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Today, architecture is being reduced to the practice of “building images. ”60 In a society saturated by images, the aesthetic practice of architecture has increasingly become “photogenic. ” Against this, it should rather become “photographic,” in the sense I elaborated above. From the misguided idea of architecture as “Sign” in its different variations in the 1970s, the discourse of building has merely moved towards another version as “ image-making,” or “hyperbuilding,” conceived as a form of “media. ” The resulting anaestheticization is the consequence of a failure to “reimagine the aesthetic” of building within the paradigm of the new technology.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork &lt;i&gt;Walter Benjamin and architecture&lt;/i&gt;.

<li>&quot;Fundamental to this distanciation is architecture’s internalization of technique through recollection of the tectonic. What this entails is that a discussion of ‘image’, as one consequence of the introduction of mediatic technologies into architectural discipline, although it has proliferated diverse and innovative approaches to design, nevertheless dismisses the culture of building, thus putting limitations on the scope of criticism. To speak of the tectonic relationship between column and wall, for example, does not mean to dismiss the perceptual realm offered by the mediatic technologies.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork &lt;i&gt;Walter Benjamin and architecture&lt;/i&gt;. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Each 36 The Architectural Representation of Reality of those traditions is, in fact, a reinterpretation of one or more pre-existing ones, although patrons and architects often prefer to represent them as new. The connection between this second stratum and an underlying long-cycle tradition is, as one would expect from any representation, not logical but transversal. Before proposing five representational clusters into which to roughly group these shorter-cycle traditions so they become accessible to research, it seems useful to adjust the conventional paradigm of the analysis of worldwide building.&quot;[Aart J.J. Mekking, Eric Roose &lt;i&gt;The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison&lt;/i&gt;. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Conversely, architecture as a discipline focuses on the permanence of the architectural object and the myth of its perfectability. DeLanda’s synthetic understanding of cities is inherently destabilizing to architecture because it elevates material factors to the same level as cultural production. The current fascination with fluidity may serve as a catalyst toward a new understanding of architectural processes. However, the preoccupation with representations of fluidity as built form restricts us to rigidly conventional architectural discourse.&quot;[Vincent James, Jennifer Yoos &lt;i&gt;VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects&lt;/i&gt;. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Ultimately, the architectural languages of Jones, Harries, and Thiis-Evensen are all provocative hermeneutical explications. They demonstrate the prolific interpretive possibilities that a text—in this case, architecture—offers. They demonstrate that, as with any hermeneutical project, the understanding of any text is multivalent, always underway, and never complete. The work of these three architectural thinkers is inspiring and motivates researchers to forge other innovative hermeneutic renditions of architectural expression, experience, and meaning.
