Selected: In designing architecture, you are not only designing a non-human, non-organic space; you are also dealing with a physiological, biological space. The interior atmosphere of a space affects us greatly, and if we don’t get enough light, we fall ill. Our intention for the project was to shift our view of architecture from a non-organic, almost Cartesian one, to something more atmospheric. Anyone inside a given space is biologically entangled in that surrounding. Our starting point is that space isn’t Â�empty at all, but, invariably, has a particular atmosphere with its own biological, electromagnetic and chemical qualities.[Roesler, Sascha, and Madlen Kobi *The Urban Microclimate as Artifact: Towards an Architectural Theory of Thermal Diversity*.

02. "Throughout the year the sun sends its glaring light during the long hours of the Middle Eastern day. Even in the dark nights of Mesopotamia, light sent by the moon’s brightness or even by the distant stars is sufficient for the creation of a sense of space, although one imbued with mystery. The natural response made by the Sumerians, therefore, was the development of an instinctive space conception tied to natural light—which led to the organisation of the inner court as a way of harnessing the light without the climatic disadvantage of heat gain."[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor & Francis Group, 2006.]

03. "Usually expressed as a percentage. Light which enters through the top part of an interior space, e. g. through clerestories, light ducts or rooflights. Skylight Light which has been scattered by molecules of air, aerosols and particles such as water droplets in clouds in the atmosphere; excludes direct beam."[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*. Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, 1999.]

04. "This means that, at low levels of ambient light, specific objects appear brighter than they would in brighter surroundings. 14 It is precisely this effect that Lewerentz exploits at St Mark’s. In the general darkness of the interior the intense patches of natural and artificial light stand out in ever shifting relationships. The space is not merely lit, but becomes a composition of lights."[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]

05. "1 The construction of a building enclosure inevitably limits the range of illumination that exists under the open sky. The amount of light that enters an interior is determined by the size and position of windows and rooflights and the reflectance of the materials that line internal space. In principle, the range of possibilities is almost infinite, but in common practice empirical conventions impose limits that ensure adequate lighting for practical purposes."[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]

06. "Good lighting can create a warm atmosphere, highlight a beautiful object or transform the character of an interior by introducing areas of light and shadow. Bleak, overhead and bare light bulbs make a space seem unfriendly and unrelaxing, while a few table lamps or uplights can make a room seem soothing and welcoming. Light that’s too bright just dazzles and drains, and a dim, dark room is depressing. There are three different types of lighting: Renno Planner pages 23/6/05 2:13 PM Page 112 112—planning your perfect home renovation ■ Atmospheric—Ambient or atmospheric refers to a room’s overall lighting and the mood it creates."[May, Alex *Planning Your Perfect Home Renovation: Save time and money with this essential guide to fuss-free home improvements*. 2005.]

07. "Daylight is necessary or light is necessary, to see the dirt in the corners of the room, and to keep the place clean. However, for that purpose artiﬁcial light can be used” (C. I. E. and Macintyre 1928). The regulation of private life was adopted as the means to protect public health in Victorian England. Between 1862 and 1894, the London Building Acts had incrementally reduced the permitted heights of neighbouring buildings with respect to light several times."[Manfredi, Carlo *Addressing the Climate in Modern Age's Construction History: Between Architecture and Building Services Engineering*. Springer International Publishing, 2019.]

08. "The chamber usually has a light distribution that simulates the CIE standard overcast sky. Atrium An interior light space enclosed on two or more sides by the walls of a building and daylit from a roof of transparent or translucent material and, sometimes, from glazed ends or sides. It permits the entry of light to the other interior spaces linked to it by glazed or unglazed openings. Average daylight factor The average indoor illuminance on a reference plane or planes (usually the working plane) as a percentage of the simultaneous outdoor illuminance from the unobstructed sky."[Engineers, Chartered Institute of Building Services *Daylighting and Window Design (CIBSE Lighting Guide)*. Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, 1999.]

09. "People who live in so-called “space-saving” houses or apartments, on the other hand, where anything you say is audible almost everywhere, may have to retreat to the bathroom or go outdoors when they want to be alone or speak confidentially. In a studio apartment the problem is magnified. LIGHT AND DARK A room that has many large windows can admit more light, and unless these windows are blocked by curtains and blinds we are apt to see the inhabitants as open-minded and cheerful. The effect is increased when the interior walls and furnishings are pale-hued."[Lurie, Alison *The Language of Houses: How Buildings Speak to Us*. Delphinium Books, 2014.]

10. "Factors that help to induce a sense of ‘place’, therefore, are given particular consideration. One of the most effective of these factors is light, to the extent that light and space are inseparable and that when light is eliminated from a space the emotional content of space disappears. The essence of architectural space lies in the interaction of the elements that define it. We can observe the relevance of the indivisible interplay of space and light in the case of the courtyard house."[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor & Francis Group, 2006.]

11. "Therefore, if we bring light into a dark room, the darkness disappears, and inasmuch as a soul is filled with good, evil will disappear. ”23 In packing many large windows into walls, Shakers gave to their buildings a state of transparency that revealed the world inside and out. Beyond its spiritual implications, this remarkable increase in the traffic of light served a more rational aim of making things lucid, exposing every scrap of space and every human event to the scrutiny of vision and thought."[Plummer, Henry *Stillness and Light: The Silent Eloquence of Shaker Architecture*. Indiana University Press, 2009.]

12. "Reporting on one of his visits to the United States, van der Leeuw criticized the treatment of the workforce as well as the effect of the buildings’ construction on workers. He faulted the broad expanse of the manufacturing space for preventing natural light from entering the middle section of the ﬂoor, with the result that some working areas depended on artiﬁcial light all day long. He also criticized the use of mercury tubular lamps, which produced a disagreeable blue daylight color."[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]

13. "Additionally, it can be anticipated that fire will burn differently as it has new avenues for extension due to the remodeling. •• Renovated/remodeled occupancies are an indicator that a building may have a higher occupant load and a different floor plan than the original building. 239 The Art of Reading Buildings Light Wells, Skylights, and Atriums Light wells A light well or air shaft was originally an unroofed vertical shaft within a building and primarily used to provide sufficient light and ventilation to rooms within the interior of a building."[Dodson, David W., and John Mittendorf *The Art of Reading Buildings*. PennWell,Fire Engineering Books, 2014.]

14. "This appears to be a successful therapy with no side-effects. Researchers at Tokyo University have now produced a titanium dioxide chemical coating for wall and ﬂoor tiles that reacts with UV light to break down dirt, grime and bacteria. Could this mark the end of toxic cleaning ﬂuids?Light and colour 45 Light and the built environment Physiologically, biologically and psychologically we are profoundly affected by the quality and quantity of light and colour determined by a building’s location, orientation and interior spaces."[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]

15. "He adds: “intention: a human being, on the one hand, with a gestating idea, which he exteriorises for those who look, live and experience – in other words once again a human being, another human being and so on. Thus architecture needs a human language”. 11 For Le Corbusier it is indubitably light which links the terms of language expressed in an architectural work: “As you can imagine, I use light freely; light for me is the fundamental basis of architecture. I compose with light”. 12 Light sources are used sparingly but their positioning is of capital importance when defining the interior volumes."[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]

16. "Uplighting and walls washed with light create visual interest and a gentle contrast to enhance the interplay of colour and texture. Individual workstation task lighting to suit the type of activity being carried out can add to the general lighting environment. Highly reﬂective surfaces, glare and over-brightness should be avoided to reduce visual fatigue and eye strain. Low-grade computer software producing poorly deﬁned images is another source of disturbing visual stress. Architectural interior features of colour and texture will modify the overall quality of light."[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]

17. "In Mies’s concert hall collage, the tension between the foreground ﬁgure and the bomber in the background deﬁnes both the boundary of the building’s interior (across the dark, then light ﬂoor plane) and its “openness” into or onto the surrounding ﬁeld (the one from which we view the interior and the one that admits light from the rear). Stating that transparency results from opacity suggests that elements which resist X-ray penetration are the real basis of seeing through and seeing beyond, whether they are thick or thin."[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]

18. "This isolates the interior spaces from the exterior walls, preventing the transfer of noise and vibration. (Photo courtesy of Undercurrent Architects) The building shell is made from weathered steel that fits in with the industrial nature of the area. With limited surrounding area views, a large skylight provides views of the sky and the distant treetops, while also flooding the interior with light. The central atrium is brightly lit by the natural light coming in through the glass roof."[Koones, Sheri *Prefabulous World: Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Homes Around the Globe*. Abrams, 2014.]

19. "Thermal comfort – The user experiences discomfort if they are too hot or too cold. This occurs when the temperature, humidity, airflow and radiant sources within a space are not kept within an acceptable range. This exact balance of these factors will vary depending on what activity is occurring within the space and at what intensity, as well as what the occupants are wearing. Visual comfort – A space becomes uncomfortable if there is not sufficient light to undertake the task required by the user. This level will vary depending on the activity."[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*. Ambra Verlag, 2013.]

20. "Light also enters directly through the windows in the south wall, but is subdued by the depth of the splays, thus diffusing only a scant supply of light inside. Conversely, in order to create a twilight mood at certain times of day with more diffuse lighting, indirect light sources are used, such as the strips of openings above the side doors or the brise-lumière in the towers of the side chapels."[Pauly, Daniele *Le Corbusier: the Chapel at Ronchamp*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2008.]

21. "I am not suggesting that Shakers gazed upon windows in such a manner, but that, beyond creating visual equilibrium, the concentrated light has a subtle and largely unconscious effect of keeping eye and mind calm, and perpetually centered, rather than dispersed or distracted. The power of balanced lighting to settle space, and furnish an atmosphere of repose, reached an apogee in the Shaker meetinghouse."[Plummer, Henry *Stillness and Light: The Silent Eloquence of Shaker Architecture*. Indiana University Press, 2009.]

22. "Successful lighting in a more supporting or secondary role is usually evaluated for efficient illumination, matching light levels to speciﬁc activities, limiting glare from direct sunlight with shading devices, and providing electronic controls that reduce waste. Innovative light ﬁxtures that are more efficient, “smart” (responsive to human interaction) and playful have the potential to make the qualities of light integral to interior design (Brownell 2006: 204–16). Fiberoptic cable technology allows daylight to be transported to interior rooms that cannot risk sparks from conventional electrical devices, such as testing laboratories with non-oxygen or all-oxygen atmospheres, and to illuminate rooms without mechanical devices."[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]

23. "Instinctive decisions to approach or retreat are human responses to environmental stimuli, and this instinct is most reliable when the potential threat can be seen clearly. Artiﬁcial light has the ability to both provide general illumination and direct attention, and it is in this role that it supports human sentiment. Just as a chandelier in a dining room centers the space over the table, a center light enhances a feeling of coming together and of focus in a room meant for conferences."[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]

24. "Additionally, open light wells will also tend to dissipate concentrations of heat, smoke and fire as compared to enclosed light wells, particularly those that have been covered over at a later date. If a light well has been covered over, this modification can not only increase concentrations of heat, smoke, and fire within the light well due to inadequate ventilation, but also increase the possibility of a backdraft if oxygen is suddenly introduced within the light well by opening windows. Likewise, the light well cover may not be constructed in a manner that can hold a firefighter’s weight—creating a fall hazard."[Dodson, David W., and John Mittendorf *The Art of Reading Buildings*. PennWell,Fire Engineering Books, 2014.]

25. "It is necessary, however, to take into account the reflected sky-light as well as the direct sky-light. The amount of daylight arriving at a certain point in a building may, in fact, reach this point as direct sky-light, as externally-reflected sky-light or as internally-reflected sky-light. The sky-light factor is equal to the ratio of the daylight falling on a surface in the building to that on a horizontal surface of the same size outside the building. It is often of importance in the design of a building to be able to pre-estimate the daylight factors in different rooms."[(auth.), Rune Persson *Flat Glass Technology*. Springer US, 1969.]
