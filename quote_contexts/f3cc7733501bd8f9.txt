Selected: From paint­ ing to image, from image to text, from text to voice, a sort of imaginary pointer indicates, shows, fixes, locates, impose s a syste m of references, tries to sta­ bilize a unique space — How might we go about this in a digital context where description and image collapse? Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf

--- Context List ---
01. "*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&annotation=WA8NIH6S)"

02. "*Lemke noted (2002: 303) ‘No [written] text is an image. No text or visual representation means in all and only the same ways that text can mean. It is this essential incommensurability that enables genuine new meanings to be made from the combinations of modalities’.* — **-this is exactly the right way of putting it compared to earlier sentence** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=272&annotation=KAHF5HK6)"

03. "*The context shapes the resources available for meaning making and how these are selected and designed.* — **Check article by xy? In coding** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=269&annotation=RVVZVLII)"

04. "*Under the guise of reverting to a previous arrangement, it recovers its three functions-but in order to pervert them, there­ by disturbing all the traditional bonds oflanguage and the image.* — **This exactly expresses how text and image cannot in all situations be expressed in the same encoding. Because this subversion is only possible because image and text stand to each others proportion but not in one another's encoding.** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=34&annotation=SDLNYAT5)"

05. "*From paint­ ing to image, from image to text, from text to voice, a sort of imaginary pointer indicates, shows, fixes, locates, impose s a syste m of references, tries to sta­ bilize a unique space* — **How might we go about this in a digital context where description and image collapse?** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=42&annotation=Z28V8UDG)"

06. "*he text must say nothing to this gazing subject who is a viewer, not a reader. As soon as he begins to read, in fact, shape dissipates.* — **Again CLIP:, here this also characterises how the image does not express more than the text and the existing context from which the imagery is inferred.** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=36&annotation=WKUPEMTK)"

07. "*And it is in vain that we attempt to show, by the use of images, metaphors, or similes, what we are saying; the space where they achieve their splendor is not that de­ ployed by our eyes but that defined by the sequential ele­ ments of syntax. And the proper name, in this context, is merely an artifice: it gives us afinger to point with, in other words, to pass surreptitiously from the space where one speaks to the space where one looks; in other words, to fold one over the other as if they were equivalents. 6* — **Very relevant to GPT and images and text** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=21&annotation=UPX922IN)"

08. "*There is a large body of multimodal research that explores the dynamics of the interaction between image and language.* — **Interesting but to me it seems to fall into the same pitfalls where meaning is seen as a singularly defined unifying mapping of the modalities. However this fails to acknowledge that the modalities need to remain in their domain to bear this meaning. This collapsing them and studying them by means of analysing meaning seems odd to me. However further and closer reading is needed.

Primary argument is that our approach is an active one where it navigates domains to put something forward which inherently relies on a different approach where this research is employing an analytical method to study how understanding is derived from multimodal sources . (Analysis vs Algebra?)** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=275&annotation=7RJ5TVJQ)"

09. "*Either the text is ruled by the image (as in those paintings where a book , an inscrip­ tion, a letter, or the name of a person are represented); or else the image is ruled by the text (as in books where a draw ing complet es, as if it were merely tak­ ing a short cut, the mess age that words are charged to represent)* — **Important to understand the dynamic** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=44&annotation=7D7LXDYL)"

10. "*Thus the interaction between modes is significant for meaning making.* [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=268&annotation=3TX4L987)"
