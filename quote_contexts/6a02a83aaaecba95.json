It is a space where the technical and the aesthetic, the functional and the speculative, the measurable and the immeasurable, all converge. And it is here, in this liminal space, that architecture's synthetic intelligence truly resides. The BIM model is not just a tool for optimizing performance, but a medium for exploring the tensions and resonances between different modes of thinking, drawing, and modelling. It is a medium that amplifies the complexity of architectural design, and allows us to navigate the abundance of information and references that characterize contemporary architectural practice.", "suggest_context": "A BIM model belongs very clearly to the first stance: it is a picture of a building, articulated as a totality of facts. Architectural practice, however, behaves much more like Wittgensteins later language-games: drawings, models, texts, films and conversations do not simply mirror a building; they continuously renegotiate what it is, as it is designed, discussed, and inhabited. The question is thus not whether geometry is necessary, of course it is, but what happens when an entire digital ecology is organised as if architecture were only what can be pictured in this way. From its origins, architecture has demanded a synthetic intelligence; one that navigates and negotiates between modes of thinking, drawing, modelling, scripting, narrating. As we have seen in the work of Vitruvius, Alberti, Tschumi, Ando, Koolhaas and Ishigami, architecture arises through the tensions and resonances between different kinds of concerns, interests and domains of content. Studio practice relies on a navigation through abundance: models, drawings, texts and references linger, are re-seen and re-read over time. This multimodal capacity sustains architectures discursive and speculative scope. In the contemporary digital condition, this abundance is amplified by the global network Jorge Orozco Esquivel describes: information circulates ad infinitum and objects are characterized from many indexes rather than by single definitions. What are the consequences when the qualitative, the speculative, and the non-geometric dimensions of architecture lose their footing in computational discourse? If computational architecture concludes with functional analysis and optimisation, it risks severing its connection to this open-ended, playful dimension. As Brian Eno states in his book What Art Does, The art engagement begins where the functional engagement ends. His framing is not a definition of art, but an inquiry into what art does; how it operates, resonates, and affects. This operational perspective parallels Timothy Gowerss observation that a mathematical object is what it does. These positions suggest that both art and mathematics fields architecture has always negotiated closely are constituted by actions and effects, not static definitions. Applied to architecture, this implies that its capacity to think and feel through space resides less in formal analysis alone than in the way its media operate across modalities, often through affect, ambiguity, and non-linear intuition. Eno further writes, Feelings are known as fuzzy, hard to pin down, impossible to measure... In a technical culture like Western culture things you can't count, don't count. And we recall the complementary condition Orozco describes on the web, cited in 1.1.1, in which the measure sits outside of correctness, beauty or linguistic understanding, but is rooted in symbolic probability. Both point to a domain of operations that are neither simply subjective nor simply logical, but nevertheless structure how things matter. In such a context that privileges what can be counted, architecture should remain attuned to what resists straightforward quantification, and to the \"soft\", process-based, atmospheric meters by which buildings and projects actually start to count."}
