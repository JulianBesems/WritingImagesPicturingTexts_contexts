Selected: A screen reader is simply a program that does some analysis of the text that appears on a screen, or in a window, and passes it to a text-to-speech synthesizer. Most screen readers are phenomenally unintelligent about their analysis of what is on the screen. Commonly, for example, they will read a text line-by-line, without any consideration of what kind of text it is and therefore whether it is appropriate to read it in that fashion—for example, in the case of poetry or a list of short bullet items; or if it is ordinary prose text, such as what 244 Language, Technology, and Society you are reading now, where line breaks serve no function other than to Wt text on the page.[Sproat, Richard *Language, Technology, and Society*. 2010.]

02. "Of course, for all of its widespread use for more than 150 years, telegraphy remained largely the domain of specialists. Very few people learned how to operate telegraphs, or the Morse code needed to send the signals. It was not until the widespread availability of computers that electronic communication of text became available in practice to everyone. The history and some of the design features of computer coding systems for text are the topic of the next section. 6. 2. 2. 2 EBCDIC and ASCII Computers represent text as a sequence of numbers."[Sproat, Richard *Language, Technology, and Society*. 2010.]

03. "To simplify this text analysis the author has obtained a computerized version of the three catechisms. 1 This includes a reverse-order dictionary, a word-frequency dictionary, an item-locating dictionary listing every separate word with its specific location in the texts, and a search capability that can produce a list of all words in the texts with any desired sequence of letters. Of course this does not yield any information that was not available earlier by counting, but it saves considerable time."[(Ed.), Anders Ahlqvist *Papers from the 5th International Conference on Historical Linguistics, Galway, April 6–10 1981*. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1982.]

04. "", excluding temporal reference as a structuring device, suggesting either an object-oriented organization or a structure which follows the spatial organization of the picture. The characteristics of the first text segment with respect to the referential movement correspond to what has been said for descriptive texts. The referential fillers show properties typical for this text type: the time reference is unspecified, and the predicates are all unbounded states. At the end of text CI the same picture emerges again."[Dietrich, Rainer, and Carl F Graumann *Language processing in social context*. North-Holland, 1989.]

05. ". . Writers are not only inscribing text. They are also repeatedly rereading text that they’ve written, revising text as they write as well as going back later to revise, pausing to read other texts (their own notes, texts they have written, source materials, inspirations), pausing to think and plan. (Prior 2004: 170) The context of production and the activities that this encompasses are seen as part of the whole practice of text production. A text is accomplished through the organisation of language resources, but its meaning relies on its relationship to other previous texts, other similar texts and to the knowledge brought to its reading by a reader."[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

06. "The solution offered by feature-based grammars and typed-feature logic seemed, for a while a sort of definite solution for every parsing problem, but despite its formal clarity and neatness it soon appeared inefficient for the needs that were emerging from the market of natural language products. . . .  Mass-parsing. In fact, the idea of producing a complete and deep analysis of sentences was losing appeal, as the more promising applications of the end of the Nineties became text analysis, text classification, and any other domain where large quantities of text were to be analysed."[Van Sterkenburg, P.

07. "Internet Relay Chat), instant messaging (ICQ, Yahoo!Instant Messenger), and graphical modes incorporating typed asynchronous and synchronous text (Second Life, Active Worlds). 1 These new modes of writing have spawned an academic specialty among linguists, sociologists, anthropologists, and communication researchers of ‘interactive written discourse’ (Ferrara et al. 1991), ‘electronic language’ (Collot and Belmore 1996), ‘Netspeak’ (Crystal 2006), or, most commonly, computer-mediated communication (CMC). 2 Compared to speech and to pre-digital writing, digital writing is, paradoxically, both doubly attenuated (diminished) and doubly enhanced (Figure 8. 1). 3 Digital text is attenuated because it lacks materiality."[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

08. "A translation in English also is provided, including an attempt to illustrate paraphasic errors. The cohesion analysis In Halliday and Hasan’s (1976) study of cohesion, text is referred to as any passage, spoken or written, of whatever length, that forms a unified whole. A text is considered to be a semantic unit of language in use whose cohesion  that is, what makes it a unified whole  is provided by the semantic relations among its elements. The occurrence of a pair of semantically related items in a text is defined as a tie , and, in a given text, five different patterns of ties can be found: reference , substitution, conjunction , lexical , and ellipsis."[Centeno, Jose G., Raquel T. Anderson, and Loraine K. Obler *Communication Disorders in Spanish Speakers: Theoretical, Research and Clinical Aspects (Communication Disorders Across Languages)*. 2007.]

09. "To my mind, the most unfortunate instance of this (as also noted in Chapter 3) is the use of the term ‘ideograph’ to refer to Chinese characters (the usage goes at least back to Becker’s original Unicode88 proposal). Thus one can Wnd many references to ‘CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) ideographs’ (or ‘Han Ideographs’) in the Unicode literature. The ideographic myth surrounding Chinese characters has now, by act of committee, become part of the permanent lexicon of text technology. But complaints aside, electronic text technology has changed the equation for the mechanical input of text."[Sproat, Richard *Language, Technology, and Society*. 2010.]

10. "3. 2 KEY CONCEPTS TEXT AND DISCOURSE A text can be defined as any stretch of language which forms a unified whole, whether spoken, written or electronic. In a railway carriage, for example, you might be exposed to language such as: Alarm. Lift flap & pull handle. That’s all right, I’ll just get the Met. Any tickets from Stockport?Spurs on the slide as Butt posts late winner. Between London Euston – Manchester Pi. No, I’m on the train. Such disconnected scraps of language do not form a coherent whole and therefore do not constitute a text."[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

11. "Li and Thompson 1976, Givon 1985). What has been said here about main structure utterances within narrative texts applies analogously to other text types, for example descriptive texts. In that case, the focus is not an event which happened to a protagonist, but rather, for example, specification of some spatial location, of some visual property, as in (3) above (cf. for a discussion of different text types: van Dijk 1977, Wer lieh 1979, Rehbein 1984). 2. 2 Domains of Reference within an Utterance Before turning to the constraints which the quaestio imposes on the "filling" of various domains of reference within an utterance, it is necessary to have a brief look at the interplay of linguistic meaning proper and contextual information within an utterance."[Dietrich, Rainer, and Carl F Graumann *Language processing in social context*. North-Holland, 1989.]

12. " EXPRESSION AND CONTENT � 59  i   contains in itself an expression-form and a content-form. The    first stage of the analysis of a text must therefore be an analysis I  into these two entities. To be exhaustive, the analysis must be  so organized that at each stage we analyze into the parts that    i. e. , of  lowest number, either within  are of greatest extension,  the analyzed chain in its totality or within any arbitrary section    of it. If a text, for example, includesboth sentences and clauses,  we can show that the number of clauses  is greater than the nummust not proceed directly to an  ber of sentences; therefore we  analysis into clauses, but first analyze into sentences and then  analyze the sentences into clauses."[INPUT: Hjelmslev__Prolegomena_to_A_Theory_of_Language.pdf]

13. "But if the quaestio of Referential Movement in Descriptive and Narrative Discourse 53 the description fixes the p-domain as the focus element, then the two text types differ with respect to referential movement and topic/focus distribution. This is quite different for the last domain of reference considered here: predicates."[Dietrich, Rainer, and Carl F Graumann *Language processing in social context*. North-Holland, 1989.]

14. "It is also accepted that the discourse structure can be exploited in different natural language processing applications, such as summarisation, machine translation, natural language generation. Thus, research has been carried out to produce systems that automatically chunk discourse into segments and assign them labels according to some theory of discourse acts, the discourse parsers. Many of these attempts have been based on the recognition of the internal structure of discourse (see Kurohashi & Nagao 1994; Asher Lascarides 1993), but they failed to produce reliable results, especially with real texts."[Van Sterkenburg, P. G. J., and Republique tcheque International congress of linguists 17 Prague *Linguistics Today: Facing A Greater Challenge*. 2004.]

15. "The crucial question is: how typical is this example for the overall pattern of aspect use across Slavic?In order to abstract away from individual instances, the procedures outlined in Section 2. 2. above were applied: all nonconsistent examples were coded in a matrix of contexts intersected with language versions of the text and the overall differences between these versions were aggregated into a distance matrix. This was visualized in a neighbor net graph, shown in Figure 4. A further graph, shown in Figure 5, is based on Explorations into variation across Slavic: Taking a bottom-up approach 305 Figure 4."[Szmrecsanyi, Benedikt, and Bernhard Walchli *Aggregating Dialectology, Typology, and Register Analysis*.
