{"created_at": 1762045615.1667469, "confirmed": true, "origin": "zotero", "search_input": "The PhD thesis presented here revolves around the process of writing itself. Not in the way you might expect where the writing follows it\u2019s argument, and it traces a path throughout the 3 years spent on this research, but rather in a way where after three years the culmination of research is the process of writing this itself. To clarify, we are particularly interested in the writing as a process, in the same way that from an architectural research perspective one might be interested primarily in the process of the designing, not necessarily the outcome itself. But we digress here. The reason from mentioning this in the outset, is that the instrument in which this thesis was written is designed and developed itself, as a response to the journey of engaging with the phd research. So everything that is presented here is at once the presentation of the research within this text and images, as well as a result that provides the material of the research itself because it was written in the instrument it describes. Therefore as the writing was a back and forth process between the author and the instrument, the reader will be asked to engage in this relation as well where the text is both explanation and outcome. It proposes a similar engagement to an architect walking through a building in order to understand it rather than being presented with the plans straight away."}
