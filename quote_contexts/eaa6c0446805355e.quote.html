    <pre>It is as if one were in a cavern, hidden away, a place where one rediscovers ones origins and roots. They evoke the idea of a place beyond, a place to which one might aspire. They draw one towards a place that, ultimately, one is perhaps not allowed to enter. USED as Input: share least less keep long cut serious time become need paid something four known pretend came mistake first lot without broken quit giving view getting watch finally great high moving across miss year coming ago key sure station anyway cry Not everyone might try to enter a labyrinth or return unharmed from one; to enter it was equivalent to an initiation. The centre might be one of a variety of things. It is not just a different place, but a place that no longer exists at all. Our primitive psyches were not wired for that knowledge. Where once existed a familiar home, favorite shop, or longtime office, a place whose microcosm of geography we could easily and comfortably navigate its out the door, down the hall, on the left. . . , now there is a void.

<em>The void that once held our daily routines now stretches out before us like an endless expanse, a chasm that seems to grow wider with each passing day. We try to fill it with scraps of memory, but they only serve to highlight the emptiness. And yet, we are drawn to it, this void, as if it held the key to our very selves.  It is as if we are trying to recapture the past, to relive the moments we thought were so precious, but which now seem to belong to someone else.  We are left with nothing but the echoes of what once was, and the haunting sense that we are forever lost in the labyrinth of our own memories.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;It is not just a different place, but a place that no longer exists at all. Our primitive psyches were not wired for that knowledge. Where once existed a familiar home, favorite shop, or longtime office, a place whose microcosm of geography we could easily and comfortably navigate (it’s out the door, down the hall, on the left. . . ), now there is a void.&quot;[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America&#x27;s Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Entering these follies feels like entering an art gallery, where Thom Mayne’s idea of “daily life” also seems quaint and distant. But daily life is only part of what we, as spectators, leave at the door; we leave behind our selves as well.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;The grave has no doorway through which one may come and go. And to find oneself trapped in an enclosed place with no doorway is to find oneself alive in one’s own grave.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The name of the gateway is written above it: “Moment”. ’ Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 1883. trans. Hollingdale) Informal Occupation of Doorways Like the old man in Borges’s story, and notwithstanding Mongolian superstitions, we all find ourselves at one time or another occupying a doorway, on the step between one place and another.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Our present responses to doorways seem like dim echoes of distant chords; we need to tune in to those echoes to understand the simple and the subtle ways that doorways punctuate our lives and orchestrate our experience.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;What role does remembering “things my own way” have here?&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;I mean an ongoing daily process; they think of a printed authority. Suddenly, in this gap, emerges a mental image of me, shrunk like Alice moving through a world of words.&quot;[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Yet, like the factories of Philadelphia, they retain traces of glamor. For Stephen Barber, Broadway forms “a geographically linear graveyard” and provokes thoughts of cinema’s intimate relationship with death, decay and erasure. 115 Returning to Dimendberg’s terms, Lynch’s shots of Club Silencio’s baroque ceiling, red curtains and dusty downtown surroundings forge another branch of our “social memory bank,” in which the destruction of an entertainment culture formed around compact central precincts and collective experience can be deposited.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;“The delicacy of the plaster adds a certain fragility to the whole organic, serpent-structure; like an unwound ribbon, it lies in folds. For me, it evokes temptation and mystery—a halfway point between intrigue and well-being, and I would like to preserve the secret that surrounds its walls.&quot;[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;At one point, the Man from Another Place tells him,“This is the waiting room,” suggesting a space of permanent transition, never to be settled. Soon enough, physical metamorphosis, duplication and injury abound; all matter is disrupted, as coﬀee switches from liquid to solid; lights ﬂash wildly.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;The problem with X-ray vision is that it takes for granted, but cannot explain, the constitution of a spatial continuum. The territory between a foreground and a background ﬁgure is an element of both separation and connection, the place where one passes into or onto the next.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Not for our purposes. Because they exist inside our skulls, and that’s what counts. And only the least imaginative among us won’t feel them lurking in the shadows, just out of sight.&quot;[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America&#x27;s Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The total whiteness is an effacement, an obliteration—a neutral element, like a road leading to a place of rest. It is as if one were in a cavern, hidden away, a place where one rediscovers one’s origins and roots.&quot;[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;In societies like ours, where architecture and history make meaning out of vast and shifting complexities, the primitive hut is a search and an attempt to pare away what is given and apparent, to find something else to satisfy our deepest emotions.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;modern building and historical memory History could be, and often is, seen as a phenomena of change, of epochs and associated styles succeeding one another in time.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
