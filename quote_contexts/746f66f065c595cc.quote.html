    <pre>Following this statement by Serres,the modern scientific attitude shifts from Ariadne’s thread to Penelope’s weaving: from an objective singular notion to an operative stance. In our case, now that the elements and projections of the WIPT editor are in place, this section turns to use: how writing interactively negotiates across the domains of the multi-modal cast in practice. Rather than a single deductive chain, interaction unfolds as a woven network of concurrent entries and crossings, more tapestry than thread, so that its cast is always oriented to the whole it approaches through successive correspondences.</pre>

      <li>&quot;In particular I will go back and reflect upon the notion of “interaction through textures” from a number of alternative perspectives and in relation to the topics of e. g. so called P3-systems, the issue of interacting vs. being in these new environments, public interaction rituals, conventions for interaction with and through interactive textures, and the texturing of interaction knowledge in the world.

<li>&quot;If just studying IT use from the outside this will be to a large extend invisible. It is therefore important to engage oneself in this world of layered intersections of interactions as to discover the inner character of IT use, i. e. interaction. Having introduced interaction as an act of, or perhaps the art of, creating meaningful intersections in between the human and the digital I now move on to theorize the concept of interaction even further as to address how digital objects and digitalized places are increasingly becoming part of our interaction rituals from the viewpoint of a model that first examine the notion of interaction in detail followed by an attempt to contextualize the notion of interaction in relation to the context in which interaction occur.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;We further pursue the concept in contemporary digital media, and examine its particular meaning within the fields of conversation analysis and human social interaction, in order to explore its potential application in computationally augmented spaces. In light of this discussion, we review contemporary interactive environments and installations, such as ADA and Performative Ecologies, in order to evaluate their interactive capacities.&quot;[Yiannoudes, Socrates *Architecture and Adaptation: From Cybernetics to Tangible Computing*. Routledge, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;The acting out of interaction in public space is challenging and in this chapter I also address this challenge in relation to the notion of conventions and how we might work with conventions for interaction design focusing on interaction with and through interactive textures. Following this line of reasoning, this chapter continues with a discussion on the embedding of “interaction knowledge” in the world. The chapter ends with a theoretical take on interaction and textures and in doing that I propose the “IT (Interaction through Textures)-framework” as a conceptual frame for thinking about the intertwining of the physical and computational, and how we might interactive with and through these new computational resources and elements of our everyday world.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

<li>&quot;I argue in the following section that the notion of a semantic clash cannot serve to define what is interpreted metaphorically. I argue that the realm of metaphorical interpretation, understood as an act of productive imagination in the way Ricoeur does, is not constituted by properties of discourse. The claim that what is recognizable as a metaphor acquires a productive interpretation, and thus involves a different type of meaning therewith becomes circular, for if the metaphorical is defined by its interpretation alone, it will indeed have a acquired a metaphorical interpretation.&quot;[Brouwer, Elisabeth Cathérine *Imagining Metaphors: Cognitive Representation in Interpretation and Understanding*. Institute for Logic, Language and Computation Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Derrida suggested that a cultural construction, such as an idea, a value, or a sentence can be disassembled, or taken apart, and decoded—its parts examined for “meaning. ” The parts can be reassembled into another whole that may, then, take on a different meaning. The rearrangement of the parts into various wholes opens a way of exploring the complex nature of signs and moves communications into the complicated landscape of multimeaning, layered contexts, thus marking a shift from binary, yes–no signification to a more subjective, multidimensional interpretation of meaning.&quot;[Heller, Steven *Design Literacy: Understanding Graphic Design*. 2nd. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;This is aligned to the idea of interactivity as a cooperative process involving user participation, which was examined in Chapter 4. Instead of defining interactive architecture using insights from architectural examples and publications only, we looked deeper into the emergence of the concept of interactivity in the postwar cybernetic discourse, which led to contemporary notions of interactivity in the context of the new digital media and human–computer interaction.&quot;[Yiannoudes, Socrates *Architecture and Adaptation: From Cybernetics to Tangible Computing*. Routledge, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Let us develop this new dialectic: the objectiﬁcation of meaning is a necessary mediation between the writer and the reader. But as mediation, it calls for a complementary act of a more existential character which I shall call the appropriation of meaning. ‘Appropriation’ is my translation of the German term Aneignung. Aneignen means ‘to make one’s own’ what was initially ‘alien’.&quot;[Ricoeur, Paul, and John B. Thompson *Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences: Essays on Language, Action and Interpretation*. Reissue. Cambridge University Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Finally, I could not have written this book without the support and encouragement of Mark Jooren. Without him, and without our son Raf, finishing it would not be half the fun it is. v vi Overview In Chapter 1 I consider the problem that poetic text poses to theories of linguistic meaning. Interpretation of poetic text involves subjective representations of meaning, that are considered normally to lie outside the scope of a truth conditional semantics, or semantic theories on propositional meaning; hence, the scarce occasions where poetic text is mentioned in semantic theory, usually exclude it from the realm of semantic interpretation.&quot;[Brouwer, Elisabeth Cathérine *Imagining Metaphors: Cognitive Representation in Interpretation and Understanding*. Institute for Logic, Language and Computation Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Let us recall the initial paradox of event and meaning: discourse, we said, is realised as event but understood as meaning. How does the notion of work ﬁt into this paradox?By introducing the categories of production and labour into the dimension of discourse, the notion of work appears as a practical mediation between the irrationality of the event and the rationality of meaning. The event is stylisation itself, but this stylisation is in dialectical relation with a complex, concrete situation presenting conﬂictual tendencies.&quot;[Ricoeur, Paul, and John B. Thompson *Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences: Essays on Language, Action and Interpretation*. Reissue. Cambridge University Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Discourse has an eventful character, insofar as to speak is to realise an event which immediately disappears. Yet although the utterance of a sentence is an ephemeral phenomenon, nevertheless a sentence may be reidentiﬁed as the same on subsequent occasions; in other words, ‘if all discourse is realised as an event, all discourse is understood as meaning’. 17 Ricoeur suggests that, on ﬁrst approximation, the notion of meaning may be analysed into two basic dimensions, comprising both an objective aspect or that which the sentence means, and a subjective aspect or that which the speaker means.&quot;[Ricoeur, Paul, and John B. Thompson *Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences: Essays on Language, Action and Interpretation*. Reissue. Cambridge University Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;One aspect of poetic interpretation concerns an allegorical, or metaphorical understanding of the text. Since the semantic literature on metaphorical interpretation is abundant, I at first restrain the topic of poetic interpretation to the metaphorical interpretation of poetic text, and consider to what extent theories on metaphor help explain it. I consider first semantic perspectives, and then cognitive perspectives on metaphor. Throughout the discussion of different theories, I focus on possible implications for the metaphorical interpretation of poetic text.&quot;[Brouwer, Elisabeth Cathérine *Imagining Metaphors: Cognitive Representation in Interpretation and Understanding*. Institute for Logic, Language and Computation Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;In some instances, “nonhumans” (even beings without brains) emerge as partaking in the world’s active engagement in practices of knowing. 43 Barad’s radical ontological conclusion is thus that “matter and meaning are mutually articulated”:44 “Discursive practices are the material conditions for making meaning. In my posthumanist account, meaning is not a human-based notion; rather, meaning is an ongoing performance of the world in its differential intelligibility. ”45 She mentions a primitive, brainless deep-sea organism whose entire surface mirrors light changes and triggers an escape motion when these changes are read as dangerous—an example of the mutual articulation of meaning and matter.&quot;[Žižek, Slavoj *Less than nothing: Hegel and the shadow of dialectical materialism*. Verso, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, in order to explore interaction in the context of architectural space and the nuances of this development, we need to proceed to the examination of the social aspects of interactivity, i. e. human–machine interaction in the complex social framework of daily activity. As we shall see, sociological and ethnographic accounts of interaction in systems of practice within which computational applications are embedded, suggest alternatives to traditional notions of interactivity. 31 Situated and Conversational Interaction Interaction, in the context of sociology and communication studies, draws on human face-to-face communication.&quot;[Yiannoudes, Socrates *Architecture and Adaptation: From Cybernetics to Tangible Computing*.
