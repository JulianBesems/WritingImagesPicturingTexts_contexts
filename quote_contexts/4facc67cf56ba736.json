However as mentioned the other direction from imagery to text will be explored in one of the experimental sub-chapters in chapter 4, although this will be done partially outside of the text editor. Therefore we will first present the active mediations that are implemented within the WIPT editor, and at the end of this chapter we will briefly showcase the nature of the inverse direction. Figure 3.6:1 - Screenshot of the text editor, showing the section of this chapter, with the config buttons at the top of the section, next to it are the thumbnails of dropped in pdfs, the dropdown menu for the image projection method at the bottom, targeting slider, and the editor window to the right. First a short note on the way in which the frontend of the editor is connected to the elements, screens and material explained above. The entire editor is interacted with through a web-interface, currently run on a localhost. Everything is written in the Markdown editing format, typed into a pop-up window, which in turn gets rendered as a formatted text in the main window. The main window is broken up into separate sections that can be selected to edit, generally meant to contain a chapter or subchapter per section, clicking the section loads the content markdown text into the editor pop-up window. Additionally the section has 3 buttons at the top: bookConfig, saveConfig and loadConfig, which are there to set up the input book references through which the books are selected that will make up the paragraph collection for that section. The input books are provided by simply dropping a pdf document onto the section. The combination of these dropped in pdf's constitutes a situated cast, a personalised perspective on the public corpus of text specific to the writing of that section. Once a configuration has been loaded, two moveable containers show up in the main window, one containing a red paragraph that is the top result from projecting the content being written at that moment onto the paragraphs of that section's books, the other contains a magenta paragraph which is the top result through the suggested paragraph based on the aforementioned writing. Clicking either opens another window containing the total list of 10-20 results depending on the configuration setting, which are also the alternative sentences that are visible when clicking one of the included red or magenta citations throughout this thesis. This projection of both suggestion and writing is initiated after typing stops for 2 seconds. The writer engages in a constantly present back and forth with the editor as it replies in a situated context.\n\n*As the writer navigates this web-based interface, the editor's responses are constantly updated, allowing for a seamless integration of writing and feedback. The editor's situated context is further reinforced by the ability to select and load different books, which not only provide a rich source of paragraphs but also serve as a backdrop for the writer's creative process. The interaction between the writer and the editor becomes a dynamic dance, with the editor's suggestions and the writer's input constantly informing and refining the writing process. As we explore this interactive environment in more detail, it is essential to recognize the crucial role that the WIPT editor plays in facilitating this creative dialogue.
