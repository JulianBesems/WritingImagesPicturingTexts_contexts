The profession has excelled at the first (the tangible model and its deliverables), while the second (abstraction as mediating intelligence) remains under-instrumentalised in computational practice. The challenge, then, is not to abandon the body of architecture but to recover its disembodied capacities as operations that relate unlike domains such as drawing, narrative, atmosphere, code, without collapsing them into sameness. Therefore the thinking of architectural modes of media is proposed to be brought into the computational before we can consider it being returned onto architecture itself."}
