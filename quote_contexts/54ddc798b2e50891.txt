01. "*Once it becomes dig­ital, every form of knowledge does not simply stand but is always open to “digitability. ” To quote Calas- so, it turns into “[a]n encyclopedia that juxtapos­es impeccably reliable information with baseless information, equally accessible and on the same level. ”19* [Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7EH52CZI?page=29&annotation=JQZGYELJ)"

02. "*Under the guise of reverting to a previous arrangement, it recovers its three functions-but in order to pervert them, there­ by disturbing all the traditional bonds oflanguage and the image.* — **This exactly expresses how text and image cannot in all situations be expressed in the same encoding. Because this subversion is only possible because image and text stand to each others proportion but not in one another's encoding.** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=34&annotation=SDLNYAT5)"

03. "*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&annotation=WA8NIH6S)"

04. "*An Informational Instrument celebrates these contradictions without having an explicit a priori base unit. It opens a different perspective. What if the emphasis is not on measuring reality but on encoding and decoding it in many ways, by crafting different keys to access the world in many ways? What if it is about articulating faces and mixing libraries? It is a different game then. You are not looking for specific properties to measure, but are trying to develop a communication channel through which you can articulate profiles of different encodings. This is the search for the most general and abstract ingredients in a given situation. There is no base unit of a book. Yet, in a Plentiful Play books are profiling libraries from many perspectives simultaneously. A book becomes a constitutive part of a character of an alphabet that articulates its library—a symbolic void element* — **Interesting to relate to groups, rings, and bodies** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=308&annotation=4WBUS9PP)"

05. "*n other words, in language there are many specimens of each sentence, each clause, each word, etc. These specimens he named variants, and the entities of which they are specimens, invariants. This specification is valid for functions too. What becomes important is how the invariants are recognised from variants, and a method that establishes the criteria for the reduction.* — **the level of the invariant depends on the established level of resolution/abstraction!** [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=185&annotation=C8ZGP2FW)"

06. "*In this respect, content and expression could be seen as two different domains giving form to each other. The process of formalisation could be seen as a form of communication.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=184&annotation=26A4N5IC)"

07. "*Each encoding opens a different spectrum of possible decodings. These encodings don’t define what a text is but provide the ground for a specific context and its articulations. The measurement becomes part of the encoding process. It translates into a cypher open to many articulations and, in effect, opens a communication channel.* [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=324&annotation=Q4HJ78JE)"

08. "*Lemke noted (2002: 303) ‘No [written] text is an image. No text or visual representation means in all and only the same ways that text can mean. It is this essential incommensurability that enables genuine new meanings to be made from the combinations of modalities’.* — **-this is exactly the right way of putting it compared to earlier sentence** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=272&annotation=KAHF5HK6)"

09. "*The process/system distinction can be represented more clearly from the standpoint of constants and variables. It becomes clear that the process determines the system, which in fact means that the existence of a system is a necessary condition for the existence of the process. Therefore, text cannot exist without a language laying behind it, but it is possible to have a language without a text constructed in that language. In that case, language is possible but textual process is virtual: it is possible but not actually realised. 687* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=170&annotation=7GBQHCMB)"

10. "*If language is always accessible as a formed substance (i. e. , text, speech, thoughts. . . ), then what can be said about the unformed substance? Hjelmslev noticed that whatever this substance might be, it would in any case be a factor which is common to all languages.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=174&annotation=P4YW7JF3)"
