An umbrella, seen through Studio Ghibli, becomes a Ghibli umbrella: an object with narrative, weight, and gesture. It means that a concept can stop being an abstract noun and start behaving like something with a particular weather, pacing, and atmosphere. The umbrella example is telling precisely because it is banal: once the umbrella passes through a cast of Ghibli films it ceases to be a generic token and becomes a specific one, a Ghibli umbrella,\n\n*The same process unfolds with the concept of 'city'.
