    <pre>3.3 ELEMENTALS Now that we&#x27;ve established the material we&#x27;ll be using, this chapter will discuss the ways in which the contents are resolved into their subsequent elements. These elements are what will act as the indices by which we will compute the projections and searches within and across the domains. We shall therefore here outline how these elements will act as symbolic representations for their domains, and how this representation is achieved through different ways of encoding the information. TEXT We will first discuss all elements from the text domain that will feature in WIPT. book Even though not all of the documents included in the text domain the 1.1M documents described in 3.2.1 would normally be referred to as books, we will use the term book to refer to any of the highest order documents in the text domain in order to avoid confusion further on with the documents in the multi-modal domains. The book as a full entity is in all instances treated purely as text as such. The processing of this from the original file format was discussed in 3.2.1. The next step is to make this full text &#x27;measurable&#x27; or in other words create a vectorisation for each book. First the text is pre-processed through filtering on only words, getting rid of all punctuation and capitalisation. Then stop-words are removed, words are lemmatised, and finally non-english words are removed, reducing the full book to a normalised list of terms. A short example of the preprocessing transformation applied to the red quote above: &#x27;see&#x27;, &#x27;begun&#x27;, &#x27;see&#x27;, &#x27;instability&#x27;, &#x27;meaning&#x27;, &#x27;uncertainty&#x27;, &#x27;reference&#x27;, &#x27;experiencing&#x27;, &#x27;first&#x27;, &#x27;hand&#x27;, &#x27;generally&#x27;, &#x27;termed&#x27;, &#x27;linguistic&#x27;, &#x27;indeterminacy&#x27;, &#x27;simply&#x27;, &#x27;function&#x27;, &#x27;expression&#x27;, &#x27;interpretation&#x27;, &#x27;well&#x27;, &#x27;arises&#x27;, &#x27;imperfection&#x27;, &#x27;medium&#x27;, &#x27;speaker&#x27;, &#x27;use&#x27;, &#x27;radical&#x27;, &#x27;subjectivity&#x27;, &#x27;listener&#x27;, &#x27;interpreter&#x27;, &#x27;reason&#x27;, &#x27;doubly&#x27;, &#x27;inescapable&#x27;, &#x27;condition&#x27;, &#x27;prevents&#x27;, &#x27;ever&#x27;, &#x27;arriving&#x27;, &#x27;certain&#x27;, &#x27;complete&#x27;, &#x27;understanding&#x27;, &#x27;human&#x27;, &#x27;affair&#x27; Applying this to all 1.1M books yields a total of 63029 unique terms, henceforth referred to as the 11mvocab . Based on the preprocessed terms, a TF-IDF matrix was built, having 63029 columns one per term and 1,100,990 rows one per document.

<em>These elements are then used as input to the vector space model, which enables us to perform various operations on the documents such as similarity searches and clustering. Furthermore, the elements serve as the foundation for the construction of the document-topic model, which we will discuss in the next section.</em></pre>

    <div class="selected">22 Words are acoustical signs for concepts; concepts, however, are more or less definite image signs for often recurring and associated sensations, for groups of sensations. To understand one another, it is not enough that one use the same words; one also has to use the same words for the same species of inner experiences; in the end one has to have one’s experience in common. Therefore the human beings of one people understand one another better than those belonging to different peoples even if they employ the same language; or rather when human beings have long lived together under similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, needs, and work), what results23 from this is people who “understand24 one another”—a people.[Nietzsche, Friedrich *Beyond Good &amp; Evil*.

      <li>&quot;The computer read off the mass of a particle along one axis, its lifetime along another, and the g-factor along a third, all colour-coded according to the various quantum numbers possessed by the particle in question - charge, spin, parity, etc. &#x27;And one of the crucial features Ng-Robinson introduced is a key intensity factor which indicates the probability of the detection being a reliable one. A very sharp bright image indicates firm identification of a particle, while a fuzzy one implies there may be some considerable uncertainty as to the suggested identification of an actual particle.&quot;[Aldiss, Brian W., and Roger Penrose *White Mars*. 2000.]</li>
<li>&quot;As part of the five-year research program, the scholars examined computer logs documenting the behavior of visitors to two popular research sites, one operated by the British Library and one by a U. K. educational consortium, that provide access to journal articles, e-books, and other sources of written information. They found that people using the sites exhibited “a form of skimming activity,” hopping from one source to another and rarely returning to any source they’d already visited.&quot;[Cohen, Samuel *50 Essays: A Portable Anthology*. 5th ed. Bedford / St. Martin’s, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is easy to show examples. The points of the X-axis whose abscissae are 0 or positive can be put into one-to-one correspondence with those whose abscissae are greater than or equal to any chosen positive number. Or again, if we take the two ordered sequences 1, 2, o, 4, ,,. , Ι2, 22, 32, 42, . . . there is a one-to-one correspondence between them, but the second sequence contains only a minor portion of the first. Here Bolzano stands on the brink of taking a great forward step, that of describing the Machtigkeit or power of an infinite assemblage, and showing that not all infinite assemblages are equivalent in the sense that they can be put in one-to-one correspondence with one another.&quot;[Coolidge, Julian Lowell, and Jeremy Gray *The mathematics of great amateurs*. 2nd ed. Oxford :, New York: Clarendon Press; Oxford University Press, 1990.]</li>

<li>&quot;One should not hesitate to ask his teacher questions, though they may seem simple or silly. In English, it is said that there are five friends of a person – the four Ws and one H, namely, What, When, Why, Where and How. If one makes use of these friends, he can learn everything about a topic. The next step will be to listen carefully to what the teacher says. One should be attentive and listen. One should analyse, recollect frequently and remember the facts. Sanskrit has three terms for this: shravana (hearing), mañana (thinking), and nidhidhyasana (constant musing).&quot;[Suhas, B. R. *Immortal Sayings: From Indian Scriptures and Classics*. V&amp;S Publishers, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Probably you are inferring something about how the image was constructed. You have guessed—correctly—that I made the image using software. At some level, the lines of the cow cartoon are defined, mathematically, as curves. At that level, there is just one cow, a purely formal one. My software allows one abstract entity to participate in a recurring but varied series of particular, sensible manifestations. To look at these three cows and see only one is not a case of overlooking real differences, slurring similarity into identity.&quot;[Holbo, John, and Belle Waring *Reason &amp; Persuasion: Three Dialogues by Plato: Euthyphro, Meno, Republic, Book 1*. 3rd ed.

<li>&quot;Assume at least four subordinate tracks, one sustaining dis attended events, one directional, one overlaid communication, and one matters for concealment. Second, the laminations. The strip under question presumably CONCLUSIONS 565 has none. Neither a keying is present nor a deception. Certainly such straightforwardness is possible. But one should see that it is not likely for a very long period of time. And often effort will have had to be exerted to ensure even this. The absence of laminations is to be seen, then, as something worth seeing.&quot;[Goffman, Erving *Frame Analysis. An Essay on the Organization of Experience*.
