This raises the question of how to account for the model's own situatedness and partiality in its encoding of the world. In other words, how can we reconcile the model's objective claims to represent the world with its own subjective and partial nature?", "suggest_context": "2.5 ARCHITECTONIC OBSTACLE The use of machine learning to encode the objects of domains entails that the model is embedded within the domain as much as the objects it encodes. Encoding is therefore never simply the extraction of properties from the thing itself, but the production of differences through a particular apparatus of discernment. In Hegels Observing Reason the topic of Differentiae corresponds to relevant questions as to how we shall relate to the ordered sets of information that are curated by machine learning and the encoding of these objects into vectors as to distinguish them from each other. The \"features\", as the dimensions of these vectors are often referred to, behave in similar fashion to the differentiae, in that they certainly have an essential connection to the object it encodes, however they are as much and possibly to a larger extent a characteristic of the model which makes this encoding: its training, priors, and operative constraints. In accordance as to how the differentiae are essentially connected to the cognition which discerns them. The obstacle is therefore not only that domains differ, but that the very means by which they are made comparable is itself situated and partial."}
