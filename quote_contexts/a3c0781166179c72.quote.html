    <pre>4.1.2 WALL

<em>The wall, a sturdy barrier, stood tall and proud, its rough stones bearing the scars of countless battles. The once-vibrant colors of the city&#x27;s flags now faded, like the memories of its people. The silence was oppressive, heavy with the weight of forgotten dreams.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;The very majesty of its physical statement betrayed the vulnerability of the city to attacks from the barbarian onslaughts of the half century before its erection (Figures 1. 1 and 1. 2). Rome was also economically and politically distressed as well. The wall stretched around the city for twelve miles with 381 towers and numerous gates. 5 The empire had shifted from the offensive to the defensive; Aurelian may have hastened the wall’s erection because he feared an imminent incursion. 6 The curtain walls were thicker and more massive than anything seen before, and its towers – usually sited about 100 feet (33m) apart – were designed to project forward.&quot;[Klingelhofer, Eric C *First forts : essays on the archaeology of proto-colonial fortifications*.

<li>&quot;The wall’s function of spatial separation was a key element in the foundation of a city, as seen in the symbolic ploughing of the pomerium boundary. The first emperor of Rome, Augustus, struck coins showing the emperor ploughing a furrow in just such a symbolic act. The wall was a physical reminder of the city’s longevity, success, and genesis. It defined the municipal territory for its citizenry and marked what for the ancients was a dangerous place, 7 Ibid.&quot;[Klingelhofer, Eric C *First forts : essays on the archaeology of proto-colonial fortifications*.

<li>&quot;This problem may be linked in part with another which involves the tracing of what should have been the front or northern wall of the Castillo. From the wall marked c in ﬁgure 9 to the fragment of buried wall at d there is a steep slope now covered by vegetation and by large and small blocks of fallen stone. There are a few remnants of walls, such as that indicated at c, but none of these are of the size or thickness which might indicate that they formed extensions of the main outer wall.&quot;[McCown, Theodore D. *Pre-Incaic Huamachuco: Survey and excavations in the region of Huamachuco and Cajabamba*.

<li>&quot;The city had gotten its wished-for landmark. All these prestigious organizations attempted to describe the building that resulted from Turnbull&#x27;s design. The architect, himself, spoke of the metaphor of the garden wall. Where do people want to read?By the window in the sunshine. It needed intimate scale, a garden outlook, light. In the city you make a garden with a wall around it.&quot;[Hagloch, Susan B. *Library building projects: tips for survival*. Libraries Unlimited, 1994.]</li>

<li>&quot;It is enclosed all around by a great wall forming a square, each side of which is a mile in length. The great wall has five gates on its southern face. Inside of this wall there is a second, enclosing a space that is somewhat greater in length than in breadth.

<li>&quot;The semicircular feature in particular is highly significant as it is doubtless the base of an externallyprojecting wall tower. To the east of the old mosque, a large portion of a thick, but heavily eroded wall stands several metres high. This seems to align with the wall remains at the south-west end of the old mosque and it is joined to another similar high wall which is oriented north–south.&quot;[Bagnall, Roger S., Paola Davoli, and Colin A.

<li>&quot;Article 22. Any man that takes, or has already taken, possession of someone else’s wall,57 and a year goes by, and there are no claims against it, and then the owner of the wall says and swears that he did not know or see the other man take possession of his wall, and the Mayor orders that he relinquish the wall, and in the event two years went by, or longer, the owner must never lose his property, as long as nobody demonstrates that the owner of the wall was not in the city.&quot;[(auth.), Besim S.

<li>&quot;For centuries, waste matter was thrown over the historic wall east of Darb Al-Ahmar, eventually submerging the wall and piling into a veritable mountain. An impressive 1300-m stretch of the Ayubbid wall has been excavated, and the Darb Al-Ahmar buildings flanking it have been spruced up to give a much-needed boost to a poor and deprived neighbour-hood.&quot;[Betts, Vanessa *Cairo &amp; Nile Delta.

<li>&quot;The actual windows in the inner skin are not aligned with the five empty window openings in the outer wall.

<li>&quot;Obviously the intention was to create the effect of vistas through the wall, such as later appeared in wall paintings of the Second Pompeian Style. The entrance to the kline chamber reflects the same concept. In this case, the wall is decorated with a small tetrastyle Ionic temple facade supporting a low pediment; this scheme recalls the facades of Macedonian tombs.&quot;[Fedak, Janos *Monumental Tombs of the Hellenistic Age: A Study of Selected Tombs from the Pre-Classical to the Early Imperial Era*.

<li>&quot;Here the frieze marks the break between the decoration of the walls – imitation stone facings, above which is a shallower zone of pediments and masonry – and the large, framed figure panels above, on the upper wall and vaulted ceiling. Vine and Acanthus: decorative themes in the wall-paintings of Kellis In their relative simplicity, the scroll- and-panel schemes in the temples at Kellis and Deir el-Hagar are far distant from both the Pompeian wall-paintings and the decoration with real or fictive stonework of opulent interior spaces in late imperial Rome.&quot;[Bagnall, Roger S., Paola Davoli, and Colin A.

<li>&quot;The shops and markets well provided. The Emperor’s palace is in the center of the city, where the two great streets meet.
