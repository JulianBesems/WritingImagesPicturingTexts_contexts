<em>I move through a labyrinth of sentences, each one a door that swings open to reveal a new paragraph, a new idea, a new self. The words swirl around me like a vortex, drawing me in with their promise of meaning and connection. I am no longer lost in the void, but navigating a world that is both familiar and strange.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;His doorway distinguishes between a zone of light and a zone of shadow and identifies a place for me: o cross from one into the other. In doing so t evokes the idea of ‘another place’ or’ place beyond’ and suggests that I might aspire to; cross through, from here to there.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The name of the gateway is written above it: “Moment”. ’ Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 1883. trans. Hollingdale) Informal Occupation of Doorways Like the old man in Borges’s story, and notwithstanding Mongolian superstitions, we all find ourselves at one time or another occupying a doorway, on the step between one place and another.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Like the doorway in the beach place (p. 15) it provides the line of division with a specific threshold or crossing point. And fourth, whilst evoking a barrier that I might otherwise not have noticed, the doorway also tacitly invites me to step through it.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is not just a different place, but a place that no longer exists at all. Our primitive psyches were not wired for that knowledge. Where once existed a familiar home, favorite shop, or longtime office, a place whose microcosm of geography we could easily and comfortably navigate (it’s out the door, down the hall, on the left. . . ), now there is a void.&quot;[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America&#x27;s Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;We identify ourselves with this space, this place, this moment and these dimensions become ingredients of our very existence. Architecture is the art of reconciliation between ourselves and the world, and this mediation takes place through the senses.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>

<li>&quot;“The delicacy of the plaster adds a certain fragility to the whole organic, serpent-structure; like an unwound ribbon, it lies in folds. For me, it evokes temptation and mystery—a halfway point between intrigue and well-being, and I would like to preserve the secret that surrounds its walls.&quot;[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.

<li>&quot;What emerges is a vision of reproductive failure, dysfunctional labor and manufacturing stasis. Eraserhead’s dream-like prologue forges an immediate connection between industrial apparatus and sexual reproduction.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Lynch’s American pastoral laces the myths of solitude with peril: the price to be paid, perhaps, for an unthinking embrace of nature. His vision 48 THE ARCHITECTURE OF DAVID LYNCH is perhaps best expressed by Bachelard: “We do not have to be long in the woods to experience the always rather anxious impression of ‘going deeper and deeper’ into a limitless world. ”82 If the forest oﬀers a sense of boundlessness, a world within a world, then Lynch extends this idea to social relations: the woods, in Twin Peaks, is where the most unbounded behavior can take place.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Hers is a well-tempered world where her different influences often merge, creating something entirely new. The feeling here is like being permanently on vacation, yet without breaking from real life.&quot;[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;New rhythms and new perspectives alternate between density and restraint, and the result is a space with a strong personality.&quot;[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;This hearth became a social place, a place of community and of rite and ritual. In Vitruvius’ account, this deliberate assembly of people prompted the invention of language (II. I. 1).&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
