Selected: Rather than using the metaphor of the project, I look at the metaphor of the matrix. The matrix contradicts the model of design thinking that starts with an abstract idea that is gradually implemented through an iterative process. This classical model dating back to Aristotle’s vision of architecture, does not account for the fact that design/conception and design/practice are bringing together materials in unexpected ways without necessarily following a defined plan. However, I find interesting to analyze how composition is a projective abductive practice.[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]

01. "Doing so means switching from a temporal, chronological, model of the design project to a spatial, topological, model of design and to look at how the expression “design space” can be interpreted as a “matrix”, as the French philosopher of design 4 Some pictures of famous artists’ studios can be found on this website: http://www. artistsandillustrators. co. uk/news/Buildings-Architecture/530/famous-artists-studios 5 See for instance, in Paris, http://www. lelieududesign. com/la-materiautheque-materio 6 Hockney (2006)."[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]

03. "By including art at the SIGGRAPH conference, the computer graphics community is acknowledging the signiﬁcance of artistic production (if not aesthetics) in their ﬁeld of computing. The presence of art at SIGGRAPH suggests a reciprocal relationship. Not only can interface design have an aesthetic dimension, but digital art can also be a form of interface Jay David Bolter and Diane Gromala 370 design. Digital artists experiment with digital technology, creating prototypes to explore various design possibilities, new ways in which the user can interact with the digital artifact."[Aesthetic Computing, Paul A.

04. "The fifth line gives a succinct viewpoint of the disciplines that are primarily concerned. Though a simplification of what different Fig. 2. 4 Overview interactive/reflective paradigms 40 Rheingold (2000). 42 2 From Interactive Design to Reflective Design disciplines bring into analysis and design, the framework highlights methodologies and concepts that are involved (Fig. 2. 4). 2. 5  esigning for Reflection: Two Use Cases in Distributed D Networks While the first three examples described completed artifacts and their critical standpoints, the following two examples focus on the design process and show how the plane of representation was crucial."[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]

05. "We must emphasize that transparency is not a bad aesthetic or design strategy. Problems arise only when transparency is regarded as the exclusive goal of interface design, because in such cases the design may ignore the need for the user to be critically aware of the interface itself. Digital art promotes such critical awareness, as do a range of new design strategies in MR. We conclude by returning to the two approaches to aesthetic computing: what we called the code view and the interface view."[Aesthetic Computing, Paul A. Fishwick, 2006]

13. "However, a drawback of generality is inefficiency. For applications that require only a small subset of the complete HW/SW interface functionality, a generic model imposes tremendous overhead that cost-sensitive applications cannot tolerate.

14. "Ideally, the design process would start with a set of software tasks communicating with a set of hardware subsystems. Because software components run on processors, the abstraction needed to describe the interconnection between the software and hardware components is totally different from the existing abstraction of wires between hardware components as well as the function call abstraction that describes the software."[, , 2005]
