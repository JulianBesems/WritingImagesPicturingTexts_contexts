In the text screen, two floating panels return nearby passages: red for content-based correspondences, magenta for speculative continuations. In the figurative screen, a constellation of images appears, arranged according to their blue figurative label indices. This colour scheme carries throughout the thesis: red marks the textual domain, blue stages the perpendicular image contexts. The result is that the abundance remains playable in the time of writing, not a search session before or after. Two boundaries guide how this accompaniment is read. First, the contexts surfaced are indexical; existing passages and images that the editor brings into proximity. Where machine generated information is involved magenta, it still serves as navigation, not as a substitute for the material. Second, while the computational setup supports the inverse directions image rightarrow image; image rightarrow text, the writing loop privileges text as the initiating gesture; the other directions are demonstrated separately and taken up later. Crucially, nothing here is neutral. The instrument is designed to keep a personal and intentionally biased stance operative. Against generic public screens, we work with authored private casts that tune what appears. In practice a curated set of books configures the textual context for a section, and a hand-picked corpus of multi-modal documents films or pdfs biases both textual and figurative indices. Public is generic, private is authored: projection becomes proportion, not translation. This bias is not a flaw but the architectonic move: a way to keep difference productive and yet legible. Because the instrument is both subject and medium, its role varies with the aims of each chapter. In chapters 1,2,3, and 5, the redmagenta quotes and blue images operate as context, sometimes commentary, sometimes extended argument, sometimes staged illustrations that forms the backdrop of the writing. We embrace this as ornament in a digital sense: a productive excess that thickens discourse, a calibrated plenty rather than a funnel to one result. The ornament becomes a playable excess that keeps this plenty near at hand, as a proportion of the writing to its contextual textual and figurative parts. In chapter 4. and in the preludes 0.1 and 0.2, the relation reverses: the editor's returns become the material itself, and the personal writing proceeds by merely embellishing or glueing those returns. Figure 3:1: Screenshot of the editor whilst writing this chapter. In 3.1 we establish the instruments stance and its theoretical framing within the thesis; 3.23.6 describe the build: domains and casts, elements and encodings, the screens that keep modalities apart, the projections that relate them, and the interactive loop that lets the editors replies stay coextensive with the act of writing. In short, this chapter is the hinge where the earlier theoretical posture takes operational form, and where that operation returns, quietly and constantly, to write the text it accompanies.\n\n*As the instrument takes shape, it orchestrates multiple passages, images, and gestures into a single, evolving composition. The textual context, now a curated set of books, shapes the narrative trajectory, while the figurative context, a hand-picked corpus of multi-modal documents, inflects the image indices. In this way, the instrument becomes a mediator between the writer's intentions and the resulting text, a catalyst that sparks new connections and relationships between the various elements. With each iteration, the editor's returns become increasingly integrated into the writing, as if the text itself were responding to the writer's queries and concerns.
