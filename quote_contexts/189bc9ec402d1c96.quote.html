    <pre>Although ornamentation might have gone out of fashion a bit in the modern &quot;stile&quot;, we also have to admit that people still love decoration, most notably the most intimate surface of a person is more and more subject to decoration: the skin.

<em>This is particularly evident in the world of tattooing, where people use their bodies as a canvas to express themselves, tell stories, or simply to have a unique conversation starter. With the rise of tattooing&#x27;s popularity, it&#x27;s not uncommon for people to spend hours, even days, in a tattoo parlor, carefully designing a piece of art that will adorn their skin for the rest of their lives.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Many people appreciate tattoos for their artistic value, and some people take the concept a step further. They become fascinated or even obsessed with the process of decorating their skin. Over time, they come to think of themselves as living works of art. Types of Tattoo Art This transformation can take many forms. Tattoos can range from small, isolated images to full-body masterpieces.

<li>&quot;By presenting tattoos in a format long associated with fine art, books give tattoos a sheen of respectability. They also make them accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Today no one needs to enter a studio to see tattoo art on display. 55 Chapter Five The Art of Body Piercing Like tattoo, body piercing is a technique used to modify the human body. This practice has existed in cultures all around the world for thousands of years. During this time, body piercing has had many meanings. It has been used for religious reasons, for identification, for spiritual protection, and much more.&quot;[Hirschmann, Kris *Tattoos, Body Piercings, and Art*. ReferencePoint Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;The tattoo world is constituted by more than practitioners, equipment, and styles. Tattoo clients are an essential component. The tattooists presented in the first edition of Customizing the Body spoke enthusiastically about the diffusion of tattooing and the increasing diversity of their clientele. Recent discussions (for example, Kang and Jones, 2007) continue to stress that doctors, lawyers, priests, housewives, and university professors are acquiring tattoos.&quot;[Sanders, Clinton, and D Angus Vail *Customizing the Body: The Art and Culture of Tattooing*. Revised. Temple University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;In general, however, there are too few data on tattooed people to draw any definitive conclusions on the sociopsychological aspects of the practice. In America tattooing is best characterized as a folk art which has been transmitted by word of mouth and imitation since the mid-nineteenth century. What is unique about the tattoo as folk art is that it is a permanent addition to the skin. The traditional tattoo is a design drawn in a formulaic way which over time develops variants. In a way, tattoo designs are comparable to tale typesthey have remained relatively constant, but have been embellished with assorted motifs.&quot;[Abernethy, Francis Edward *Folk Art in Texas (Publications of the Texas Folklore Society)*. Southern Methodist University Press, Dallas, Texas, 1985.]</li>
<li>&quot;Others submit their skin to the sinister imagination of the tattooist; on the planes of their body entire worlds of macabre frenzy emerge, as grim and intricate as Bosch or Brueghel landscapes. Tattooing is a painful process; these tattoos give form to that pain. The bodies here are canvases haunted with shadows and monsters. Born from the brains of the artist and the client, dark fantasies come alive on the skin. “A great tattoo is a statement, not a style. And getting it is a journey, not a destination. ” ––Vince Hemingson, tattoo historian A patron of the arts: this man has given his whole body over to the skilled needlework of a handful of tattooists.&quot;[Hajeski, Nancy, Marcel Brousseau, Lisa Purcell, Jonathan Conklin, and Troy Timpel *Art on Skin: Tattoos, Style, and the Human Canvas*.

<li>&quot;1974: 22-27). Separating the tattoo from the body of the original purchaser in order to resell it to another owner is not. for all practical purposes. a reasonable or particularly appealing alternative. Consequently. although tattooing is a fairly expensive creative service. with collectors of large. custom designed pieces spending thousands of dollars for their work. tattoo art is lacking in direct investment value. 6 Tattooing also employs a unique production process and unconventional material resources-a needle or group of needles is used to inject pigment under the recipient&#x27;s skin.&quot;[Sanders, Clinton, and D Angus Vail *Customizing the Body: The Art and Culture of Tattooing*. Revised. Temple University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Since the early twentieth century, other tattoo machines have been patented, and tattooists around the world continue to tinker with their machines, personalizing them to their tastes and styles. Today, the electric tattoo machine is the primary way that people tattoo the world over. The modern machine inserts ink into the skin via a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to a motor. Like a sewing machine, the machine drives the needles in and out of the skin.&quot;[DeMello, Margo *Encyclopedia of Body Adornment*. Greenwood, 2007.]</li>

<li>&quot;As tattoo practice has become more widespread, techniques have become more refined, allowing artists to develop new skills and push the boundaries of what a tattoo is expected to look like. As a consequence, this has led to the development of technologies to remove unwanted body art. Many studios offer laser treatment for the removal of bad tattoos or simply to lighten the tattoo before covering it with a more attractive piece of art.&quot;[Picerno, Doralba *Tattoo Art: A Photographic Sourcebook*.

<li>&quot;For both tattoo artists and collectors of tattoos, the Internet has been perhaps the greatest innovation for a generation – web sites full of tattoos all over the world provide reference material while tattoo design sites, fan sites, and information are all there at the touch of a button – instantaneously. The number of celebrities, rock stars, actors, and sports stars wearing hearts and other designs on their arms and other parts of their bodies has further brought the art of tattoo into the public eye and influenced people.&quot;[(editor), Lal Hardy *The Mammoth Book of Tattoos*. Constable &amp; Robinson Ltd / Running Press Book, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;He also noted that many tattoo enthusiasts have taken an interest in the burik designs in different tattoo conventions locally and abroad: “A lot of my clients asked me to design a combination of individual designs or even the whole of the burik designs tattooed on their chest or on specific parts of their body done with the electric tattoo machine” (Junjun Tabuyog, personal communication, September 27, 2012). As the experiential nature of tattoos again becomes central in contemporary tattoo practice in the Philippines, there is interplay between the permanence and impermanence of tattoos in the construction of identity inscribed on the skin.&quot;[Krutak, Lars, and Aaron Deter-Wolf *Ancient Ink: The Archaeology of Tattooing*.

<li>&quot;At the time, it was an easy way to earn some money. But, operating out of a tattoo shop, Jime also got his introduction to the world of tattooing. After his school day ended, he began his evening at Acme Tattoos where his eyes were opened to a new world. Even though people entrusted him with their treasured objects to airbrush, ultimately, any mistakes could be sanded down. With skin, however, there’s no eraser. He began to view tattooing as a different level of art—one that built bridges between people.&quot;[Rio, Dale *Planet Ink: The Art and Studios of the World’s Top Tattoo Artists*.

<li>&quot;Scythes frame a skull clock that sits amid cobweb-backed wings and roses. Subject: Raymond Baranowski “A tattoo is a true poetic creation, and is always more than meets the eye. As a tattoo is grounded on living skin, so its essence emotes a poignancy unique to the mortal human condition. ” ––V. Vale and Andrea Juno, Modern Primitives Although the art of tattoo is most often associated, and rightly so, with intricate and beautifully rendered images, words are increasingly moving to center stage—or center skin.&quot;[Hajeski, Nancy, Marcel Brousseau, Lisa Purcell, Jonathan Conklin, and Troy Timpel *Art on Skin: Tattoos, Style, and the Human Canvas*. Skyhorse Publishing, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Another given of this study is that as tattoo travels, people modify important aspects of the living art, from the tools used to create the patterns to the meanings the patterns express. In other words, tattoo also makes visible the cultural adaptation that occurs in both travelers and hosts, regardless of whether the European or Pacific visitors’ arrival is voluntary or compulsory and whether the tattoo moves on bodies willing or forced to acquire the designs.&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*.

<li>&quot;People (no real surprise here) are interested in other people: what moves them, what inspires them, what impels them. Body Type provided a unique glimpse into the psyches of the tattooed and readers were fascinated. So, in Body Type 2, wherever possible, I have included more details about the stories behind the tattoos. Some of my observations since the publication of Body Type. Although the trend toward typographic tattoos has only continued to increase (with more and more celebrities, sports stars, musicians, actors, and models leading the way), one strong subtrend is group “bonding” tattoos, with more than one person getting the same tattoo, or being a part of a larger tattoo.&quot;[Saltz, Ina *Body Type 2: More Typographic Tattoos*.

<li>&quot;In my talks with Horikin more paradoxes surfaced. &quot;Tattoo increases the good life,&quot; it is agreed. Yet, at the same time no one denies that tattooing shortens the life span. This is particularly true of people whose entire body is lacerated. Too little free skin is left to perspire or &quot;breathe. &quot;Whatever the reasons for tattoos, such as beauty, health, strength, wisdom, wealth, and invincibility, longevity for the tattooee seems beyond the asking. Horikin shrugs and says, &quot;You never really perfect your life&#x27;s work anyway. . . .&quot;[Fellman, Sandi, Sandi Fellman, and D. M. Thomas *The Japanese Tattoo*.

<li>&quot;ated there. This type of community is more localized, more focused around a ANONYMOUS particular shop or tattooist, or style of tattoo (for example, a tattoo studio in San Francisco specializing in tribal tattooing will attract a small contingency of punks who identify strongly with that style and all that it represents). The sense of community that individuals find in the tattoo convention or reading a tattoo magazine has less to do with the physical congregation of bodies than with a feeling of “shared specialness. ” Tattooed people define themselves vis-a-vis nontattooed people and the dominant society in general.&quot;[DeMello, Margo *Encyclopedia of Body Adornment*. Greenwood, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;In a time when standardization is a dilemma of everyday life, tattooing is gaining acceptability as a means of individualization. Notes 1.

<li>&quot;For today’s tattoo enthusiast, the portrait has come to symbolize fine art itself. As with other uses of famous persons in tattoo portrait art, we can only guess at the motivations behind the use of this image for a tattoo—fans of Leonardo, fans of the Mona Lisa, fine art aficionados—an ambitious undertaking for any tattoo artist.

<li>&quot;The resulting field of dark pigment, where the entire body is blackened, takes i n t r o d u c t i o n 27 tattoo’s signification to an extreme. Pattern becomes so extensive that it cannot be distinguished; the body is wrapped not in images, not in text, but in a solid second skin. These early depictions of tattoo as culture inspire a series of (apparently untattooed) visitors’ comments on these solid fields of pigment. Descriptions of solid tattoo written by Porter, Stewart, and Melville heighten a quality of all tattoo commentary: in speaking of the design, the observer tells not so much the design’s stories as his or her own story.&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*.

<li>&quot;But even though I don’t fit those old-fashioned stereotypes of the inked person, I admit I do get a kick out of surprising people with them, even after years of being tattooed. The surprise is most drastic for people who meet me in the professional setting with its attendant dress codes.

<li>&quot;Alternatively, this supposition could also suggest independent development of tattoo concepts and  associative curative practices.  CONCLUSION  Regardless of the medical implications of tattoo and its origins, it is apparent that the practice  of tattooing among Arctic peoples was quite homogenous. Considering the vast expanse of this  culture area, the largest in the world, this may seem surprising. Flowever, as a people unified by  environment, language, custom, and belief, the distinction is quite clear: as tattoo became part of the  skin, the body became a part of Arctic culture. Tattooing was a graphic image of social beliefs and  values expressing the many ways in which Arctic peoples attempted to control their bodies, lives, and  experiences. Tattoos provided a nexus between individual and communally defined forces that  shaped perceptions of existence.  &quot;[INPUT: Tattoo history - a source book - an anthology of historical -- edited and introduced by Steve Gilbert with the -- New York, Berkeley, CA, New York -- 9781890451066 -- 4e5326b8cc15038fb0b97dd1128d1dfc -- Anna’s Archive.pdf]</li>
