    <pre>3.2 DOMAINS Domains in this context are the fields of information between which the projections take place, as well as those that establish said projections. In the architectural communication, domains could be understood as the ichnographic,

<em>the geometric, and the constructive, among others. These domains are interconnected, forming a complex network that allows for the exchange of information between them. This is achieved through the use of common languages and formats, which facilitate communication and collaboration among the different disciplines involved in the architectural project.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;These efforts have seen some fruition in deployment, particularly with the respect to the interchange of CAD/design data [3]. A natural application of standards for semantic integration is supporting information exchange between applications across project phases – from early design through construction execution and ultimately supporting operations. Such integration among applications can support rapid testing and feedback from all parties during design (e. g. , circle integration [4]). The current view of such life-cycle approaches to information is Building Information Modeling (BIM) [5], which envisions all parties sharing data seamlessly across the life of the project.&quot;[Smith, Ian F.C. *Intelligent Computing in Engineering and Architecture: 13th EG-ICE Workshop 2006, Ascona, Switzerland, June 25-30, 2006, Revised Selected Papers*.

<li>&quot;Other efforts in semantic interoperability support particular processes within engineering practice such as functional design knowledge [4] or infrastructure management based on finding semantic agreements [5]. In summary, there is a need to create a framework in which dissimilar construction participants are able to exchange, share, transfer, and integrate information in order to fulfill collaboration goals. This approach aims to reach common knowledge by using explicit ontologies through the Semantic web at semantic and syntactic levels.&quot;[Smith, Ian F.C. *Intelligent Computing in Engineering and Architecture: 13th EG-ICE Workshop 2006, Ascona, Switzerland, June 25-30, 2006, Revised Selected Papers*.

<li>&quot;Collaborative work subsumes some kind of distributed processing environment (client-server, peer-to-peer, grid) in which information is exchanged or shared. In the model-based paradigm the basis for successful exchange/sharing of information is provided by Building Information Models (BIM). Therefore, we first provide a brief overview of the different types of models that are needed and have to be dealt with and then present the suggested interrelated methods for tackling the model consistency problems.&quot;[Smith, Ian F.C. *Intelligent Computing in Engineering and Architecture: 13th EG-ICE Workshop 2006, Ascona, Switzerland, June 25-30, 2006, Revised Selected Papers*.

<li>&quot;A Physical Language of Objects to Support Collaborative Participation The development of a common language of objects is considered central to the construction of “meaning” through the interactivity with the tabletop games and simulations in the physical media tools.&quot;[Arias, Ernesto G., Hal Eden, and Gerhard Fischer *Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory*.

<li>&quot;227 Building Information Modelling Information Models in Contemporary Design Practice According to the US National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), BIM refers to ‘the use of the concepts and practices of open and interoperable information exchanges, emerging technologies, new business structures and influencing the re-engineering of processes in ways that dramatically reduce multiple forms of waste in the building industry’. 1 The institute’s work focuses mainly on the further development of integrated product delivery (IPD) and data translation for the streamlined sharing of information between architects and subcontractors, such as structural steel fabricators.&quot;[Carpo, Mario *The digital turn in architecture 1990-2010*.

<li>&quot;The system is similar to BIM model, but its scope of information is larger. 4 APPLICATION IN ARCHITECTURE DESIGN Similar to a CIM system, the key challenge of CAII is process control based on information integration. In this section we explain how to link the theory to application by raising questions and presenting a prototype of implementation process from a practical project. 4. 1 Case explanation BIM is a typical example of information-based application, as BIM models are created parametrically.&quot;[da Silva, Fernando Moreira, Helena Maria Bártolo, Paulo Bártolo, Rita Almendra, Filipa Roseta, Henrique Amorim Almeida, and Ana Cristina Lemos *Challenges for technology innovation : an agenda for the future : proceedings of the International Conference on Sustainable Smart Manufacturing (S2M 2016), October 20-22, 2016, Lisbon, Portugal*.

<li>&quot;Most existing 3D applications in the field of operational policy-making, for example for urban lay-outs or infrastructural constructs give very precise information about projects. They show highly detailed designs at well defined locations and are Linking Land Use Modelling and 3D Visualisation 87 often meant for giving information on short term changes. The output of land use models, in favour of strategic planning, however consists usually of rather coarse grid cells and it concerns the long term.&quot;[Van Leeuwen, Jos P., and Harry J.P. Timmermans *Innovations in Design &amp; Decision Support Systems in Architecture and Urban Planning*. Springer, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The information and knowledge associated with the decision making in these processes is both tacit and distributed among the different stakeholders in the problem or conflict space. These basic concerns led to the initial development of the tabletop simulations and games to support decision-making in planning and design (Arias et al. , 1997a). Language-Based Simulations and Games: Supporting Planning and Design DecisionMaking For the decision games and simulations developed in the context of the CoPlan paradigm the concept of “winning or loosing” found in competition games does not exist.&quot;[Arias, Ernesto G., Hal Eden, and Gerhard Fischer *Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory*.

Yet the most important one is the ‘Information System’. 3. 2 Information Face Tough Face Tough Face Tough Face Tough Face Tough Face Tough Face Tough Face Tough Face Tough Face Face Tough Tough Integrated information Development of expression form of architectural information can be defined according to Bill Mitchell: “Buildings were once materialized drawings, but now, increasingly they are materialized digital information—designed with the help of computer-aided design systems, fabricated by means of digitally controlled machinery, put together on site with the help of digital lay-out and positioning devices, and generally inseparable from the flows of information through computer networks” (Mitchell, 2005).&quot;[da Silva, Fernando Moreira, Helena Maria Bártolo, Paulo Bártolo, Rita Almendra, Filipa Roseta, Henrique Amorim Almeida, and Ana Cristina Lemos *Challenges for technology innovation : an agenda for the future : proceedings of the International Conference on Sustainable Smart Manufacturing (S2M 2016), October 20-22, 2016, Lisbon, Portugal*.

<li>&quot;In this view, the design process builds information into the structure of the molecule. But this view would not make sense if we understood the molecule to be simply a discrete and bounded entity. For if molecules were simply discrete entities, how could one then distinguish between a molecule which embodies little information and the ‘same’ molecule with the same structure of elements that embodies a great deal of information?In Whitehead’s and Stengers’s terms it is possible to give a different and more precise meaning to the idea of a material object being rich in information.&quot;[Fraser, Mariam, Sarah Kember, and Celia Lury *Inventive Life: Approaches to the New Vitalism*.

<li>&quot;Primarily led by architecture design department, the team structure is welldefined. Besides these, our team found a relative independent group whose members come from each department. This group mainly focus in building information modeling and 3D presentation. It deals with project information and strengthens the connection of different groups. Members are able to exchange their information smoothly. The team leader-the vice president is able to coordinate each department during the design processing.&quot;[da Silva, Fernando Moreira, Helena Maria Bártolo, Paulo Bártolo, Rita Almendra, Filipa Roseta, Henrique Amorim Almeida, and Ana Cristina Lemos *Challenges for technology innovation : an agenda for the future : proceedings of the International Conference on Sustainable Smart Manufacturing (S2M 2016), October 20-22, 2016, Lisbon, Portugal*.

<li>&quot;the theoretical work on information architectures and information spaces by Benyon (2004) of particular interest. According to Benyon’s model on information architectures and design of information spaces (2004) we can, given one basic set of information (e. g. hours, minutes and seconds) in many cases represent this in several different ways (the typical analogue clock vs. a typical digital clock is a good example of this difference). This is also true when it comes to the relation between materials and textures.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.
