    <pre>Given the simple condition that a text editor is bound by text, and that a thesis which is the testing ground for this multi-modal cast is primarily expected within this domain as well, the primary focus of the interaction is mediated by the writing I am presenting here. However as mentioned the other direction from imagery to text will be explored in one of the experimental sub-chapters in chapter 4, although this will be done partially outside of the text editor. Therefore we will first present the active mediations that are implemented within the WIPT editor, and at the end of this chapter we will briefly showcase the nature of the inverse direction.</pre>

      <li>&quot;This example with the clock is on the one hand a good example that illustrates the texturation approach as presented in this book. One the other hand, it is also a good example of how this complementary approach that integrates interaction design thinking with a perspective rooted in architecture as presented in this book can be of practical help for analyzing and understanding technology integration in context. This relate to a set of important messages in this book.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

<li>&quot;It is now time to summarize the lessons learned from the first chapter of the book. From my perspective the main purpose with this chapter was to establish a conceptual platform for one of the core concepts for this book, i. e. “interaction”. Since interaction is one critical concept, not only for this book, but for this emergent field of interactive architecture and the texturing of information technologies into our built environments it has been somewhat crucial to pay some extra attention to this concept.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;One aspect of poetic interpretation concerns an allegorical, or metaphorical understanding of the text. Since the semantic literature on metaphorical interpretation is abundant, I at first restrain the topic of poetic interpretation to the metaphorical interpretation of poetic text, and consider to what extent theories on metaphor help explain it. I consider first semantic perspectives, and then cognitive perspectives on metaphor. Throughout the discussion of different theories, I focus on possible implications for the metaphorical interpretation of poetic text.&quot;[Brouwer, Elisabeth Cathérine *Imagining Metaphors: Cognitive Representation in Interpretation and Understanding*. Institute for Logic, Language and Computation Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;As is well known, structural principles were ﬁrst applied with the greatest success to phonology, and then to lexical semantics and to syntactic rules. The structural analysis of the narrative may be regarded as one attempt to extend or transpose this model of linguistic entities beyond the 7 Cf. Roland Barthes, ‘Introduction à l’analyse structurale du récit’, Communications, 8 (1966), pp. 1–27 [English translation: ‘Introduction to the structural analysis of narratives’, in Image-Music-Text, edited and translated by Stephen Heath (London: Fontana/Collins, 1977), pp.&quot;[Ricoeur, Paul, and John B. Thompson *Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences: Essays on Language, Action and Interpretation*. Reissue. Cambridge University Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;The poetic nature of a text is then not so much a property of the text drawing attention to itself, but rather, depends on contextual presentation, and on the social convention that some formal aspects of a text should draw the interpreter&#x27;s attention to the text in itself. Thus, to recognize a text as being part of a poetic context allows a reader to approach the text as one of which the value has been established previously, and thus presents a &#x27;normal&#x27; context for poetic interpretation. 4 The realm of imagination The feature of objective disinterestedness in aesthetic judgement, we saw, is echoed in Jakobson&#x27;s notion of the poetic function, which draws the reader&#x27;s attention to the purely formal qualities of the poetic message, and leads him to disregard the referential or objective function of the text.&quot;[Brouwer, Elisabeth Cathérine *Imagining Metaphors: Cognitive Representation in Interpretation and Understanding*. Institute for Logic, Language and Computation Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;In this case, the context of interpretation is not a conceptual network pertaining to general knowledge about roses, or to specific perceptual experience of these, but rather, is derived from textual information about the phrase. Such information could comprise knowledge about its author, her other work, or the contextual presentation (a child&#x27;s book), as well as still further knowledge about poetry and general conventions therein.&quot;[Brouwer, Elisabeth Cathérine *Imagining Metaphors: Cognitive Representation in Interpretation and Understanding*. Institute for Logic, Language and Computation Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Uncertainty leads to greater variability in user input, even for the same user, thus increasing the technical challenges. To provide a satisfying user experience, a multimodal interface has to conform to users’ mental models and meet their expectations about the interaction and the domain. Ideally, an IV system should be easy to use and not require sophisticated user skills, as many are not computer experts.&quot;[Zudilova-Seinstra, Elena, Tony Adriaansen, Robert van Liere (auth.), Robert Liere, Tony Adriaansen, and Elena Zudilova-Seinstra (eds.) *Trends in Interactive Visualization: State-of-the-Art Survey*.

<li>&quot;Sharp et al. [29] suggest that recognising and understanding the trade-off between usability and user experience goals is important, particularly as this awareness enables designers to understand the consequences of pursuing different combinations of them in relation to fulfilling different user’s needs. Arguably, in order for any interactive visualisation UI to gain user acceptance it must meet both usability and user experience criteria for an enjoyable user experience. The usability and user experience criteria particularly relevant to interaction design in the literature [18, 20, 31, 35] were reviewed by the author.&quot;[Zudilova-Seinstra, Elena, Tony Adriaansen, Robert van Liere (auth.), Robert Liere, Tony Adriaansen, and Elena Zudilova-Seinstra (eds.) *Trends in Interactive Visualization: State-of-the-Art Survey*.

<li>&quot;As described above, the first part of the book has the title “Motivation: Think Outside the Box”. This first part of the book consists of the first three chapters in the book. As an ingres to this first part of the book called “A pre-interaction reflection – the breakdown of the box” I first start out with a general reflection around xxviii “the box” as a traditional framing of computers and how this box is now breaking down everywhere. In chapter 1 called “Interaction” I then take “the breakdown of the box” as a point of departure for moving our thinking away from the boxes, and more in the direction of why interaction matters and why we should focus on interaction as a core element in any digital design project.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

<li>&quot;Although there is a continuous line of argument, I have tried to construct the book so that (to some extent) the chapters can be read independently of each other. (Note added in 2015: the chapter organisation has been significantly altered since the first edition. What follows applies only to the first edition. )So Chapter 1 introduces the puzzle of representation and discusses pictorial, linguistic and mental representation.&quot;[Crane, Tim *The Mechanical Mind: A Philosophical Introduction to Minds, Machines and Mental Representation*. 3rd ed.

<li>&quot;Heidegger collated these notes with the help of a number of assistants and approved the final typescript in spring of 1961. Since access to the original notes is restricted, and because the notes themselves are fascinating documents, I have prepared a description of one complete page of the notes and a comparison of it to the relevant pages of the Neske edition as an Appendix to the present volume. (See also a photographic facsimile of that page following p. 223. )There is one serious error on this page as transcribed in the Neske edition, volume one, page 51, line 22.&quot;[Heidegger, Martin, and David Farrrell Krell *Nietzsche, Vol. 1: The Will to Power as Art, Vol. 2: The Eternal Recurrance of the Same*.
