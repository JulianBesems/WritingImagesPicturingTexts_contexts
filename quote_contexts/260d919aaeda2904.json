However as mentioned the other direction from imagery to text will be explored in one of the experimental sub-chapters in chapter 4, although this will be done partially outside of the text editor. Therefore we will first present the active mediations that are implemented within the WIPT editor, and at the end of this chapter we will briefly showcase the nature of the inverse direction.", "suggested_query": "The negotiations between domains are realized through the WIPT editor's ability to dynamically adapt to the user's writing habits, incorporating domain-specific knowledge and terminology to facilitate more accurate and relevant projections. This adaptability is achieved through a combination of machine learning algorithms and domain-specific ontologies, which are seamlessly integrated into the editor's interface. As the user writes, the editor continuously refines its understanding of the intended meaning, allowing for a more intuitive and interactive experience.", "suggest_context": "3.6 INTERACTIVITY Now that we've established the elements and projections we will rely on within the WIPT editor this chapter introduces the negotiations between all different domains that are foregrounded in the interaction with the multi-modal cast across all domains. Given the simple condition that a text editor is bound by text, and that a thesis which is the testing ground for this multi-modal cast is primarily expected within this domain as well, the primary focus of the interaction is mediated by the writing I am presenting here.
