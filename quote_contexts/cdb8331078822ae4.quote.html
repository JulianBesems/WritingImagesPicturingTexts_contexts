      <li>&quot;There is something stony in a work of architecture, wooden in a carving, colored in a painting, spoken in a linguistic work, sonorous in a musical composition. The thingly element is so irremovably present in the art work that we are compelled rather to say conversely that the architectural work is in stone, the carving is in wood, the painting in color, the linguistic work in speech, the musical composition in sound. &quot;Obviously,&quot; it will be replied. No doubt. But what is this self-evident thingly element in the work of art?&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;If all art is in essence poetry, then the arts of architecture, painting, sculpture, and music must be traced back to poesy. That is pure arbitrariness. It certainly is, as long as we mean that those arts are varieties of the art of language, if it is permissible to characterize poesy by that easily misinterpretable title. But poesy is only The Origin of the Work of Art $) 71 one mode of the lighting projection of truth, i. e. , of poetic composition in this wider sense. Nevertheless, the linguistic work, the poem in the narrower sense, has a privileged position in the domain of the arts.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;Art works universally display a thingly character, The Origin of the Work of Art $0 39 albeit in a wholly distinct way. The attempt to interpret this thingcharacter of the work with the aid of the usual thing-concepts failed—not only because these concepts do not lay hold of the thingly feature, but because, in raising the question of its thingly substructure, we force the work into a preconceivedframeworkby which we obstruct our own access to the work-being of the work. Nothing can be discovered about the thingly aspect of the work so long as the pure self-subsistence of the work has not distincdy displayed itself.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;Such a clear-cut outlook was favourable to the development of a perfected plastic art fundamentally simplified in kind; of Greek simplicity Christian, to-day we and, indeed, the rise Art was extremely rapid. On the over-intense of this stem was grafted the complexity first of then of scientific thought, with the result that have no definite aesthetic orientation. Irresistibly the Greek basis of ourcivilization claims belief in its ideals ; but to these ideals the complexity of modern thought was Fic. 2.&quot;[The art and craft of drawing, Vernon Blake, 1927]</li>
<li>&quot;Anyone can easily see that we are moving in a circle. Ordinary understanding demands that this circle be avoided because it violates logic. What art is can be gathered from a comparative examination of actual art works. But how are we to be certain that we are indeed basing such an examination on art works if we do not know beforehand what art is?And the nature of art can no more be arrived at by a derivation from higher concepts than by a collection of characteristics of actual art works. For such a derivation, too, already has in view the characteristics that must suffice to establish that what we take in advance to be an art work is one in fact.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;Our opinions express our experiences; Aristotle is about to transform them into knowledge of knowledge. The wise man is thought (t) to know everything in its generality and (~) to have the capacity to know difficult things, or whatever is not easy for a human being to know. Furthermore, whoever has more precise knowledge (3), and whoever is more capable of teaching the cau&lt;es (4) i&lt; thought to be wiser. And just as the science which is for its own sake and for the sake of knowing is thought to be wisdom to a greater degree than any science sought for the sake of its consequences (5), so the more architectonic science is thought to be wisdom rather than any science that serves it (6).&quot;[The Argument of the Action: Essays on Greek Poetry and Philosophy    , Seth Benardete, Ronna Burger, Michael Davis, 2000]</li>
<li>&quot;It thus seems advisable to define the nature of creative work in terms of its craft aspect. But reference to the linguistic usage of the Greeks, with their experience of the facts, must give us pause. However usual and convincing the references may be to the Greek practice of naming craft and art by the same name, techne, it nevertheless remains oblique and superficial; for techne signifies neither craft nor art, and not at all the technical in our present-day sense; it never means a kind of practical performance.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;The work&#x27;s createdness, however, can obviously be grasped only in terms of the process of creation. Thus, constrained by the facts, we must consent after all to go into the activity of the artist in order to arrive at the origin of the work of art. The attempt to define the work-being of the work purely in terms of the work itself proves to be unfeasible. In turning away now from the work to examine the nature of the creative process, we should like nevertheless to keep in mind what was said first of the picture of the peasant shoes and later of the Greek temple.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;To be sure. The distinction of matter and form is the conceptual The Origin of the Work of Art $j) 27 schema which is used, in the greatest variety of ways, quite generally for all art theory and aesthetics. This incontestable fact, however, proves neither that the distinction of matter and form is adequately founded, nor that it belongs originally to the domain of art and the art work. Moreover, the range of application of this pair of concepts has long extended far beyond thefieldof aesthetics. Form and content are the most hackneyed concepts under which anything and everything may be subsumed.&quot;[Poetry, Language, Thought , Martin Heidegger, 2001]</li>
<li>&quot;based upon objective comprehension and the highest human thought, is the appcr^u that time and space are known by us a priori. Gratified by this happy hit, he wished to pursue the same vein further, and his love of architectonic symmetry afforded him the clue. As he had found that a pure intuition or perception a priori underlay the empirical perception as its condition, he certain pure conceptions as presuppositions in our faculty of knowledge must lie at thought that in the same way the foundation of the empirically obtained conceptions, and that real empirical thought must be only possible through a pure thought a priori, which, however, would have no objects in itself, but would be obliged to take them from So that as the Transcendental ^Esthetic estab an a priori basis of mathematics, there must, he supposed, also be a similar basis for logic and thus, then for the sake of symmetry, the former received a pendant perception.&quot;[The World As Will And Idea, Arthur Schopenhauer, 2008]</li>
