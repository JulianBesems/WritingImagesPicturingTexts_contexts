    <pre>Figure 1.2.2:1 - The 3D model as a mediating construct in architectural communication. Plans, sections, and perspectives each project different but interdependent aspects of the design; none can be directly translated from another. The 3D model functions as a cast that coordinates these modalities by proportion rather than equivalence. Hypothesis The complete internalisation of architectural design into a computational model through Cartesian encoding is unable to successfully communicate abstractions of a design process. In the same way that sqrt2 is not reducible to a finite rational ratio, architectural design cannot be exhausted by Cartesian geometry. We relate to the sqrt2 through an understanding of the operation of the square root, or the proportions of the isosceles right triangle Fig. 1.22:2, which enable ourselves to communicate with it, even if not deterministically calculated. In a similar way there are aspects of architectural design that can be sought to be expressed through the proportionality of its parts, understood through the perception and operations that hold together a totality without collapsing it. As Ishigami writes: The experience of architecture is the manifestation of the totality of perceptions of the space as synthesized by the person having the experience. - Ishigami, Small Images Figure 1.2.2:2: Square root as diagonal of the unit square Taking an instance of Ishigami&#x27;s work to illustrate this point, we cannot prove that the KAIT workshop by Ishigami Fig.1.2.2:3 produces x number of spaces, however we can speak and communicate about how a connection of open areas is experienced from the constellation of the columns. There is a compelling spatial quality that can be discerned, not unlike how we cant calculate the value of pi, but we are most certainly able to speak about it based on how we understand it through the operation of rotation that gives rise to its definition. In Foucault&#x27;s words: &quot;The problem is no longer one of tradition, of tracing a line, but one of division, of limits; it is no longer one of lasting foundations, but one of transformations that serve as new foundations, the rebuilding of foundations.&quot; Figure 1.2.2:3 - Internal Photograph of The Kanagawa Institute of Technology Workshop by Junya Ishigami Likewise, multimodal ML can transition between objects and indexes, but what matters architectonically is not the projection alone. The interpretative act sits in the encoding, the selection of casts and screens, and the re-proportioning of the resulting set; how an instrument is tuned, and how its replies are taken up as part of a thinking process. Research Question The contribution of this research is to stage a limited and situated experiment with textimage modalities, as a preliminary probe into how architectural reasoning might be extended to computational multimodality. Its central aim is to test how multimodal ML models, when approached architectonically, might sustain proportion and heterogeneity between modalities, and avoid collapsing them into equivalence. In doing so, it frames a methodological

<em>The experiment unfolds through a series of iterative steps, where text-image modalities are introduced, tested, and re-proportioned to better accommodate the complexities of architectural design. The initial stage involves training a multimodal model on a dataset of architectural designs, allowing it to learn the relationships between different modalities. The model is then asked to generate a new design, which is evaluated based on its ability to capture the essence of the original design while introducing novel and meaningful variations. The process is repeated, with the model being fine-tuned and re-proportioned to better suit the requirements of the design task. Through this iterative process, the model is able to generate designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and coherent. The result is a new form of architectural design that is capable of capturing the complexities and nuances of the design process.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Although such programs are beginning the work of creating a culture and tradition of research, borrowing from more established fields such as psychology, computer science, and linguistics, Richard Buchanan (1999) has argued that design is different from traditional academic fields, a “transdiscipline” that focuses not on subject matters but on problems and on production as a mode of inquiry.

<li>&quot;The use of typical situations as a primary vehicle of design is a new departure toward an approach that may best be described as situational or as a new poetics of architecture (figure 8. 15). The aim of the new poetics is not to become a new theory but to formulate a limited set of creative principles, articulate in the fullest possible way the content and structure of the typical situations, and establish the basic orientation of design. The articulation of content may include contributions from nonarchitectural areas, such as theater, painting, literature, or poetry, where we very often find a surprisingly rich understanding of architectural space.&quot;[Vesely, Dalibor *Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation: The Question of Creativity in the Shadow of Production*.

<li>&quot;We flirted with a systematic approach to game design and tried two alternative models—one based on cooperation, one on competition—to be tested for research and classroom use. In the initial interface, we imagined the game taking place from a “source text” as a series of “moves” composed in a “work space” that could make use of textual, musical, visual, or time-based media materials.&quot;[Hawk, Byron, David M. Rieder, and Ollie Oviedo *Small Tech: The Culture of Digital Tools*. Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;She emphasizes that to understand and use the computer as a “representational medium,” designers should be able to draw on history, myth, ritual, narrative, patterns of repetition, and spatial and temporal orientations—rhetorical resources, all—as well as on technical considerations such as database design and user-interface development. Integrating the disciplines of written, oral, and visual communication, each with its own resources for theory and research, could produce important academic programs positioned to address the communication practices and problems of a digital age.&quot;[Petraglia, Joseph, and Deepika Bahri *Realms of Rhetoric: The Prospects for Rhetoric Education*. 2011.]</li>

<li>&quot;This approach can instead involve “metaphorizing” the literal sentences in the relevant discourse segment: translating the information in them into sourcedomain terms. We present this possibility as a potentially fruitful topic for future research into metaphor. Conclusion AI is not just about the engineering of “intelligent” artefacts for useful purposes but also about mapping out the space of possible principles and mechanisms of cognition, whether artificial or natural.&quot;[Jr., Raymond W.

<li>&quot;Their use in industrial design, artistic applications, and museum interaction entails some innovative uses for touch in a craft and design context. Traditional CAD/CAM utilizes a predominantly visual interface, requiring movement of the mouse on a two-dimensional (2D) desktop to be translated into a threedimensional (3D) virtual model within a visual display. Traditional input through the keyboard and mouse, as Robert Stone argues, is regarded as “very user-unfriendly and completely inadequate for creating organic, free-form shapes” (“MUSE Virtual Presence”).&quot;[Hawk, Byron, David M.

They argued that &quot;the two-domain model is actually part of a larger and more general model of conceptual projection,&quot; and they called this new model the &quot;many-space&quot; model. 3 Both the earlier two-domain model and the later many-space model of conceptual integration are part of ongoing research. into blending (see Coulson &amp; Oakley, eds. 2000). The most widely disseminated definition of blending can be found on Turner&#x27;s web-site (http://www. wam. umd. edu/---mturn/), as well as in many of his articles and will therefore be reproduced here as the standard definition: Conceptual blends arise from conceptual integration.&quot;[Dirven, Rene, and Ralf Porings *Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast (Cognitive Linguistics Research, 20.)*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Each section proposes complementary and comparative views from interdisciplinary research (mostly anthropological, but also sociohistorical and science-historical) on different areas of practice. Showing by contrast is both a strategy for apprenticeship and the style of these case studies. For example, brain imaging is compared to navigating skills; wood-sculpting to C. A. D. (computer-aided design) drawing; the Linnaean botanical drawings used in colonial botany are compared against pictorial production in the colonies; the skills of medieval masonry with the ones of managing the London underground traffic.&quot;[(ed.), Cristina Grasseni *Skilled Visions: Between Apprenticeship and Standards*. Berghahn Books, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;From a scientific perspective, it seems to be perfectly possible to bring continuous adaptation and operation to processes, but that does not mean there is still a clear model for how to do this. The problem is quite similar to the one studied by Deming. The answer might begin by factoring out the semantics of a process completely into a different level of description, leaving behind a purely dynamical one, without risk of semantic instability. The role of the ‘composer’ is then to design a performance that is stable and repeatable, with a continuous viewpoint.&quot;[Burgess, Mark *In Search of Certainty: The Science of Our Information Infrastructure*. O&#x27;Reilly Media, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;On average, the resulting time window lasted 1073 ms, with some modest variation between items and conditions, given the separate recordings that had to be used for this part of the stimuli. Target advantage scores were computed as detailed above and transformed into empirical logits. As before, we used mixed-effects models to analyze the data. As the range of possible random effect structures (RES) becomes more complex in an interaction design, we use the following shorthand indications to facilitate presentation of results.&quot;[(eds.), Florian Schwarz *Experimental Perspectives on Presuppositions*.

<li>&quot;But methodical work provides a different kind of support. It retains the knowledge that emerges through intuition. We use both these work approaches, intuitive and methodical, in successful systems development, and the skill lies in the ability to alternate between the two, in being able to use the intuitive process to create new knowledge, and the discursive process for critical comparative evaluations. They become interwoven so that the discursive process in its turn opens the door for the intuitive process.&quot;[Goranzon, Bo, Richard Ennals, and Maria Hammeron *Dialogue, Skill and Tacit Knowledge*. 2006.]</li>
