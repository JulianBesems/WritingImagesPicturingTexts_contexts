They are no longer concerned with adding decorative elements to the exterior of a building, but rather with creating a sense of ornament through the manipulation of light, color, and texture. For example, the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma has used natural materials such as wood and stone to create structures that are both functional and beautiful, with the beauty being derived from the materiality of the surface rather than any external embellishments. Similarly, the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava has used flowing lines and curves to create a sense of movement and dynamism, with the surface of the building becoming a dynamic and expressive entity that is greater than the sum of its parts.*", "suggested_query": "This tension between the absence of structure and the presence of surface has led to a new generation of architects who are rethinking the role of ornament in their designs.
