02. "Second, on the way out from the cottage one would be able to pause within the thickness of the wall to assess the weather. Third, it is within the thickness of the wall that greetings and farewells would be made.

05. "The entrance of Wright’s Rosenbaum house is the meeting place of the domestic realms of day and night. Admittance and Defence If there is need for a wall (to keep things in or out) then a break in that wall in the form of a doorway is a point of weakness. Robert Frost’s poem ‘Mending Wall’ (1915) contains the lines: ‘Before I built a wall I’d ask to know What I was walling in or walling out, And to whom I was like to give offence. ’ An equivalent test can be applied to the wall’s counterpart, the doorway; we only need to invert the ideas in Frost’s lines: Before I built a doorway I’d ask to know What I was allowing in or allowing out, And from whom (or what) I was like to need defence."[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]

06. "Hundreds can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see. To see clearly is poetry, prophecy, and religion – all in one’. Christopher Le Brun When Caspar David Friedrich claimed that, ‘The artist should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within himself. If he sees nothing within himself he should also forgo painting what he sees before him …’, he not only captured the essence of Romanticism; he also posed a fundamental question with which art has been concerned ever since."[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]

08. "In this same document he changed his professional designation, and therein lies a tale almost as interesting as his name. No longer an orafo, he is now a maestro di intaglio, a master carver, which we would call a sculptor. This is how Donatello had identified himself for over twenty years, and this is how Filippo’s surrogate son Buggiano identified himself."[Walker, Paul Robert *The Feud That Sparked the Renaissance: How Brunelleschi and Ghiberti Changed the Art World*.

10. "67 SPACE AND MUSLIM URBAN LIFE CONCLUSION In a series of reﬂections upon space, the architect Bernard Tschumi asks: “If space is neither an external object nor an internal experience (made of impressions, sensations and feelings), are space and ourselves inseparable?Are objective social space and subjective inner space then inextricably bound together?”1 It would be an improbable book that attempted to answer these questions in its closing pages; they are cited to complicate the commonly held belief that space lies outside of us and our subjectivity and is quantiﬁable. 2 Discussing representations of cities in One Thousand and One Nights, Richard Van Leeuwen expresses well this lack of a clear divide between subjective and objective space: Space is not only part of the material world, it is also part of various imaginary worlds."[O'Meara, Simon *Space and Muslim Urban Life: At the Limits of the Labyrinth of Fez (Culture and Civilization in the Middle East)*. 2007.]

12. "In the evening, facing in the general direction of north, an astronomer-priest would observe the passage of the stars across the sky. He would mark the wall where a given star first rose above it. Later that night, he would mark where the star disappeared behind the wall. The midpoint between these two points is north. This observation could be repeated many nights with different stars to obtain an exact reading for north. 31 Another astronomical method of determining north has recently been suggested."[Brier, Bob, and Jean-Pierre Houdin *The secret of the great pyramid : how one man's obsession led to the solution of ancient Egypt's greatest mystery*.
