The films were selected based on a set of criteria, including their genre, release date, and cultural significance. Once the films were selected, they were analyzed using a combination of natural language processing and manual content analysis to identify key themes and patterns.", "suggest_context": "3.1 OUTLINE - The text editor operates in a multi-modal manner, constantly both personal and general. - There are different layers of private and public: the private construct of choices and curation facilitates the projection on the common sense - The Scales of the data differs. Therefore the role of the model is here interpreted as the curation and construction of the correlation between the modalities that are facilitated by a chosen set of multi-modal documents. The primary dataset for this is a selection of 215 films which are used as the primary model used to write this thesis. This chapter will describe how this model is constructed and how other modes can be used to establish other biases, which will be demonstrated in the writing of chapter 4."}
