Selected: 3. It can often take an inordinate amount of thought and effort to do things simply. And a highly developed aesthetic. 4. A modernist aesthetic theory: the more highly developed the aesthetic sense, the more subtle and simple the style, and the more arcane the code. 5. Style and taste are particular sorts of intelligence. 6. The style of studied nonchalance is the psychological triumph of grace over order. 7. In matters of taste, if you can see the trees well enough, you don’t have to see the forest.[Boyer, G. Bruce *True Style: The History and Principles of Classic Menswear*. Basic Books, 2015.]

The one discovered most  recently (as I pointed out in my essay in [Deutsches] Kunstblatt 1855, nos. 42 ff. ) has  been wrongly ascribed to the Temple of Polias as well. They have been just as wrongly  connected with the ova or egg-and-dart moldings with which the cymatia of the Ionic  order are so richly decorated.

An unimaginative and inartistic mind wants to see such symbols applied with a  strict structural logic or wants to explain their traditional applications (for example, on  ancient entablatures) rigorously down to the last detail by reference to a real (earlier or  current) structural system for temple roofs and ceilings. In his Tektonik der Hellenen,  Bötticher attacks this homebred approach without ever quite emancipating himself  from it completely. He attempts to disprove Vitruvius’s theory of the origin of rafter  heads, for example, merely by its lack of logic (Tektonik, 2:83).

"He was hoping, among other things, to see Constructivist artist Vladimir Tatlin’s Monument to the Third International, a tower of steel, glass, and iron in the form of a double helix spiraling four hundred meters high. Tatlin had made a model for the tower in 1919, but, as Noguchi discovered, the tower had never been built. The tower’s openwork structure would remain in Noguchi’s mind when, three years later, he designed his Bolt of Lightning … Memorial to Ben Franklin (actually built in 1984). Noguchi’s various pylons that twist according to the double helix and even the openwork metal spiral of his Challenger monument (1988) may refer back to Tatlin as well."[Herrera, Hayden *Listening to Stone: The Art and Life of Isamu Noguchi*.

15. "Perhaps this unusual craftsman, with his strange visions and his unique subjective perceptions, could indeed see the becoming and the passing of things.

21. "Like the book, which appears to be a love story but is something else, so the museum only appears to be a museum of social and urban history. Though both novel and installation give a remarkably resonant portrait of a complex city at a very particular moment in its long history, they are in fact an exploration of the nature of collecting and its obsessive character. And that is what sets the museum apart from any museum of civic life that it may superficially resemble.

The model workshop, a period room of sorts, had this disclaimer: "The taxidermist's shop is for work, and not for visitors, and only the chosen few are admitted to the presence of half-mounted birds and beasts. "Things haven't really changed.

25. "In environmental terms they represent a great deal of energy locked up and serving a useful purpose. It would be crazy to replace them as it is crazy and mistaken to see 1960s’ public buildings as disposable.

That too was a mistake, but many only see that with hindsight."[Franklin, Adrian *Collecting the 20th Century*. University of New South Wales Press, 2010.]
