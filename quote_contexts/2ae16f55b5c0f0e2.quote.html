    <pre>Mornings in ground and first Hoar, afternoon in ventilated basement. Vertical nomadism And when I stepped onto the area of clean fresh floor in the art gallery I was concerned that I had maybe stepped onto something that did not have the same solid firmness as the proper floor. A drawing representing a horizontal section taken above a floor to show, diagrammatically, the enclosing walls of a building, its doors and windows, and the arrangement of its interior spaces. FLOOR Infinitely harmless, the floor Is obliged to offer Its occupants stability - yet receives from Its users systematic harshness, If not abuse, in return. Homogeneous space is in no way a smooth space; on the contrary, it is the form of striated space. The space of pillars. It is striated by the fall of bodies, the verticals of gravity, the distribution of matter into parallel layers, the lamellar and laminar movement of flows. could send mistake last look least lived yet going best care tell lose longer around mind good nothing living seeing stand difficult already together anyway middle leg worked instead somewhere place became either might follow truth first long lot joke

<em>As I walked further into the gallery, the hum of fluorescent lights overhead and the soft chatter of visitors around me created a disorienting atmosphere, like being suspended in a cloud of suspended particles. The pillars, spaced at regular intervals, cast long, dark shadows on the floor, making me feel like I was navigating a labyrinth of darkness and light. The air was thick with the scent of fresh paint and varnish, a potent reminder of the art that surrounded me.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;A first mechanism of modulation, then, is the recognition of patterns.

<li>&quot;Let us start with the first meaning. The subject as “subjectum” highlights notions such as “to be placed below,” “to be put beneath something. ” If we link such a meaning to the question of feelings, then we can say that the subject, in this first form, appears as the “support” or the “base” for feeling, at once set back, placed behind, and what gives them sense.&quot;[Gaskill, Nicholas, A.
