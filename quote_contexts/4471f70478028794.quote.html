    <pre>In discussing the character of ornament, and to then suggest an operative sense of digital ornament, I begin from the surface, as both the primary substrate or even condition for ornamentation. Ornament embellishes; it is what meets the eye: pattern, colour, relief. Therefore, at first it presents at surface-level.

<em>Ornament is often relegated to the realm of the superficial, where it is seen as mere decoration, lacking depth or substance. Yet, in the context of digital ornament, this superficiality is precisely what allows it to operate as a means of communication, as a way to convey meaning and significance. Moreover, the surface-level presentation of ornament raises questions about the relationship between the digital and the physical, and the ways in which these two realms intersect.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;It has taken longer to find a way to accommodate flat screens to the domestic environment. Hanging them like pictures on the wall with a dangling power cord is somehow too intrusive. The impact of digitalization in many areas of technology has been to diminish the traditional role of the designer as a sculptural shape-maker. Design has turned into something that involves a sequence of images on a flat screen, and developing a logical way to move through them.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*.

<li>&quot;Successful ethnography calls for an awareness of aesthetic components whatever the medium. It can gain especially from a greater understanding of the way language is applied within a given culture in that special kind of verbal transaction we call poetry. It makes no difference whether that language is employed to amuse and entertain, to assure ceremonial success, to transmit important information, or to secure sacred expression. Poetic discourse matters as much as material culture doeseven though its medium of the human voice, whether in speech or in song, is ultimately ephemeral and non-material, save when it is recorded graphically by way of glyphs, codices, wampum, or the like; or save when it is stored via printed texts the way Europeans had learned to preserve it by the time they began to arrive in the New World.&quot;[Halpern, Katherine Spencer, and Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian *Washington Matthews: studies of Navajo culture, 1880-1894*.

<li>&quot;Reskinning the Everyday | | 315 | Mary Flanagan | | 316 | | Figure 15. 6 | Natural network lines Computer programming is the heart of the creation of software, and it too is influenced by metaphors—in fact, metaphors in programming have a strong affect on how digital tools are made and used. Therefore, a look at the structures informing the programming process—specifically at the way objects are created in object-oriented programming—is essential in the exploration of the way in which everyday digital experiences are also structured.&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;On the contrary, it is the particular way of wearing these clothes which constitutes dandyism. ”13 It is in this “particular way of wearing . . . clothes” that dandies transform their bodies into art. Clothing rests close to the body; it is not surprising that dress has its somatic reverberations in disguise and displacement, and that it can be the material of self-transformation and artistic transformation. In fact, as Barbey d’Aurevilly’s analysis of Brummell’s dandyism reminds us, the dandy is both artist and living art: his presence has a doubled density.&quot;[Fillin-Yeh, Susan *Dandies: Fashion and Finesse in Art and Culture*. New York University Press, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;The way that you pay for a mobile phone, the deliberate obscurity of the tariffs you are offered, these are all examples of experience design. And while design has been defined by mass production, the way in which the world is making things is also in rapid transition. The system of factories, the role of the designer and the technology of tooling, they are all vanishing. The impact of digital fabrication and the process commonly described as printing will radically change the way in which things are designed and made.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*.

<li>&quot;You’re wanting to create a particular look which in some way counters mainstream looks. JB: To what degree is irony part of a goth look?VS: It’s probably there— JB: And the cruciﬁx, that would be one way to think of it?VS: That’s a beautiful way to think of it. There is usually some kind of genuine interest in spirituality, but there’s also deﬁnitely an épater le bourgeois feeling about this: that you’re wearing a glow-in-the-dark cruciﬁx doesn’t mean that you’re a Christian in any kind of normal sense of the word.&quot;[Goodlad, Lauren M. E., and Michael Bibby (eds.) *Goth: Undead Subculture*. Duke University Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;In this milieu, the choice of dress becomes an important way both for establishing identity and demonstrating allegiances and is therefore a political as well as an expressive tool. Change in dress which is material signifies change in nonmaterial culture. “Dress … can be an extremely powerful, symbolic, ritualized way of expressing and reinforcing subtle values, relationships, and meanings in human cultures” (2015:123). A feature of the commercial system is the proliferation of computer and internet technology, which enables the transference of huge amounts of information, linking Think Fashion or Tradition?&quot;[Cliffe, Sheila *The Social Life of Kimono: Japanese Fashion Past and Present*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The designs form a membrane between the sacred and profane, protecting a way of being. Figures 15 and 16 are examples of male and female Enata tattoo. The spiritual and social distinctions registered so finely in Enata tattoo, when viewed by an outsider, invite speculation about gross differences between peoples. Visitors see in the fine distinctions variations of a single sign that indicates a departure from nature. Such a visible marker of the social allows travelers to approach the concept of a distinct way of life.&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*. Columbia University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Gilpin argued that between soft, classic beauty and grandiose terrifying sublimity lay a third way that could have elements of both. He suggested that what might be sublime or beautiful in nature could easily become lost when translated into painting. And consequently artists should seek to find a way of combining elements of roughness with order, elements of darkness with colour and light, into what was pictorially pleasing.&quot;[Moyle, Franny *Turner: The Extraordinary Life and Momentous Times of J.M.W. Turner*. Viking, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;He shows how our ideas about what is a logical line of thinking are body-based; in other words they derive their self-evidence from the way in which the body copes with the concrete world around it. He takes, for example, the meanings of the words in and out, up and down, and shows that we understand their meanings by a metaphoric process taken from bodybased ‘image schemas’. Johnson’s book demonstrates in a detailed and technical way how thoroughly ‘embodied’ the subject is.&quot;[Andrewes, Janet *Bodywork: Dress As Cultural Tool (African Social Studies Series)*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;The world has seen a move away from single denominational religious services with the standard two hymns, a couple of prayers, a few words about the deceased and a lot of grief, to a more celebratory pick-and-mix type of ceremony. People these days want it very much their own way. The fashion is to cut and paste anything that appeals from the major and minor religions and re-write them to your own idiosyncratic template, adding a healthy bit of paganism or the secular along the way, in order to create a sort of post-mortem potpourri.&quot;[Lindsay, Keith R. *And in the End: A Guide to the World&#x27;s Weirdest Funerals*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;So that when we speak about the potential of dress to communicate, identify and classify, we are usually speaking not only about dress itself, taken as a sign of identity, but also about the way dress inﬂuences the practice of identity. We are also noticing the introduction 3 way in which a manner of dressing enables and empowers the wearers to carry out their social or cultural identity and put it into practice. So here I shall be using the word ‘dress’ with its more verbal connotations, as it is used in terms such as ‘dressing the turkey’, or, in the equestrian arena, in words like ‘dressage’,3 a way of preparing or training.&quot;[Andrewes, Janet *Bodywork: Dress As Cultural Tool (African Social Studies Series)*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;This scene obviously functions figuratively. River appears through much of Firefly as innocent, childlike. In this episode in particular, she sometimes seems to relate to objects around her in a way that is divorced from the functions and meanings others give them, most notably in the case of the gun. One might view this as simply a sign of pathology or dysfunction, but there is another way of looking at it. She has a childlike sense of wonder when she examines things as &quot;bare&quot; objects, existing as such.&quot;[(Editor), Jane Espenson *Finding Serenity: Anti-heroes, Lost Shepherds And Space Hookers In Joss Whedon&#x27;s Firefly*. BenBella Books, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;The full significance of this rich tectonic combination becomes evident  only when combined with the supporting structure, which keeps it suspended  in a horizontal position. Not infrequently the horizontal frame is perceived in the same way as the  upright version, though it assumes a conventional top and bottom. For  example, framed ceiling panels were treated by the Alexandrine Greeks and  Romans like niches and tabernacles, on whose roofs were grouped figures or  arabesques. In a very similar, opulent way this motive was taken up again in  the Renaissance (see p. 149). &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;“I have a few piercings. I got them because I like the way they look on my body, and I can always take them out if I decide to get something else or they are inappropriate for work,”69 she says. For other people, piercing is not just about looks and convenience. They seek a deeper artistic meaning in their body adornment. As one 66 person with thirteen piercings explains, “It’s a way of personalizing myself. Something that I have and control that no one can take from me. Something that in some way, shape, or form can set me apart from everyone else. ”70 This statement may cut to the heart of piercing’s appeal.&quot;[Hirschmann, Kris *Tattoos, Body Piercings, and Art*. ReferencePoint Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;We can think about this in a different way. In a historical sense, the idea of the technological being embodied with biological capabilities is not new. The automaton has a direct connection with the investigation of the digital model of thought and matter. In some ways, the automaton suggests a superiority of thought over body. It is a way of speaking of chimera, of the polymorphic perversity in the ever-changing and combining body. It does not surprise me then that a tool that many architects are using to give a “visible body” to the genetic code is Maya, an animation software program.&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Thus, the only specific preposition Howitt uses—“behind”—refers to something that does not seem to be real. All other pointers are unspecific suggesting that when she is idling, the space around her takes on a blurry and vague quality. It is “around,” but only in the distance. According to Edward S. Casey, one possible way of explaining the relation between “space” and “place” and which of the two is primary or secondary is to say that “human experience starts from a mute and blank ‘space’ to which placial modifiers such as ‘near,’ ‘over there,’ ‘along that way,’ and ‘just here’ are added, sooner or later: presumably sooner in perception and later in culture” (Casey 1996, 15).&quot;[Liedke, Heidi *The Experience of Idling in Victorian Travel Texts, 1850–1901*.

<li>&quot;Architecture can either amplify such feelings of awe or anxiety, or assuage them.

<li>&quot;When describing a hat there are three main physical features to picture. Each feature contributes to the artistic dimension of the hat. The brimis it wide, narrow, flat, or rolled?The crownis it low or high?And, finally, the crease in the crownis there one, and if so, what does it look like?A cowboy didn&#x27;t say his hat was creased a particular way. He said it was &quot;bashed,&quot; as in, &quot;bashed this way or that way. &quot;&quot;[Abernethy, Francis Edward *Folk Art in Texas (Publications of the Texas Folklore Society)*. Southern Methodist University Press, Dallas, Texas, 1985.]</li>
<li>&quot;There are many nuances to the way clothing is worn on the body, particularly to its colours and how these emphasize the topography of the body and relate to emotional expression. This is especially important on the head, either as hats or headbands that cover the forehead . Clothes resurface the body with different colours and patterns analogous to the way in which the land changes. I discussed in Section One the way in which the surface of the land/body changes temporally through sequences of bright colours as a consequence of the agency of rain and fire, wind and sun.&quot;[Young, Diane Jane Barbara *The Colours of Things: Memory, Materiality and an Anthropology of the Senses in North Western South Australia*.

<li>&quot;In the example by Zakyu-An Senshō (page 133), because the writing is horizontal, the ideograms do not have a connecting line. However, when writing in upright form as here, the continuous movement of the brush strokes can be appreciated. ⑧ ⑨ ② ② ① ③ ⑥ ④ ① ⑤ ⑦ ① ③ ⑩ ② ④ ⑨ ⑤⑥ ⑦ ④ ⑧ ① ③ ③ ⑤ ② ① ⑥ ⑦ ⑨ ⑧ ② ⑤ ④ ⑥ ② ① ② ③ ④ ⑥ ① ⑤ ③ ⑦ ① ③ ⑩ ② ④ ⑤⑥ ⑦ ⑨ 136 SHODO The Quiet Art of Japanese Zen Calligraphy Gei Dō Kore Butsu Dō (“The Way of Art Is the Way of the Buddha”) All activities, including such creative work as writing poetry, painting, ceramics, performing on stage or on musical instruments, or the mundane daily necessities of cooking, washing, or cleaning can be carried out in the spirit of “The way of art is the Way of the Buddha. ” When a person is totally focused with body and soul on that activity, then even mundane duties are a path to the bussho within.&quot;[Sato, Shozo *Shodo: The Quiet Art of Japanese Zen Calligraphy; Learn the Wisdom of Zen Through Traditional Brush Painting*.

<li>&quot;The Romans, as it happens, did not look at their stru cture in this way. In chapter 1 a distinction was drawn between descriptive studie s of honor that are conceptual in their approach and those that are lexical. The implication of the previous paragraph is that if a society does have persona l honor, the n the notion as it exists in that society can only properl y be described by paying careful attention to the way that mem 14. This accords with the interpretation ofthe term given by Ihering. He called existimatio &quot;the Roman technica l term for honor [Ehre] in the sense in which the term is used in private law&quot; (Ihering 1898, 2:500).&quot;[Stewart, Frank Henderson *Honor*. Chicago University Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;But out of this they will devise the extraordinary. ” Walking as art calls attention to the simplest aspects of the act: the way rural walking measures the body and the earth against each other, the way urban walking elicits unpredictable social encounters. And to the most complex: the rich potential relations between thinking and the body; the way one person’s act can be an invitation to another’s imagination; the way every gesture can be imagined as a brief and invisible sculpture; the way walking reshapes the world by mapping it, treading paths into it, encountering it; the way each act reflects and reinvents the culture in which it takes place.&quot;[Solnit, Rebecca *Wanderlust: A History of Walking*. Penguin Books, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;A 1930 lexicon called American Tramp and Underworld Slang proposed, somewhat dubiously, that the vernacular use of hip came from “having one’s hip boots on—i. e. , the way in which they protect the wearer from bad weather or dangerous currents is analogous to the way in which awareness or sophistication arms one against social perils. ” This is a suspect etymology, but a beautiful metaphor for the actions of hip, a stillness amid chaotic motion. Words, of course, are not frozen in their origins, and hip has had a storied journey through history.&quot;[Leland, John *Hip: The History (P.S.)*. Harper Perennial, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;But if it is a faculty~ it is also a history, and just as histories enter into the functioning of the mimetic faculty, so the mimetic faculty enters into those histories. No understanding of mimesis is worthwhile if it lacks the mobility to traverse this two-way street, especially. pertinent to which is Euro-American colonialism, the felt relation of the civilizing process to savagery, to aping. • • • My way of traversing this two-way street takes me into an eccentric history which begins with the curious and striking recharging of the mimetic faculty caused by the invention of mimetically capacious machines such as the camera, in the second half of the nineteenth century.&quot;[Taussig, Michael *Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses*.
