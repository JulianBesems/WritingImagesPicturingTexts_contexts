This idea has been explored in various forms of research and development, from the early experiments with home automation systems to the more recent developments in the field of ambient intelligence.  The idea of a machine that can recognize and respond to human behavior, gestures, and emotions has also been explored in various forms of robotics and artificial intelligence research, from humanoid robots that can recognize and respond to human facial expressions to robots that can learn and adapt to new tasks through machine learning and reinforcement learning.  In this context, the concept of a \"soft architecture machine\" that can learn from and adapt to its users' needs and preferences can be seen as a precursor to these developments, as it seeks to create a machine that can recognize and respond to human behavior and emotions in a more intuitive and flexible way.  The idea of a machine that can recognize and respond to human behavior and emotions has also been explored in various forms of art and design, from interactive installations that can recognize", "suggest_context": "For a more exhaustive technical placement of pattern languages, shape grammars and related approaches within the history of architectural computation, I refer to Marinis overview of rule-based design models. Figure 1: Proof tree of the adjacency of two rooms in a DSL for architectural relations of space In earlier research by the author, as part of a bachelor thesis in Computing Science, this notion of a domain-specific language was tested on a different target: instead of focussing on bounding geometries, a formal syntax and semantics were formulated to describe relations between architectural spaces. Adjacency, containment and connectivity are specified in a formal grammar, and proof trees establish whether a given configuration satisfies a set of spatial constraints Fig. 1.1.3:1. In contrast to Alexanders verbal patterns, this DSL adheres to the specifications of formal languages in computer science. Its limitations, however, become immediately evident: even relatively simple declarations lead to a rapid combinatorial explosion in the proof trees, a direct consequence of the predicate-logic basis shared by such languages. The language is precise, but its very precision produces an opacity of its own. For the purposes of this thesis, the value of these formal and pattern-based approaches lies in the way they extend what counts as computable architectural content. Alexanders patterns encode social and spatial situations in textual form; shape grammars encode stylistic families as rule-based geometric transformations; the domain-specific language encodes spatial relations as logical predicates. Soft architecture machines and participatory encodings Alongside these rule-based approaches, a different strand of architectural computation emerged around Nicholas Negropontes The Architecture Machine 1970 and Soft Architecture Machines 1975. Rather than encoding a style or a set of patterns, Negroponte asks what it would mean to build an architecture machine: a design partner endowed with artificial intelligence, capable of learning, groping and fumbling with problems that neither human nor machine fully understands in advance. He frames this as a project of humanism through machines, seeking a symbiosis that is a cohabitation of two intelligent species. The machine is expected to recognise context, to handle missing information, to understand gestures, smiles, and frowns, and to transform noise into information through continuous dialogue with the designer. In Soft Architecture Machines, this stance is taken further: in most cases the architect is an unnecessary and cumbersome and even detrimental middleman between changing needs and their incorporation into the built environment, proposing instead a new kind of architecture without architects. Here the design process is reimagined as an ongoing conversation between inhabitants and an intelligent, responsive environment. Experiments such as URBANS and SEEK, where a robotic arm continually reorganises blocks in response to the activities of a colony of gerbils, stage architecture as the management of mismatches between the machines internal model and a volatile physical reality."}
