    <pre>To misread this layer as merely decorative is to strip it of speech. Although the aforementioned subjects of ornament are easily dismissed as kitsch from a contemporary view, the objects made their surface legible, not dissimilar to pictograms:

<em>...as if the hand of the maker, in the act of creation, had inscribed meaning upon the material, rendering it no longer static, but rather a dynamic, interactive entity.  The more one gazed upon these objects, the more the surface seemed to shift, like the slow unwinding of a thread, revealing hidden patterns and narratives.  In the end, it was not the object itself, but the act of interpretation that imbued it with significance.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;Attempting to account for a notion of the concrete cannot be  achieved by the act of pointing alone. It involves, in whatever  way, actions like concluding, deducing, inducing, abducing ;  describing, explaining, discerning. It depends upon operations  such as abstracting, extracting, exemplifying, instantiating,  realizing, bundling, sorting. It presupposes notions like individuality, indiscernibility, generality, essence, existence, instance.  In order to delineate and operationalize those, notions are  needed like forms, types,  tokens, schemes, templates,  characters, symbols. &quot;[INPUT: Hovestadt and Bühlmann - 2013 - Sheaves when things are whatever can be the case.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;While tattooing the boy, Tagi is called away to be executed; the intended star tattoo, unfinished, forms a cross on the boy’s hand. 21 Realism begins to take the form of revelation when “like the turning up of the palm of a hand Tagi disappeared around the jail” (“Cross,” 20), and the boy crosses the stream that separates his yard from the prison yard. Return- tatau and m a l u 39 ing to his own yard, the boy “looked back as if he had forgotten something” (“Cross,” 20), having moved from one world and one age to another.&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*.

<li>&quot;All of these ‘objective’ data come together for the true collector, in every single one of his possessions, to form a whole magical encyclopaedia, a world ordered, whose centre is in the fate of objects. It suffices to observe just one collector, as he handles the items in his showcase. No sooner does he hold them in his hand than he appears inspired by them, and seems to look through them into the distance, like a portent of the future.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*. Rizzoli Ex Libris, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;It was unsuccessful and doomed, like the artist’s receding planes, to disappear. Another inference can be made from this relief as to this artist’s understanding or misunderstanding of the principles of sculpture. Below the man’s right arm the woman’s right hand is carved, perhaps to reveal the pomegranate that she held in it. But her hand does not belong here. We cannot see a hand without having it suggest the lines of the arm or the shoulder. The suggestion here is wrong because it disagrees with those lines of the shoulder that are indicated by the woman’s head and the neck.&quot;[Von Mach, Edmund, and Parkstone Press *Greek Sculpture its Spirit and its Principles*.

<li>&quot;_B J 5 (, 7 5 The Cunas&#x27; idea of the construction of the world, according to Perez 117 I MIMESIS AND ALTERITY mountain strongholds, whirlpools, and clouds. This seems to me quite a different sense of spiritual geography than the levels, yet in its way it is even stranger because the sites exist bewilderingly as both fantastic and actual. They are physical sites, close at hand, with none of the splendid symmetry of axial sculpture of the multiple-layered cosmos like so many flapjacks piled one on the other.&quot;[Taussig, Michael *Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses*.

<li>&quot;“The pattern traced,” as Navatu describes it, “was like that printed on native cloth like the painted cloth of Nairukuruku. There were different methods of doing tattooing, like the different kinds of games, and they had two names—one, the ‘Net,’ because it looked like the meshes of a net; two, the Thala (Cala). ”46 The creation of the design was a major undertaking. One mid-nineteenth-century observer reported, “Months are often occupied in the process. ”47 A later nineteenth-century observer concurs, “The tattooing is not completed at a single sitting, but is completed in stages” (Vitilevu, 159).&quot;[Ellis, Juniper *Tattooing the World: Pacific Designs in Print and Skin*.

<li>&quot;From this they have concluded  that opus Phrygionium is a relatively new invention. 54 I do not accept this  conclusion but suspect rather it is the result of an unduly narrow interpretation of expressions like epTrdaaeii&#x27;, egTroiiciXXciv, ypd(J&gt;eiv, ixtaii/eii&#x27;, and so  on, which have a number of meanings and can refer to weaving, embroidery,  and even painting and all other possible means of representation. Artistic  embroidery is certainly older than artistic weaving, if one understands it to  mean figurative and illustrative representations stitched with thread on fabrics. 55 Colored weaving, on the other hand, may well have come into being  earlier than colored embroidery, that is, earlier than the simple embroidered  patterns that can be looked upon as an imitation of woven patterns and that  followed the constraints of a woven net.&quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;On one hand, there was concrete practice, and on the other hand imaginative lyricism; on one hand, an active sensibility, and on the other hand, art as a concept existing in disinterested freedom. The two worlds have skirted one another, yet always remained distinct. But today, in the most advanced experiments, I think we detect a negation (a self-suppression) of one of these two hemispheres, and that is the conceptual lyrical one. It is almost abdicating its role under pressure from the other sphere.&quot;[Poggi, Christine, Lawrence S. Rainey, and Laura Wittman *Futurism : an anthology*. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Concerns about the operation of natural causes and the extent of free will were at the root of these debates. If the lines on the hand were caused by the positions of the planets at the time of one’s birth, then one’s hand could be read as accurately as, or more accurately than, one’s nativity. Did a chiromancer read the natural signs of one’s character, like a physiognomer?&quot;[(ed.), Michael Sappol *Hidden Treasure  The National Library of Medicine*. Blast Books, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;But several hand gestures were also available to indicate tranquillity attained. One of these shows the Buddha extending his hand downwards, as if to touch base: he is calling upon the Earth to witness his achievement (Fig. 99). There is a sense in which every image of the Buddha is a response to that call to bear witness, and give visible and tangible honour to the intensely spiritual state of nirvana. As a Buddhist stanza has it: ‘This form of yours, calm yet lovely, brilliant without dazzling Soft but mighty – whom would it not entrance?&quot;[Spivey, Nigel *How Art Made the World: A Journey to the Origins of Human Creativity*. Basic Books, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Was it perhaps in battle?It doesn’t look as though it was in the fields – this doesn’t seem like the hand of a labourer. A fortune-teller of course would look at once for the lines on the palm of the hand; but the palm of this hand has been left unworked. There are lines, though, but they are on the back, and they are lines of text, written in an ancient Yemeni language which is linked both to modern Hebrew and to Arabic.&quot;[MacGregor, Neil *A History of the World in 100 Objects*. Penguin Group US, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;When you hold it up against a human hand, you are struck by how closely the two shapes match, although this one is unusually large and is too big for a human hand to hold it comfortably. It has also been very beautifully worked, and you can see the marks of the chipping that have shaped it. The very earliest tools, like the stone chopper we looked at in Chapter 2, strike us as pretty rudimentary. They look like chipped cobbles, and they were made by taking one large piece of stone and striking it with another, chipping off a few bits to make at least one sharp cutting edge.&quot;[MacGregor, Neil *A History of the World in 100 Objects*. Penguin Group US, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;It contains, to a large degree, sulphites that change the composition of colour molecules. Previously flat, they now take on the shape of a pyramid. In this new shape, the molecules cannot move around freely and are no longer able to distribute themselves within the whole molecule. The effect: they reflect all parts of the visible light again. So although the words remain on the page, they are no longer visible. It sounds like magic: What might sound like magic is actually a sleight of hand in chemistry.&quot;[Ward, James *Adventures in Stationery: A Journey Through Your Pencil Case*. Profile Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Instead of focussing on the pastimes at hand, the focus is on these objects: a hammer, a hand-net, a microscope, a rod and a gun. Thus equipped, one prosecutes the enjoyment one is looking for—the verb chosen here adds a formal, almost bureaucratic dimension. Yet it does not stop at that: the pleasure seeker then “ferrets out” (again, a peculiar word choice that conjures up the image of a busy, bustling crowd) to “feast” his eyes on whatever sight (or “prey”?)he has been referred to by the topographical work of his choice.&quot;[Liedke, Heidi *The Experience of Idling in Victorian Travel Texts, 1850–1901*. Springer International Publishing;Palgrave Macmillan, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;On the one hand, in the absence of an autonomous pictorial tradition, animal bones would inherit certain conventions of the characteristic representations of human bones. On the other hand, in their role as curiosities and regular items in cabinets and museums they also received a formal treatment like that accorded other fossils and natural products, engraved and standardized in those Enlightenment catalogues that were dominated by symmetry and the search for regularities among the forms of nature.&quot;[Pimentel, Juan *The Rhinoceros and the Megatherium. An Essay in Natural History*. Harvard University Press, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;About the year 1566 Titian got interested in the art to the extent of making a number of designs for reproduction by skilled engravers like Nicolo Boldrini, Domenico delle Grecche, Andreani and others. In 1519 delle Grecche cut a huge Submersion of Pharaoh upon twelve blocks clamped together as one, and later a Martyrdom of Ten Thousand which required eight blocks. Things like these are of little or no artistic value, but they show how the Italian mind was haunted by the thought of immense wall-paintings.&quot;[Bliss, Douglas Percy *A History of Wood Engraving  The Original Edition*. Skyhorse Publishing, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Many advanced techniques for scene composition depend upon human anatomy and psychology of perception. For example, there is a compositional concept called &quot;visual arrows&quot; that the interior of Serenity lends itself to, and the creators of the show used it very effectively. Simply put, visual arrows work like this: when a viewer looks at a scene, his or her eyes naturally flick across the entirety of the image like a pinball, lighting on a point then zooming away a fraction of a second later as the mind processes the image and evaluates the importance of its elements.&quot;[(Editor), Jane Espenson *Finding Serenity: Anti-heroes, Lost Shepherds And Space Hookers In Joss Whedon&#x27;s Firefly*.

<li>&quot;Ruﬄes add an element of suppressed personality and mischievousness, as though the pot was capable of twirling itself. Ohr often used ruﬄing in conjunction with a smooth, nondeformed surface, setting the whimsical undulations against the ﬁxed silhouette. Like a little boy in a tuxedo, ruﬄing is reminiscent of a struggle to free oneself of restrictions and discomfort. Ohr’s ruﬄes can be quite graceful, like ﬂower petals or rippling drapery.&quot;[Ohr, George E., Ellen J. Lippert, and George E Ohr *George Ohr : sophisticate and rube*. United States: University of Minnesota Press;University Press of Mississippi, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Beauty has nothing to do with art. TO DISCUSS A PAINTING OR A POEM BY STARTING WITH THE EMOTION THAT IT GIVES ONE IS LIKE TRYING TO STUDY ASTRONOMY BY CHOOSING AS ONE’S POINT OF DEPARTURE THE SHAPE OF ONE’S NAVEL. Emotion is a nonessential factor in a work of art. It can be felt or not felt, can vary from individual to individual and from moment to moment: it cannot serve as the basis for establishing an objective value. “Beautiful” or “ugly,” “I like it” or “I don’t like it,” these are all subjective, gratuitous, interesting but unverifiable.&quot;[Poggi, Christine, Lawrence S. Rainey, and Laura Wittman *Futurism : an anthology*. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;20 KATHERINE OTT Earlier arm and hand designs provided little movement. Hands were designed for a single activity. The client had a hand made to suit his or her most frequent activity, such as holding cards, grasping a pen, gripping a knife or pistol, or remaining rigid. 39 A hand had no variable tension or pinch—only hold and release functions, activated by a button. Because of their mechanical nature, prostheses with joint mechanisms were often made by locksmiths and clock makers. 40 A more complicated and expensive control system increasingly in use since World War II is the myoelectric appliance.&quot;[Ott, Katherine, David Serlin, and Stephen Mihm *Artificial Parts, Practical Lives: Modern Histories of Prosthetics*.

<li>&quot;This countering impulse toward decomposition, toward process and movement, unfixes things and promotes an alternative diastolic pressure. This juxtaposition of sensation and perception in the riders’ response to the cloud portent, combined with the inherently amorphous nature of clouds, establish this painting’s rhythmic oscillation between, on the one hand, the binding power of composition and line, and on the other hand, the potentially liberating release provided both by the aura of color and by the enchanted nature of animate matter in the everyday world of things.&quot;[Tatum, Stephen *In the Remington Moment*.
