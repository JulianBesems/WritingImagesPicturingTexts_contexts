In our case, now that the elements and projections of the WIPT editor are in place, this section turns to use: how writing interactively negotiates across the domains of the multi-modal cast in practice. Rather than a single deductive chain, interaction unfolds as a woven network of concurrent entries and crossings, more tapestry than thread, so that its cast is always oriented to the whole it approaches through successive correspondences.", "suggested_query": "The narrative of interaction thus becomes a story of perpetual re-weaving, of re-threading the fabric of meaning that has been unraveled by the reader's journey. In this way, the writer's task is not to present a definitive account, but to engage in a continuous process of negotiation and re-description, always seeking to re-align the threads of understanding in response to the reader's movements and explorations. By embracing the inherent multiplicity of meaning, the writer may come to regard the reader not as a passive recipient, but as an active co-weaver, whose own threads of interpretation are woven into the tapestry of the narrative.", "suggest_context": "3.6 INTERACTIVITY \"The new new scientific spirit has rediscovered the art of Penelope: while the sailor comes and goes, approaches and moves away, she weaves and unwinds the map of the journey, the portulan of the universe. - Serres, Le Systme de Leibniz et Ses Modles Mathmatiques.
