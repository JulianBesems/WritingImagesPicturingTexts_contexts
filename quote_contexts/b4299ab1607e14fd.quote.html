    <div class="selected">These strategies build on different premises and imply different research methods. In my view, we should not be too puritanic in the use of these research logics, as they are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Chapter 5 discusses the main elements of a research design. A research design is defined as a plan for how to organise the project in order to get from questions to answer. Two elements are essential in such a plan: First, the purpose of the project has to be clarified as well as—connected to it— the research questions.[Designing Social Science Research, Oddbjørn Bukve, 2018]</div>

      <li>&quot;For instance, in the paper “Conceptdriven Interaction Design Research” the authors Stolterman &amp; Wiberg (2010) argues that in the field of interaction design people do not only develop systems based on a human-centered design approach from problem identification to product in a similar process as criticized by Margolis &amp; Robinson (2007). Instead, it is a common approach to also follow a concept-driven process in which guiding theoretical concepts, like the notion of “interactive textures” work as a vision and raw model for the practical efforts made to realize such installations.&quot;[Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies, Mikael Wiberg, 2010]</li>
<li>&quot;Thus, a natural question is what are basic approaches to action and process that designers can use to conceptualize and analyze human activity and change?Similarly, the design of socially embedded systems involves representations in several ways. Representations serve as parts of systems themselves (e. g. , as representation of knowledge or of process), and they also serve as tools and methods in design processes. All of the chapters in this section have something to say about the nature and practice of representation, and its critical role in system content and in design process.&quot;[Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide, Geoffrey Bowker (Ed.), Susan Leigh Star (Ed.), Les Gasser (Ed.), William Turner (Ed.), 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;Likewise, the bi-directionality of exchanging information stored on paper and electronic media will make increasing use of graphic recognition capabilities. Overall, a technology that was originally motivated by the pressing need to convert paper documents containing graphics into electronic formats is becoming more and more useful in a variety of information technology domains never before thought of. Once the technology becomes mature enough, one can envision a team of humans working with robots, where both humans and robots read the same graphical document (displayed on any media) and coordinate their tasks based on understanding the same document.&quot;[Graphics Recognition Methods and Applications: First International Workshop University Park, PA, USA, August 10–11, 1995 Selected Papers, Lawrence O&#x27;Gorman (auth.), Rangachar Kasturi, Karl Tombre (eds.), 1996]</li>
<li>&quot;Other researchers within HCI have also sought to develop alternative methods that explicitly support the design process more. These include: 1. Design rationale. This aims to document and make the implicit aspects of the design process. The idea is that through explicating implicit knowledge more design alternatives can be explored while also providing a set of reusable designs to be readily available (e. g. , see Carroll, 1995; MacLean, Young, &amp; Moran, 1989).&quot;[Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide, Geoffrey Bowker (Ed.), Susan Leigh Star (Ed.), Les Gasser (Ed.), William Turner (Ed.), 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;Therefore, today we prefer to use other terms that do not have the negative connotations associated with the term “AI,” as you will learn in the following sections on evolutionary computation and on cellular automata. We will describe computation inspiration thus: Computational inspiration is a process of using natural evolution and growth processes to develop similar computational processes that can be used in computer programs for the automated development of design concepts, including inventive design concepts.&quot;[Inventive Engineering: Knowledge and Skills for Creative Engineers, Tomasz Arciszewski, 2015]</li>
<li>&quot;The developing process of such a system requires special attention to two stages of Software Engineering: analysis and design processes. The analysis process should take into account the interaction model PPKMS while the design process must take into account the reflective emotion level in the user interfaces design. In order to optimize the analysis activities, the IIGG has developed a systemic model of Santiago’s culture, using retroprospectivation process.&quot;[Advances in New Technologies, Interactive Interfaces, and Communicability: First International Conference, ADNTIIC 2010, Huerta Grande, Argentina, October 20-22, 2010, Revised Selected Papers, Francisco V.

<li>&quot;8. 2). 8 Viewed as an electronic document collection, our prototype was an exploration of the possibilities for combined use of text and images in the work of searching and browsing. More specifically, our prototype supported search with a full-text information retrieval program (Cutting, Pedersen, &amp; Halvorsen, 1991). Because only minimal labeling information folder name) was associated with the docu8The development of the prototype involved a three-way collaboration among M, the authors of this article, and Ramana Rao, a research colleague at Xerox PARC.&quot;[Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide, Geoffrey Bowker (Ed.), Susan Leigh Star (Ed.), Les Gasser (Ed.), William Turner (Ed.), 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;Moreover, we intend to leverage the supporting information provided by the current image search approaches. This topic has recently received plenty of attention in the community, and papers have presented various approaches to associate visual and textual data. One direction to address this problem is to utilize metadata that can be directly compared with queries. For instance, many web image search engines evaluate the relevance of an image based on the similarity of the query sentence with the user tags or the surrounding HTML text [4].&quot;[Computer Vision – ECCV 2016 Workshops: Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 8-10 and 15-16, 2016, Proceedings, Part I, Gang Hua, Hervé Jégou (eds.), 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;A more interesting approach is to provide the query as images, video, sketches, or text. However, this proposal will often require human interaction to periodically feed back advisory information to the search. For example, in content-based image retrieval, much research has turned to using sketches as a more natural way of querying an image. This trend has raised new challenges and research interests which are also expected to emerge in the shape retrieval and recognition community. Efficiency and large scale retrieval.&quot;[3D Imaging, Analysis and Applications, Reinhard Koch, Nick Pears, Yonghuai Liu (auth.), Nick Pears, Yonghuai Liu, Peter Bunting (eds.), 2012]</li>
<li>&quot;The focus on landscaping further implies an interest in not only the landscape as a fixed reality, but also in the process through which the landscape is constantly changing, reconfigured and adjusted through human actions and interactions, i. e. landscape as the process of landscaping. The focus on landscaping is further on a straight-forward implication from recent research within the fields of computer science, informatics, human-computer interaction, interaction design, etc which all have paid special attention to questions related to the design and use of e. g.&quot;[Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies, Mikael Wiberg, 2010]</li>
