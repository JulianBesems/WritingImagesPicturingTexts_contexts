    <pre>The floor is a site of the body in extremis. In tragic history plays and epics, at the point of climax, characters must keel over or fall over backwards onto the floor. In making object form, the floor is a medium of active forms that organize interplay and interdependence with spatial consequence. Floor coverings If floor coverings are to be used, a person must choose between carpeting, area rugs, or hard coverings, known as resilient floors. Carpeting helps unify the entire room. We identify ourselves with this space, this place, this moment and these dimensions become ingredients of our very existence. Architecture is the art of reconciliation between ourselves and the world, and this mediation takes place through the senses. Mornings in ground and first Hoar, afternoon in ventilated basement. Vertical nomadism And when I stepped onto the area of clean fresh floor in the art gallery I was concerned that I had maybe stepped onto something that did not have the same solid firmness as the proper floor. A drawing representing a horizontal section taken above a floor to show, diagrammatically, the enclosing walls of a building, its doors and windows, and the arrangement of its interior spaces.

<em>The floor&#x27;s materiality is a tangible manifestation of the architect&#x27;s vision, a reflection of the cultural and historical context in which it was built. In this sense, the floor is a palimpsest, bearing the imprints of countless footsteps, whispers, and laughter that have shaped its surface over time. As I stood there, my eyes tracing the lines of the floor&#x27;s geometry, I felt the weight of those accumulated moments, a sense of collective memory that seemed to emanate from the very pores of the concrete.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;On the top floor there are arched openings and hinged doors. Each of the three floors was built in a different style. The ground floor evokes the architecture of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto (pages 248–49), establishing an aristocratic ambience with finely carved decorative embellishments.&quot;[Ballantyne, Andrew *Key buildings from prehistory to the present : plans, sections and elevations*.

<li>&quot;You then build in your floor, so you’ve essentially created a large tub, filled with water.
