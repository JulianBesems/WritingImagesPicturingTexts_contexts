    <pre>Currently, this style of figurative ornamentation is widely seen as superficial, making the surface not just substrate but characterisation of the ornament. However, if we look beyond the figurative, and to the role of these subjects they also acted as indices of communication, expressing the nature of the building to which they were attached.

<em>These indices of communication have the potential to transcend their physical locations, serving as a form of visual language that can convey meaning and significance beyond the immediate context. In this sense, the ornamentation becomes a key to understanding the cultural and historical context of the building, providing a window into the past. As such, the superficiality of the ornamentation is revealed to be a façade, hiding a deeper significance that is waiting to be uncovered.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Munn;1973, Gell;1998). Social scientists have tended to consider colour as a surface, and therefore as a superficial perceptual quality, associated with the feminine. Colour is for them, linked to the transcendence of Kantian aesthetics. Hence colour, in the discipline of anthropology, has been seen merely as a sign system for a coded message, or as a specific kind of symbol due, not least, to the influence of structuralism. The emphasis on language in structuralism and post-structuralism has determined colour as meaning only, and has negated the complex power of colours in the inter-linked areas of evocations (emotional, spatial, temporal) and analogies (political, social, &#x27;ritual&#x27;, &#x27;everyday&#x27;) which they can communicate without words.&quot;[Young, Diane Jane Barbara *The Colours of Things: Memory, Materiality and an Anthropology of the Senses in North Western South Australia*.

<li>&quot;For instance, in Haiku poetry in particular, it is the absence of certain words that creates an ambiguity (Keene 1981: 14), and when negative space dominates positive space, it creates an ambiguous spatial element in Japanese watercolour painting. These characteristics of simplicity, irregularity, perishability and suggestion of meaning have been instilled in the history of Japanese writing and painting for thousands of years. In aesthetic terms, this sensitivity and subtleness are still considered important cultural components and remain a dominant force in contemporary Japanese art and design.&quot;[English, Bonnie *Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2011.]</li>

<li>&quot;In the strongly hierarchical symbolic systems of the past associated with royal prerogative, court power or established wealth, the ‘meanings’ immanent in landscape design were rather more clear-cut and instantly recognizable. This is not, however, so evident in the democracies and consumer societies of today, where design is frequently inflected to address l a n ds c ape s a n d m e an i ng s |  complex social and cultural (and increasingly, multi-cultural) interests and traditions. In the case of the cemetery, this sensitivity to the nuances of cultural taste has been too little evident.&quot;[Worpole, Ken *Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;The fact that dress communicates by ﬂouting the rules is due to the very diﬀerent relationship that clothes and outﬁts have with the cultural meanings they carry, when compared with words and sentences. To understand this one has to turn to the materiality of clothes and to their object-like qualities. Unlike language, where the link between the form of a word and the meaning that it carries is arbitrary and unmotivated—though more or less permanent, or at the least stable—clothes substantiate the cultural categories they represent.&quot;[Andrewes, Janet *Bodywork: Dress As Cultural Tool (African Social Studies Series)*. 2004.]</li>

<li>&quot;The same root applies to a “reply,” equating a material thing—or, in local language, a returned woman—to short-lived words. The strong sense is of material “discourse. ” Rather than (or in addition to) metaphor, the expression signals that objects might circulate like oratory. 46 Glyphic texts record gifts with a variety of terms. Again, the emphasis is bifurcated, split between that which was received or given away, what owed in or streamed out. With few exceptions, however, the language is ethereal and godly in tenor.&quot;[Houston, Stephen *The Gifted Passage: Young Men in Classic Maya Art and Text*. Hardcover.

<li>&quot;Evidenced in their exchange of sweet words was something that the philosopher Kenneth Burke has called the &quot;&#x27;principle of courtship&#x27; in rhetoric . . . the use of suasive devices for the transcending of social estrangem ent. &#x27;&#x27;For Burke estrangement is signaled by &quot;any embarrassment or self-imposed constraint&quot; in social intercourse, and its presence implies a &quot;corresponding mystery in communication,&quot; language activity marked not simply for gradations of social differentiation between interlocutors, but for fundamental differences of kind between them. &quot;&quot;[Sullivan, Paul R. *Unfinished Conversations: Mayas and Foreigners between Two Wars*. University of California Press, 1991.]</li>
<li>&quot;As the word’s shifting presence negotiates cultural and aesthetic tensions, it contributes to a genealogy of ugliness and to our contemporary understanding of the term. Since categorization inscribes meanings, different representations blur any singular reading of ugliness. Gathered together, ‘ugly’ groups can illuminate cultural tensions and even anticipate social contexts on the verge of change.&quot;[Henderson, Gretchen E. *Ugliness: A Cultural History*. Reaktion Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is a short logical leap to interpret these symbols as references to basic themes in Southeastern Indian cosmology, and similar design elements appear on both Mississippian and historic period Indian pottery (Hudson 1976; Saunders 1998). Saunders (1998) argues the same point using both historical analogy and information theory. Building on earlier theories of the relationship between artifact style and social interaction (e. g. , David et al. 1988; Hodder 1977, 1979, 1982; Wobst 1977) Saunders (1998:154–158) argues that the repetition of a few key elements in Swift Creek paddle stamps suggests that those elements are important cosmological symbols.&quot;[Deter-Wolf, Aaron *Drawing with great needles : ancient tattoo traditions of North America*.

<li>&quot;. . . Every cultural act lives on boundaries; in this is its seriousness and significance. ”26 Boundaries make creativity possible. Their abutments offer the physical sites for the resonance of many voices, for dialogue. In language that gives immediacy to the performance of aesthetic activity, Bakhtin enacts the visual dialogue of dandies, who, as observed and observers, raise the stakes of both enterprises.&quot;[Fillin-Yeh, Susan *Dandies: Fashion and Finesse in Art and Culture*. New York University Press, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;4) Not to limit analysis to the way the senses are used in a culture&#x27;s language, as this precludes embodied practices, and limits the analysis to one of discourse only (Howes I 990;40). Colour has often been described as a language&#x27; but colour, like the other senses cannot be reduced to meanings which are describable using words (cf Wittgenstein 1978). This thesis is an attempt to move from a language based symbolic analysis and idealist theory, towards considering the importance of colours as non-propositional images (Sheifflen 1985; Saunders 2000).&quot;[Young, Diane Jane Barbara *The Colours of Things: Memory, Materiality and an Anthropology of the Senses in North Western South Australia*. University College London, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;Recent anthropological interest in clothes and in dressing has pointed to the strong and subtle ways in which dress represents 1 2 See map, p. vi. An Islamic healer. 2 chapter one and communicates social and cultural identity. Authors have shown dress to be both reﬂective of and conducive to social ranking (e. g Weiner 1989), ethnic identity (e. g. Eicher and Erikosima 1995) and gender construction (Pancake 1992); it can function as a sign of status (e. g. Cort 1989), a badge of recognition (e. g.&quot;[Andrewes, Janet *Bodywork: Dress As Cultural Tool (African Social Studies Series)*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;Some scholars prefer the term &quot;International Style&quot; because of its employment by at least fifteen different cultures from the Maya of highland Guatemala and Yucatan to the Nahuatl- and Otomi-speaking civilizations of the Valley of Mexico (Robertson 1970). Nevertheless, there are very specific language-based applications, particularly with regard to the use of pictographic place signs (Smith 1973). More important to this discussion however are variant usages that reflect differing forms of social organization.&quot;[Boone, Elizabeth Hill, and Walter D. Mignolo *Writing Without Words: Alternative Literacies in Mesoamerica and the Andes*. Duke University Press Books, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;An ambiguity persists because only parts of these largely pictorial systems record language, and one senses an unease with defining writing outside of language. In her classic study of Mixtec place signs and maps, for example, Mary Elizabeth Smith (1973: 7) gets around the ambiguous position of Mixtec &quot;picture writing,&quot; by stating that &quot;the manuscripts to be discussed are pictographic expressions of this IMixtec] language,&quot; and then showing how the conventions and structure of Mixtec picture writing convey meaning without necessarily expressing language.&quot;[Boone, Elizabeth Hill, and Walter D. Mignolo *Writing Without Words: Alternative Literacies in Mesoamerica and the Andes*. Duke University Press Books, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;8. In Powers of Horror, Julia Kristeva makes an arresting point about a structure of subordination built into language itself. She says that the “sign”—the word—is an upstairs-downstairs affair, like a fraction whose horizontal line divides a top number and a bottom number. In language’s system, the word itself (a set of letters and sounds) rides above the horizontal line; the meaning hides below. (I might be twisting Kristeva’s point. )What lies below the line is occluded by the word above, a circumstance of servitude implying that words (as physical objects, as sounds) humiliate their absented meanings.&quot;[Koestenbaum, Wayne *Humiliation : big Ideas : small books*. New York: Picador, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;The reverse can also be true, and the same object can appear differently from another perspective. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein described the ambiguous ‘duck-rabbit’ that could be seen (as in, interpreted) not as a hybrid combination but rather as two entirely different species. 36 Like visual perspective, cultural perspective influences interpretation. The Japanese concept of wabi-sabi arises from terms meaning ‘poverty’ and ‘loneliness’, associated with qualities that to traditional Western eyes might appear ugly (asymmetry, imperfection, disintegration, impermanence) but which, in Japanese culture, carry beautiful connotations. 37 Aspects of wabi-sabi include ‘the withered, weathered, tarnished, scarred, intimate, coarse, earthly, evanescent, tentative, ephemeral’, embodied more by ‘a broken earthenware cup in contrast to a Ming vase, a branch of autumn leaves in contrast to a dozen roses, a lined and bent old woman in contrast to a model’. 38 Aesthetic and cultural lines entangle as physical migrations mix cultural priorities, challenge inherited values and open up new possibilities for both aesthetics and culture.&quot;[Henderson, Gretchen E. *Ugliness: A Cultural History*. Reaktion Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Such cultural geography on the norfolk broads 25 description falls so easily into inventory form in which one unrelated fact succeeds another monotonously. How difficult it is to transcend a painstaking compilation of facts by an illuminating image. (Darby 1962: 2) Description may however carry other cultural possibility. As Svetlana Alpers suggested in her 1983 study of seventeenth century Dutch painting, there is a complex ‘art of describing’, Alpers seeking to recast studies of visual culture away from Italian art historic emphasis on symbolic narrative, and querying the distinction between description and narrative action: ‘northern images do not disguise meaning or hide it beneath the surface but rather show that meaning by its very nature is lodged in what the eye can take in – however deceptive that might be’ (Alpers 1983: xxiv; Wall 2006).&quot;[Matless, David *In the Nature of Landscape: Cultural Geography on the Norfolk Broads*. Wiley-Blackwell, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;From the viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have been considerably poorer without them. At a minimum, visual language deserves the same protection as verbal language. But suppose, as we have seen on more than one occasion, visual language carries more emotional power than (mere?)words. What does that say about my belief in Habermas’s ideal of a public sphere where democracy depends on continuous conversation, argumentation, and debate, all calculated to inspire, protect, and promote Enlightenment values?&quot;[Navasky, Victor S. *The Art of Controversy: Political Cartoons and Their Enduring Power*. Knopf, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Yet in the potential of a translation to built architectural form there is an unacknowledged return to the notion of form or material itself as the feminine. This is an important point to make. Grosz guides us in the discussion again: “What happens in the bifurcation of sexed bodies—which is, in my opinion, an irreducible cultural universal—that is inevitably part of our understanding of bodies?If mind or subjectivity can be adequately and without reduction explained in terms of bodies, bodies understood in their historiocultural specificity, does this mean that sexual specificity—sexual difference—will be finally understood as a necessary (even if not sufficient) condition of our subjectivity?”33 Does eliminating gender differences, as Grosz points out, play into the male model of subjectivity by eliminating a feminist position?&quot;[Flanagan, Mary, and Austin Booth *Re:skin*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;As the nature that culture uses to make second nature, mimesis cannot be outside of history, just as history cannot lie outside of the mimetic faculty. Here we take odds with the fashionable theses of construction, that nature itself is a social construction, just as we take odds with the converse, that history itself can be reduced to an essential nature. As the nature that culture uses to create second nature, mimesis chaotically jostles for elbow room in this force field of necessary contradiction and illusion, providing the 70 WITH THE WIND OF WoRLD HISTORY IN OuR SAILS glimpse of the opportunity to dismantle that second nature and reconstruct other worlds-so long as we reach a critical level of understanding of the play of primitivism within the mimetic faculty itself.&quot;[Taussig, Michael *Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses*. New  York: Routledge, 1992.]</li>
<li>&quot;In discussions of the cultural significance of the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair’s, some cultural historians have noted how the Midway Plaisance staging of ethnic living group exhibits signifies a remarkable change in the anthropological and ethnological approach to the visual display of On With the Eye of the Mind (1908) artifacts — to what we might call, following Benjamin’s lead, the “script” of human cultural history. An older approach to the visual display of objects, represented by collections housed in what were then called “cabinets of curiosities,” displaced material artifacts from their specific cultural context, catalogued them according to their function, and then arranged them on an evolutionary time line whose overall sequence essentially functioned to illustrate the increased technological sophistication in the object’s design.&quot;[Tatum, Stephen *In the Remington Moment*. University of Nebraska Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Today’s “Awesome Chasm” tour, emphasizing geologic measurements and explanations, attests to a scientiﬁc gaze deeply encrusted in public interpretations of Grand Canyon. However, like the geologic strata exposed in the canyon’s walls, the stacked volume analogy of the “Awesome Chasm” tour reveals many layers of meaning. As with any formation (geological, textual, historical, cultural), it has fault lines, cracks, and cleavages marking shifts, changes, and transformations.&quot;[Neumann, Mark, and Neumann Mark *On the Rim: Looking for the Grand Canyon*. Univ Of Minnesota Press, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;The hard material presence of the word is a husk that humiliates the missing flesh that has been torn from it and left behind as roadkill. I keep circling around linguistic questions, rather than psychological or narrative situations, because whenever I encounter language (and especially when I try to write or read) I’m aware that verbal communication itself involves humiliation. Not merely the humiliation of trying to acquire mastery of a language, or trying to use language accurately and effectively.&quot;[Koestenbaum, Wayne *Humiliation : big Ideas : small books*. New York: Picador, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Drawing on a range of familiar cultural metaphors—such as roots, branches, ways, and division into sides—houses embody Sia Raga ideas concerning ancestral history, social organization, cultural behavior, and taxonomic classification. Grasping the many meanings that are built into Sia Raga houses entails an understanding of the broader shape and texture of Sia Raga society and culture. In this way, houses share characteristics of structure with many other things: the shape of the house is also the shape of the island, of the tree, of the leaf, of the body (both individual and collective), and of the history or explanation (vevhurina).&quot;[Taylor, John Patrick *The Other Side: Ways of Being and Place in Vanuatu (Pacific Islands Monograph Series)*. 2008.]</li>
