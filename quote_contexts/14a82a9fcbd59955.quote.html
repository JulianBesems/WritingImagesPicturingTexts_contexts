<li>&quot;2010 Floor vs. ramp: SANAA&#x27;S Rolex Learning Center in Lausanne, built  as a single massive chamber with an undulating floor. The uneven  topography is an attempt to force &quot;bumping into&quot; between disciplines,  and an effort to claim an inclined surface as equally liveable and usable  as the floor. PAGE 60 FLOOR 2005 Killing floor: &quot;The blood runs so thick, at times two inches . . .  that every now and again during the production the workers have to  first sweep it away into the gutter that will take it to another part of  the factory where it is processed into animal feed etc. &quot;— Juhan Kuus,  photographer, describing Maitland abattoir in Cape Town. &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Then we would install 2-inch XPS foam boards to the floor using EcoStud’s plastic “Z”-shaped furring strip. That would take care of the moldy smell from the walls and floor. Then we added special floor drain check valves and a sump pump cover to seal off the drain system and eliminate the swampy smell. All of those efforts would also slow or stop the movement of radon into the space.&quot;[Wilson, Jeff *The Greened House Effect: Renovating Your Home with a Deep Energy Retrofit*. 2nd ed.

<li>&quot;Outside the block walls and concrete floor of my old basement there was no insulation, just good old-fashioned dirt. Heat from inside my house was rushing out of the furniture, air, interior walls, human bodies—you name it—through the floors, into the basement, and then through the highly conductive masonry surfaces of the basement walls and floor into the cool soil beyond.&quot;[Wilson, Jeff *The Greened House Effect: Renovating Your Home with a Deep Energy Retrofit*. 2nd ed.

<li>&quot;In this way the air blown into the air pushes vitiated air outwards in a natural way through the “light above” (small window above the front door), given appropriate open. Figure 3: Rate of operation and use underground spaces. The measurements made in this configuration made it possible to check the impact of the loop on the parameters of indoor comfort.&quot;[Brebbia, C. A., D. Kaliampakos, and P.

<li>&quot;The flats have upper floors formed in pre-cast concrete. A concrete floor (and its floor finish) provides better fire protection and sound insulation than the timber floor shown above. When the planks have been laid they are grouted to fill any holes or gaps. A 75mm screed forms the base for the resilient chipboard/foam finishing layer. Because the concrete floor and applied screed will contain construction moisture they are separated from the floor decking by a polythene vapour control layer.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed. Estates Gazette Ltd, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Exceptions to this would be rooms below ground level where damp could damage the timber, rooms which were likely to be wet due to their function, eg kitchens and sculleries, and some working class terraced housing built with clay block floors or stone flags. NB For more information on timber see Chapter 11- Timber-Frame Housing. The floor (often referred to as a raised timber floor or suspended floor) consists of a series of joists supported by the loadbearing walls and covered with floorboards.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;Inside it a chamber (8. 8 by 7m) is formed and a second storey once stood over it, the floor of which was supported by heavy timber beams laid transversely from north to south. The floor itself probably consisted of clayey earth laid over a bed of smaller transverse timbers and rushes. Access to the room beneath was only possible at second-storey level by means of a trap door and a ladder.&quot;[Fields, Nic, Donato Spedaliere, and Sarah Sulemsohn Spedaliere *Troy c. 1700-1250 BC*. Osprey Publishing, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;Then, a fan blows the air through equipment that adds or absorbs moisture and the supply duct to terminal units in each room, cools the air. The air is then blown by a fan where a thermostat controls the discharge into a separator equipped with a sound trap, temperature. where the air stream is divided into the primary The room terminal unit may be of the straight and secondary supply.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;Cool air is more dense than warm air.&quot;[Kelly, Lynne *The Skeptic&#x27;s Guide to the Paranormal*. Allen &amp; Unwin, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;The fact that the packing case was quite air-tight and that the metal case containing the painting was also air-tight — minimized very greatly the possibility of replacement of conditioned air by cabin air of such low humidity each time the plane landed. (At high altitudes Air transport - lower cabin pressure — packing cases &quot;exhale&quot; air - at sea level dry cabin air is &quot;inhaled&quot; into the cases thereby affecting the painting).&quot;[(Auth.), VASTA *Conservation &amp; Exhibitions*. Butterworth-Heinemann, 1987.]</li>
<li>&quot;In this configuration it was possible to make measurements with the planting of recycling and treatment of the environment on (UTA - air handling unit), which change air without conditioning.&quot;[Brebbia, C. A., D. Kaliampakos, and P. Prochazka *Underground Spaces : Design, Engineering and Environmental Aspects (Wit Transactions on the Built Environment)*. WIT Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Current ideas include the concept of local cooling through recirculating air-conditioning cabinets with the servicing for these, including pipework, within the raised floor system. Clearly, the substitution of the underfloor space as a recipient area for services instead of the suspended ceiling requires considerable forethought in the way service grids are organized and the way space capacity is incorporated.&quot;[Blanc, Alan *Internal Components*. Routledge, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;This air, if very damp, or dry relative to the case internal environment may cause damage to the contents. Air pressure differences in this way may upset the R H balance of humidity-sensitive works of art during air transits and lead to structural changes in humidity-sensitive artifacts. Air transport The changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature of air at various altitudes are shown in Figure 10. 19.&quot;[(Auth.), VASTA *Conservation &amp; Exhibitions*.

<li>&quot;Over the years, a few archaeologists have come to explore its crumbling stone buildings and pyramids. But almost no tourists visit. Some workers clear away trees and brush from the great pyramid. Others clean the floor of the temple. This floor greatly interests Ruz. All the other buildings in Palenque have stucco floors. The Temple of the Inscriptions has a flagstone floor.&quot;[Kops, Deborah *Palenque (Unearthing Ancient Worlds)*. 2008.]</li>

<li>&quot;Shallow floors are suitable for lightweight use only and can take normal general office loading of 2. 5 kN/m2 ; heavy equipment, such as safes. large computers and bulk storage, need special consideration. The use of high-grade panels and jacks • a large proportion of the floor needs to be accessible; • services need to be routed across deep-plan buildings; • the floor void serves as a plenum for heating and ventilation.&quot;[Blanc, Alan *Internal Components*. Routledge, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;In an enclosed room, this therefore results in different air temperatures, with a layer of warmer air at the top and cooler air below. Objects create an obstacle to the flow of air, splitting up the current of air as it flows past (fig. A 1. 20). Besides creating turbulence, this also leads to higher air pressure on the windward side of the building and lower relative pressure (suction) on the leeward side.&quot;[Herzog, Thomas *Facade Construction Manual*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;The walls are a large “plane. ” The sofa is a large “plane. ” The floor coverings and floor are large planes. My apartment might be a fun example to analyze . . . Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor. The walls pull from the white in the floor—a quiet “plane” in contrast with the “pop” of the painted floors.&quot;[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy &amp; broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*.
