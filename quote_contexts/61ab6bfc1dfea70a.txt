--- Context List ---
01. "*The interac-tion between modes is itself a part of the production of meaning.* — **!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=269&annotation=3Y7VZBZB)"

02. "*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&annotation=WA8NIH6S)"

03. "*In this section, I propose to encode different modalities from the collected data and transform its rendering: images, text, sound, movies into numerical representations that machines can read.* [Saldana_FP_190902.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBPXTCVK?page=14&annotation=6XBEEAUU)"

04. "*There is a large body of multimodal research that explores the dynamics of the interaction between image and language.* — **Interesting but to me it seems to fall into the same pitfalls where meaning is seen as a singularly defined unifying mapping of the modalities. However this fails to acknowledge that the modalities need to remain in their domain to bear this meaning. This collapsing them and studying them by means of analysing meaning seems odd to me. However further and closer reading is needed.

Primary argument is that our approach is an active one where it navigates domains to put something forward which inherently relies on a different approach where this research is employing an analytical method to study how understanding is derived from multimodal sources . (Analysis vs Algebra?)** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=275&annotation=7RJ5TVJQ)"

05. "*Movies might be a good illustration to the kind of stabilities to be established when describing the actual cultural constitution of our BoT: to start with, Shakespeare’s Renaissance theater unhooks the play from the animated medieval humans, and stages them anywhere and anywhen as self-reflections, i. e. as projections of animated, contemplated reflections. The observer’s vantage point is necessarily outside of the animated, cosmic order of necessities. He is expelled from the medieval order, puts all the plays into his pocket, and projects himself as not the other plays. Explicates his play, creates a certain mask, takes on a personality, acts politically.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt & Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=47&annotation=QZAKRXG3)"

06. "*The point-by-point correspondence of the solid volume and its delineation, ichnography or scenography, makes the latter a characteristic or a language; conversely, language establishes a correspondence of the same type as the painting - one then understands the deformations and avatars of the former, if one observes that the projection can be made on a left surface, or 'humpbacked'.* — **Very relevant!!!!!** [02.a. en (gpt) _premier chapitre_ deuxième partie [Serres, Michael_Le système de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2W5WUQWU?page=7&annotation=EDC3Y77T)"

07. "*The second assumption central to multi-modal research is that all modes have, like language, been shaped through their cultural, historical and social uses to realize social functions as required by different communi-ties.* [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=268&annotation=ADV42UQ8)"

08. "*or whoe ver sees it, the calli gram does not say, cannot yet say : This is a fower, this is a bird. It is still too much trapped within shape, too much subject to representation by resemblance, to formulate such a prop osition* — **Again can be used one to one for single domain embedding of text and image** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=36&annotation=WVLMIX2F)"

09. "*Under the guise of reverting to a previous arrangement, it recovers its three functions-but in order to pervert them, there­ by disturbing all the traditional bonds oflanguage and the image.* — **This exactly expresses how text and image cannot in all situations be expressed in the same encoding. Because this subversion is only possible because image and text stand to each others proportion but not in one another's encoding.** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=34&annotation=SDLNYAT5)"

10. "*Therefore, such invariance is available for mediating between masterpieces.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt & Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=40&annotation=4M7KHB5E)"
