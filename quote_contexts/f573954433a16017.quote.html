    <pre>4.1.2 WALL How the lapse of time affects ownership and usage of the wall. Hanging loosely, perhaps flapping, the woven screen generates- and, crucially, symbolizes - the division and organization of activities within the primitive dwelling. The woven &quot;wall&quot; is an enabler of civilization; the thick structural wall merely a defender of it.The hanging wall has an apparent descent compared to the foot wall. He argued that structure is there within the wall, but the importance of the wall is the visible spatial enclosure. As thin as possible: fantasy of the two-dimensional wall, sketched in 3D by SANAA for the Kunstlinie Almere, Netherlands. The meaning of the wall is just as diverse as the uses of vertical surface can be, but there are at least two essential functions: providing structure and dividing space. Practically, however, the two modes of action are always in some sort united. The signicance of a walls threshold qualities notwithstanding, a wall is empirically also a screen, or cover;

<em>The screen&#x27;s function as a divider of space is also closely tied to its ability to filter light and shadow. In this way, the woven wall not only creates a physical separation but also manipulates the visual environment within the dwelling. By admitting and rejecting various intensities of light, it establishes a dynamic interplay between the interior and exterior worlds. The threshold quality of the wall, once again, is underscored by its role in mediating the transition between these two realms. As a result, the wall&#x27;s significance extends far beyond its structural or aesthetic functions, encompassing a broader cultural and symbolic dimension.  |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant|&gt; |assistant</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;The signiﬁcance of a wall’s threshold qualities notwithstanding, a wall is empirically also a screen, or cover; a function of particular importance to medieval and premodern urban Arab-Muslim culture, with its traditional enclaustration and veiling of women.&quot;[O&#x27;Meara, Simon *Space and Muslim Urban Life: At the Limits of the Labyrinth of Fez (Culture and Civilization in the Middle East)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;PAGE 20 WOVEN WALL The ur-wall is not, according to  19th century architectural theorist  Gottfried Semper, a mud or stone  line of enormous and reassuring  heft, but an artful, woven partition.  Hanging loosely, perhaps flapping,  the woven screen generates-   and, crucially, symbolizes -   the division and organization of  activities within the primitive dwelling. The woven &quot;wall&quot; is an enabler  of civilization; the thick structural  wall merely a defender of it. &quot;[INPUT: wall.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;wall 2001 As thin as possible: fantasy of the  two-dimensional wall, sketched in 3D by  SANAA for the Kunstlinie Almere,  Netherlands. PAGE 3 WALL The meaning of the wall is just as diverse as the uses of vertical surface can be, but there are at least two essential  functions: providing structure and dividing space. The two can be separated, and thus the category of &#x27;wall&#x27; divides into  two: the bearing wall, separating roof from ground; and the partition wall, organizing movement within the resulting  container. The former, it would seem, is as stable as the human need for shelter; the latter as changeable as our forms  of sociability. &quot;[INPUT: wall.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;In the context of this chapter, shaping a wall in plan presents opportunities for architectural enrichment, as illustrated at the Mönchengladbach Museum. Highly regarded for the qualities of its interior spaces and urban setting, an exterior gallery wall undulates (Fig. 4. 10). The sinuous wall imbues one gallery interior with special character and outside, the wall’s serpentine geometry appears as a natural extension of the curvilinear paths and brick walls that lead up the hillside to the museum.&quot;[Charleson, Andrew *Structure As Architecture: A Source Book For Architects And Structural Engineers*.

<li>&quot;As such, these balconies acknowledge the purposes fulﬁlled by apertures in traditional (thick) wall construction but in this case with thin, lightweight, and industrialized elements. Ironically, this incorporates aspects of the vertical window into its opposite; inhabitable space has been reinterpreted through an assembly of lightweight elements. This “wall” can be seen as inﬁll, window wall, and uniform plane.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Inside the chapel, the roof support is revealed. Thirty-six regularly spaced square posts are set out from the interior plywood wall-lining (Fig. 6. 4). Each connects delicately to the wall by three steel pins. The simple move of withdrawing the posts from their conventional location within the walls and exposing them affects the interior enormously. Acting as visual markers, they modulate the wall surface, but also increase the shape definition of the interior space and accentuate a sense of enclosure by their continuous alignment with the roof ribs they support.&quot;[Charleson, Andrew *Structure As Architecture: A Source Book For Architects And Structural Engineers*. Architectural Press, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Before the widespread use of frame construction, requirements for light, ventilation, and views outside the building were met with apertures, built as openings in a wall. The limits of these openings afﬁrmed the wall’s tectonic and theoretical primacy. The frame changed all of that: windows ceased being openings in walls and became walls themselves. But when this occurred, the wall’s non-load-bearing functions had to be reconsidered.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;1994:150, fig. 3). In Building 700 at Tall Jawa, a stone pier wall supports one end of a lintel over a doorway between Rooms 712 and R713 (see below). This same construction technique was used at Busayra, where a “pier” wall (90) bonds with the outer wall, and serves as a cross wall between two rooms (Bienkowki 2001: fig. 3; 2002: fig. 4. 5). While this technique is also used in casemate wall systems, what is of interest here is its use in domestic structures.&quot;[Daviau, P. M. Michele, Paul-Eugene Dion, Ronald G. V.

<li>&quot;To the interior, smooth wall inside-surfaces create pure interior space, while to the city, smooth wall outside-surfaces definite clear open spaces. So the designer abandoned all decoration on both sides of wall, try to create the atmosphere of pure spaces, in order to highlight the art works at the same time.&quot;[Yu, Jasmine *Museum Display Design*.

<li>&quot;This necropolis, brought to near artistic perfection by its builders and craftsmen, is the famous “Saadien Tombs,” sealed off from view until the early-twentieth century. Nowadays indissociable from the qibla wall, the mihrab is commonly a mosque’s most ornate element, located neither before nor behind the qibla wall, but within it. 23 Most frequently in the form of a recessed, arcuated niche, the mihrab is thought by some to signify an absent presence: that of the Prophet as Imam. 24 Ambiguous, because presence and absence at once co-exist, this signiﬁcation draws upon the mihrab’s location within the liminal, equally ambiguous qibla wall. 25 An alternative signiﬁcation, as proposed by Clevenot again, is that of a door inviting the believer to traverse the wall and pass beyond immediate reality. 26 This interpretation, too, draws upon the mihrab’s location within qibla wall, for without the wall, there would be no door for traversal.&quot;[O&#x27;Meara, Simon *Space and Muslim Urban Life: At the Limits of the Labyrinth of Fez (Culture and Civilization in the Middle East)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;9. 3, above). The same construction technique may have been used in east-west Wall 9022 that separates Rooms 906 and R907. Wall 9022 was cut on the east by Doorway N to provide access to Room 906 after Doorway H, in Wall 9024, had been blocked. Doorway N was subsequently filled with fallen wall stones distorting the appearance of Wall 9022. Partition Wall 9023 is a new feature in Stratum VIIA (Fig.&quot;[Daviau, P. M.

<li>&quot;Wall washing or grazing is the use of lights to emphasize a textured surface, such as stucco, stone, or brick. Simple uplighting played on a painted wall can add mood to the room even when the wall doesn’t have much texture. Recessed low-voltage fixtures with halogen lamps cast a bright, sharply contrasting light without being obvious themselves. But accent lighting also can come in the form of low-profile fluorescent tubes set into shallow recesses beneath a mirror or even under a vanity.&quot;[Works, Word *New bathroom ideas that work*.

<li>&quot;The long wall is unstable, moving the viewer from the door to the stairs, from the entrance to the exit, and vice versa. It half-frames a space of which the other half is implied—a space which The Burghers of Calais command. Creating the apse that frames The Gates of Hell, the shorter wall is more stable. While the long wall suggests a deformed circular plan of which only one half is marked, the short wall reads as the missing half, morphed or shrunk: a frame.&quot;[Gandelsonas, Mario, Kohn Pederson Fox, and Ruth Butler *The Rodin Museum, Seoul*.

At the bottom portion of this wall is a bookcase, a low horizontal wood unit measuring approximately 1. 12 meters high by 5 meters in length, sheathed with sliding glass doors.
