Inspired by Miro Roman's exploration of informational architectonics in *Play Among Books*, this method extends beyond textual constellations to include visual material, rendering image and text as epistemically distinct but interrelated fields, and thus re-situating the multimodal gap as an opportunity for proportion rather than a technical flaw. The selected multi-modal datasets are comprised of media where image and text are co-present but not inherently descriptive of one another. Other datasets form the larger generic context through which the multi-modal casts are viewed.", "suggested_query": "", "suggest_context": ""}
