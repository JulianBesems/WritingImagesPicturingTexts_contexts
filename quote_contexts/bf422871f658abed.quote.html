    <pre>In the introduction we will first discuss where exactly this thesis, that explicitly doesn&#x27;t interact with architectural information per-se, situates itself within the architectural, and how it hopes to be relevant to the broader discipline of architecture. For this we will first discuss the variety of information architects historically engage with, and how these are currently hosted within the digital, in terms of encoding and interaction. Although we will be critical to some current phenomena, this is not necessarily to say that they are wrong, or inherently problematic, the critique is more a positioning in terms of what might be added, and where the gaps are in the current way of architectural thinking within the digital. If computers are able to facilitate the architectural aspects we discuss, then where can architecture turn to computers to extend what it does?</pre>

      <li>&quot;Printing and the advent of comparative linguistics were far from the sole challenges to architecture’s cultural significance, but the questions of means and meaning inherent to these two metaphors touch on the most pressing issues that architects faced then, and still struggle with today. Cockerell’s conception of ornaments effectively challenges the static interpretation of these metaphors, and this chapter traces how a passive reading of the building as text can lead to an active experience mediated by the building’s ornaments at work.&quot;[Bordeleau, Anne *Charles Robert Cockerell, Architect in Time: Reflections Around Anachronistic Drawings*. New edition. Ashgate Pub Co, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Beyond the consideration of architecture itself as a representation – the petrifaction of historical time – it is imperative to foreground the multi-dimensional interplay between time and architecture in order to challenge the current emphasis on the self-referencing of both architecture and subject. Responding to Baudelaire’s belief that ‘La forme d’une ville change, hélas, plus vite que le coeur d’un mortel’,14 it has been argued that architecture is asked to hold time not by its supposed stability, but by building time itself. 15 This points to a renewed definition of the epistemological dimension of architecture.&quot;[Bordeleau, Anne *Charles Robert Cockerell, Architect in Time: Reflections Around Anachronistic Drawings*. New edition. Ashgate Pub Co, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Indeed, Cockerell considered ornaments to be the foil through which architecture communicated its motives. While much has changed in the past 200 years, contemporary architects can gain great insights from a better comprehension of nineteenth-century approaches to the already shifting relation between architecture, time, and history. This book stems from the consideration of the contemporary situation of architecture. In the past 30 years, the conditions that led to the advent of postmodernism, and the lingering difficulty of qualifying contemporary architecture as modern, supermodern, hyper-modern or simply late-modern have brought to the fore some fundamental questions in relation to architecture’s relation to time.&quot;[Bordeleau, Anne *Charles Robert Cockerell, Architect in Time: Reflections Around Anachronistic Drawings*. New edition. Ashgate Pub Co, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;The Marxist architectural historian Manfredo Tafuri even named “viscosity” as the reason that architecture successfully infitrated, in the late twentieth century, a conservation discourse once dominated by painterly concepts. 21 This shift provides an apt heuristic for thinking more broadly about how architecture’s historical depth—or its capacity as a medium for storing history—has changed in the international imagination since the 1970s. Keeping this notion of viscosity in mind, I want to briefly outline four ways that politics, technology, and aesthetics intersect in global preservation practice today.&quot;[Allais, Lucia *Designs of Destruction: The Making of Monuments in the Twentieth Century*. University of Chicago Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;Contrary to the tendency to treat ephemeral architecture as a derivative from solid, built architecture, it is precisely in the ephemeral world of paper architecture that fundamental issues about buildings and their viewers, the classical and the modern, past and present were acted out. Note 1 The research on which this chapter is based was funded very generously by the Dutch Foundation for Scientific Research (NWO). Bibliography Alberti, L. B. (1992)The Art of Building in Ten Books, introduction, translation and notes by N. Leach, J. Rykwert and R. Tavernor.&quot;[Macy, C. *Festival Architecture (The Classical Tradition in Architecture)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;This research suggests that ephemeral architecture and its reproduction in word and image offer a privileged view into the very mechanisms that define baroque art and architecture, and the intentions or agendas underlying these strategies. Anthony Blunt, for instance, has argued that the artistic practices of seventeenth-century Rome are deeply preoccupied with illusionism in the service of the communication of divine mysteries (Blunt 1978). Festival architecture, then, seems to push to its limit the research into the artistic means best suited to communicate such higher truths.&quot;[Macy, C. *Festival Architecture (The Classical Tradition in Architecture)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;The emergence of architecture as a professional class seems to have at least some relationship to emergent complexities themselves. One hundred fifty years ago, it was the requirement of literacy that could distinguish an architect from a common mason. 5 In more recent history, it was a literacy in complex code and building systems that could distinguish the architect from his associates in the building trades. When technology surges, the role of the architect is validated. The last twenty-five years stand as an exception to the historical rule.&quot;[Cesal, Eric J. *Down Detour Road: An Architect in Search of Practice*. The MIT Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The idea of &quot;architecture for architecture&#x27;s sake&quot; that we hear from Hans Hollein and Arata Isozaki has much in common with this logoscentrism. The architecture with a capital &quot;A&quot; that Isozaki advocates, architecture as form, Noam Chomsky&#x27;S deep linguistic structure and universal grammar are all examples of logos-centrism and the universality that characterized the age of the machine.&quot;[Kurokawa, Kisho *The Philosophy of Symbiosis*. 2nd. 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;Looking at Henry Wotton’s treatise Elements of Architecture and the masque designs of Inigo Jones, she explores the concepts that viewers of that time may have used to understand such architecture. The important aspect, she suggests, for a seventeenth-century audience was that these works represented a view of architecture as politics by another means. In other words, they employed the classical rhetorical view of art not as an object of enjoyment for its own sake, but as a means of persuasion. Maarten Delbeke’s essay tests the hypothesis that ephemeral architecture contributes to the signification and subsequent reception of permanent architecture.&quot;[Macy, C. *Festival Architecture (The Classical Tradition in Architecture)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Yet, the debates on architecture were not just about architecture. While matters of material construction, design, the social and political functions of buildings, and spatial/territorial planning provided the impetus and focus for debates, they also referenced profoundly symbolic visions of wider social, political, cultural, and anthropological transformation (Marziliano 2010: 23–5). Architectural debates in Fascist Italy were rich in theoretical substance, sweeping in visionary terms, and invested with an epochal significance that transcended their professional context.&quot;[(auth.), Aristotle Kallis *The Third Rome, 1922–1943: The Making of the Fascist Capital*. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is easy to see that Postmodern Architecture will evolve as an architecture of minor cultures, of heterogeneous cultures, an architecture of deconstruction that seeks to reintroduce noise, an architecture that sets itself off-center. In this sense, Postmodern Architecture is often an architecture of melange, with tendencies toward hybridization. But this hybridization if fundamentally different from the hybrid style that simply mixes together historical architectural style of the past. Since there is no single ideal architecture, no correct order, architecture does not express a single system of values.&quot;[Kurokawa, Kisho *The Philosophy of Symbiosis*. 2nd. 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;Even the superlightness of the Eames House undermines the figure of the heroic architect. Its delicacy, even indeterminacy, facilitates the slippage from solid object to flickering ephemeral image. Architecture as building gives way to architecture as crafted image. This does not mean leaving material construction behind; on the contrary, the Eameses were expert craftspeople, shaping the structure into an image and images into structure.&quot;[Colomina, Beatriz *Domesticity at War*. The MIT Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Will = Text; Toward the Evocation of Meaning I have noted how Modern Architecture, as a Modern epistemology, is deeply rooted in Western dominance and logos. If we are to move on to Postmodern Architecture, which asks ontological and semantic questions in its attempt to create an evocation of meaning, how must we transform the design methods of Modern Architecture?The basis for the design methods of Modern Architecture up to now has been the a priori assumption of an ideal image of architecture (an order) which is single and universal.&quot;[Kurokawa, Kisho *The Philosophy of Symbiosis*. 2nd. 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;Architects themselves, however, carry vague definitions of the term. Phenomena like the division between design architects and architects of record only serve to perpetuate the problem of defining architecture. Bernard Tschumi calls this split the “Third Dissociation,” and opines that the split is disconcerting because it is part of “an historical evolution where the architect becomes more and more distanced from the forces that govern the production of buildings today. ”1 The Named Architect 175 Another significant fissure is that between built architecture and “paper” architecture.&quot;[Cesal, Eric J. *Down Detour Road: An Architect in Search of Practice*. The MIT Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Deconstructivism reveled The Citizen Architect 193 in it and used this freedom to explore new formal directions. The Nietzschean philosophical constructs that underpin deconstructivism reinforced the idea that architecture was an individual exploration done for its own sake. This thinking renders architecture a cultural chamber of echoes—a series of tautological exercises whose only aim seems to be advancing itself critically. A discussion, as it were, about architecture and culture, conducted between architects but in buildings rather than words.&quot;[Cesal, Eric J. *Down Detour Road: An Architect in Search of Practice*. The MIT Press, 2010.]</li>
