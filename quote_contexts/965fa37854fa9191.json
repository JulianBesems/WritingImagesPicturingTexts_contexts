{"created_at": 1765128137.077709, "confirmed": true, "origin": "searched", "search_input": "", "suggested_query": "By exploring the intersection of architecture and computers, we hope to uncover new possibilities for the discipline, and to challenge its current boundaries. In doing so, we will not only examine the ways in which computers are currently being used in architectural practice, but also consider the potential for computers to be used as a tool for architectural design, and the implications this may have for the role of the architect.", "suggest_context": "1 INTRODUCTION In the introduction we will first discuss where exactly this thesis, that explicitly doesn't interact with architectural information per-se, situates itself within the architectural, and how it hopes to be relevant to the broader discipline of architecture. For this we will first discuss the variety of information architects historically engage with, and how these are currently hosted within the digital, in terms of encoding and interaction. Although we will be critical to some current phenomena, this is not necessarily to say that they are wrong, or inherently problematic, the critique is more a positioning in terms of what might be added, and where the gaps are in the current way of architectural thinking within the digital. If computers are able to facilitate the architectural aspects we discuss, then where can architecture turn to computers to extend what it does?"}
