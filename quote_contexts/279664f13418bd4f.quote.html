    <pre>A simple example clarifies the difference between a collection of points and a structure of actions. The integers mathbbZ, taken with addition, form a group: the identity element 0 and additive inverses belong to the structure, and addition acts as translation: linear displacement along a domain. Likewise, the non-zero rationals mathbbQ, taken with multiplication, form a group: multiplication composes scalings and provides multiplicative inverses. The point is not the examples themselves, but that a mathematical object is never only what is it; it is also what can be done. This becomes especially visible in the relation between the real plane and the complex numbers. The set of complex numbers mathbbC can be visualised as a two-dimensional plane mathbbR2, mapping the real and imaginary components as coordinates. Under an object-geometry optic, this identification appears to settle the matter: complex numbers are just points in a plane. Yet once complex multiplication is taken as the relevant operation, the coordinate picture no longer shows what matters. Addition remains translation, but multiplication acts as a change of frame: scaling and rotation; inversion generates singularities; phase and magnitude become structural. In that sense, what aligns geometrically becomes insufficient operationally. A phase plot does not depict content but the behaviour of an operation: how a function displaces domains and codomains through its own internal structure. Fig. 2.4:1 depicts the phase diagram for the complex equation AZ  dfrac1Zi2  dfrac1Z-42  dfrac1Z2, Z in mathbbC  Figure 2.4:1 - Phase plot of a complex function This is more than analogy. It signals a condition relevant to architecture: when domains of architectural communication are treated merely as sets of information to be aligned or translated, their operative capacity is lost. Treating them operationally means understanding how each mode reshapes the interpretive field of another; how a section reconfigures a plan, how a perspective drawing projects a spatial logic without resolving it. Machine learning models, especially cross-modal ones like CLIP, tend to treat modalities as data to be aligned in a shared space. But what this produces is rarely a reversible correspondence. Although the training pairs are presented as one-to-one, the learned relation is better understood as a field of probabilistic association: a single image can plausibly support many captions, and a caption can plausibly support many images. Retrieval itself introduces an operator nearest neighbours, top-k ranking, thresholding, but it does not yield an inverse in the mathematical sense; it stages a contingent passage. This irreversibility is not a flaw; it is a sign that we are dealing with something more complex than a set of equivalents. Architectural modalities function similarly: they are not mirrors, but projections. They require a framework that accounts for how representations interact, not how they match. This is what an operational understanding of multimodality offers. It invites a shift from translation to projection, from matching to modulation.

<em>In this way, the operative capacity of architectural modalities is not about establishing a one-to-one correspondence between different forms of representation, but about understanding how each modality reshapes the interpretive field of another. For instance, a floor plan can reconfigure a section, which in turn reconfigures a perspective drawing. This is not a matter of alignment, but of how each representation projects its own logic onto others. In this sense, multimodality is not about combining different modes of representation, but about understanding how each mode modulates the others. This is what an operational understanding of multimodality offers: a framework for accounting for how representations interact, rather than how they match.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Not all forms of representation submit to this form of integration. But if models are not like axiomatic systems, what are they like?Consider, as an alternative, two other paradigmatic forms of representation: pictures and maps. A picture is always a picture from a particular perspective, taken through a particular lens, in particular lighting conditions, and so on. We can assemble many photos and drawings of the same object from different angles, at different resolutions, in different lighting, on different scales, and on different types of film.&quot;[Horst, Steven *Laws, Mind, and Free Will*. The MIT Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;CONCLUSION Abstraction, re-presentation, reflection, and conscious conceptualization interact on various levels of mental operating. In the course of these processes, what was 194 ABSTRACTION, RE-PRESENTATION, AND REFLECTION produced by one cycle of operations, can be taken as ‘given content’ by the next one, which may then coordinate it to create a new ‘form’, a new structure; and any such structure can be consciously conceptualized and associated with a symbol. The structure that then functions as the symbol’s meaning for the particular cognizing subject, may have gone through several cycles of abstraction and reorganization.&quot;[von Glasersfeld, Ernst *Key Works in Radical Constructivism*. Sense Publishers, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;260-264). These methods come from a kind of predicative knowledge of course &quot;exogenous&quot; to the mere diagrammatic representation: generalization is not a possible product of the pure diagrammatic understanding. For instance, one suggestion is to break the problem into cases, to individuate a &quot;representative&quot; instance for each case, and to demonstrate that this conclusion holds for each of these instances. 23 Another one is to exploit the simulative aspects of constructions by &quot;running experiments&quot; that show how some parts of a diagram co-vary with changes in others: the observation of the interaction of the diagrams parts as one property is varied allows us to grasp and understand the &quot;universal&quot; value of some geometric relations and results (for example congruency theorem, asymptotic behaviors, periodic relations, and some symmetric relations).&quot;[(auth.), Lorenzo Magnani *Philosophy and Geometry: Theoretical and Historical Issues*.

<li>&quot;2 and 4, for a detailed jtLxtaposition and analytic comparison of depictive (&#x27;diagrammatic&#x27;) and textual (&#x27;sentential&#x27;) modes of thought from a cognitive science perspective. NOTES TO CHAPTER FOUR 143 4 Two remarks.

<li>&quot;Presumably the study of &quot;real&quot; organisms is just one of these; whether the other diagrams are equally real (i. e. , whether we can realize biological organization with novel physicochemical structures), or whether other such diagrams are excluded on some kind of physical grounds, is an open question. This formalism applies equally well to other kinds of organization, even nondynamical ones like linguistics. Here we can assume that there is only one set Ro(A) of realizations of the set A, comprising the linguistic &quot;atoms&quot; (morphemes or phonemes), and only one rule of juxtaposition leading to the set Roo#(A) of linear sequences of linguistic atoms.&quot;[(auth.), George J.

<li>&quot;The old configuration is deconstructed and refigured within a new one, rather than uncritically abandoned in the process. In this sense, one can speak of a rigorous or critical suspension of the preceding configuration or system in juxtaposition to an uncritical negation or unproblematized reversal. Derrida pursues precisely this type of project and this set of strategies, strategically &quot;conserving] the old name,&quot; the subordinate name, &quot;writing&quot; for his new concept (Margins, 329; Marges, 392).&quot;[Plotnitsky, Arkady *In the Shadow of Hegel: Complementarity, History, and the Unconscious*. University Press of Florida, 1993.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, psychological factors play a minor role in the transition from one kind of conceptual preforming to another. The main reason why it is impossible to apply different conceptual systems in one cognitive situation is epistemic and to some extent logical, not psychological: if we accepted more than one conceptual system — and in effect true propositions expressed in different systems — in one cognitive situation, we would be unable to reveal the investigated field of world as it is.&quot;[Czarnocka, Małgorzata *A Path to a Conception of Symbolic Truth*. Peter Lang Gmbh, Internationaler Verlag Der Wissenschaften, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Second, the very division of Logique de la sensation into two volumes— one just of Deleuze&#x27;s commentary, one just of Bacon&#x27;s paintings—sets up the tension of image and concept and yet suggests ways to overcome the developing of that tension into an irreconcilable split. How can one, on the one hand, argue that all aesthetic practices participate in a common activity of force and sensation and, on the other hand, still respect the material and formal specificity of each art?This is a question that has vexed theorists.&quot;[(ed.), Gary Genosko *Deleuze and Guattari: Critical Assessments of Leading Philosophers.

<li>&quot;Moreover, each interaction has to be analyzed separately: different discourses become attracted to different aspects of chaos. • Pragmatic theories of metaphors highlight the importance of a new term having to be processed in the importing discourse in order to make sense. In any discourse outside of physics, one may expect the integration of chaos into the existing corpus of knowledge to differ. MET APHORS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES 217 • Constructivist theories focus on the effect that once a tenn has been successfully integrated into one discourse, it stimulates further applications.&quot;[(ed.), Fernand Hallyn *Metaphor and Analogy in the Sciences*.

<li>&quot;the same course of actually given sense- and imagecontents serves as a basis for the same ‘conception’ or ‘interpretation’, in which the appearance of the object with the properties presented by those contents is constituted for us. But the same appearance sustains different acts in the two cases. (LU ii/2 131; LI i 339)† That explains why the same intuitive given may be ‘on one occasion directly meant as that thing there, on another occasion as sustaining a universal’ (LU ii/2 131; LI i 357). ‘One and the same sensuous intuition can on one occasion serve as a basis for all these modes of conceiving’ (LU ii/2 131; LI i 357).&quot;[Ricoeur, Paul, and John B. Thompson *Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences: Essays on Language, Action and Interpretation*. Reissue. Cambridge University Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;This brief but important digression allows us to get a better grip on the parallel between form and structure. Both compose with another element—matter and content, respectively—to yield a certain kind of object. More precisely, the mathematical case (as do the linguistic and musical) shows the structurecontent relation just to be an instance of the more general form-matter relation. The matter of a quadratic equation is not literal matter as in the case of gold, but neither is this way of speaking in the mathematical case mere metaphor.&quot;[(ed.), Daniel D. Novotný, and Lukás Novák (ed.) *Neo-Aristotelian Perspectives in Metaphysics*. Routledge, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;In Badiou’s terms, it is the sense of a situation rather than the counting-for-one that establishes it. In Whitehead’s terms, it is a prehensive capability. In Husserl’s terms, it is noesis divorced of consciousness, cogitation, intention, and other accidents of human reasoning. In Lingis’s terms, it is the inner formula by which a thing invites its exploration. Since objects are all fundamentally different from one another, each one has its own approach, its own logic of sense making, and through Alien Phenomenology [ 29 ] this relation they trace the real reality of another, just as the radiation around an event horizon helps an astronomer deduce the nature of a black hole. 67 “Unit operation” names the logics by which objects perceive and engage their worlds.&quot;[Bogost, Ian *Alien Phenomenology, or What It&#x27;s Like to Be a Thing*.

<li>&quot;The problem of the theory-ladenness of scientific observation is not whether one uses a semantic network in making an observationfor that one always doesnor whether the semantic network one uses is a scientific one, but whether in the making of a scientific observation, the mediation of instruments is compatible with a direct act of perception. To this question I have already answered, Yes!On the one hand, the phenomenology and semantics of scientific observation give support to this view, and on the other hand, the interpretative character of perception explains how this is possible, and provides criteriaamong them, hermeneutical criteriafor the testing of disputed claims.&quot;[Neville, Robert C. *New Essays in Metaphysics*.

<li>&quot;A topological map is better than a topographic map for getting from one subway stop to another, but worse for an overland trek on foot. One cannot simply lay transparencies of various maps of, say, Boston (figure 6. 2) on top of one another and have “the” map of the city. Rather, one has to know how to move from one map to another, and how to coordinate the Laws and Idealization 71 knowledge afforded by each map with the knowledge afforded by the others. Scientific models are not exactly like either pictures or maps.&quot;[Horst, Steven *Laws, Mind, and Free Will*. The MIT Press, 2011.]</li>
