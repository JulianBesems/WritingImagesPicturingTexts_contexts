    <pre>Evans’s polarity, corporeal involvement versus disembodied abstraction, maps neatly onto our contemporary dilemma . The profession has excelled at the first (the tangible model and its deliverables), while the second (abstraction as mediating intelligence) remains under-instrumentalised in computational practice. The challenge, then, is not to abandon the body of architecture but to recover its disembodied capacities as operations that relate unlike domains such as drawing, narrative, atmosphere, code, without collapsing them into sameness. Therefore the thinking of architectural modes of media is proposed to be brought into the computational before we can consider it being returned onto architecture itself.</pre>

      <li>&quot;Our language is so permeated with consequences of theories which have divided the body and mind from each other, making separate existential realms out of them, that we lack words to designate the actual existential fact. The circumlocutions we are compelled to resort to—exemplified in the previous discussion—thus induce us to think that analogous separations exist in nature, which can also only be got around by elaborate circuitous arrangements. But body-mind simply designates what actually takes place when a living body is implicated in situations of discourse, communication and participation. In the hyphenated phrase body-mind, “body” designates the continued and conserved, the registered and cumulative operation of factors continuous with the rest of nature, inanimate as well as animate; while “mind” designates the characters and consequences which are differential, indicative of features which emerge when “body” is engaged in a wider, more complex and interdependent situation. . .&quot;[Classic philosophical questions, Mulvaney, Robert J., 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;From the start I can apprehend the concept of body analytically through the characters of extension, impenetrability, figure, etc. , all of which are thought in the concept. Now, however, looking back on the experience from which I have derived this concept of body, and finding weight to be invariably connected with the above characters, I attach it as a predicate to the concept; and in doing so I attach it synthetically, and am therefore extending my knowledge.&quot;[Classic philosophical questions, Mulvaney, Robert J., 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;If these conceptions overstep experience, their employment is termed “transcendent,” which must be distinguished from the immanent use, that is, use restricted to experience. All misunderstandings of this kind have been sufficiently guarded against in the work itself, but my reviewer found his advantage in misunderstanding me. 374 846 375 376 IMMANUEL KANT the appearances it contains, is, together with its determinations, known to us only by means of experience or perception. I, on the contrary, prove in the first place that space (and also time, which Berkeley did not consider) and all its a priori determinations can be known by us, because, no less than time, it inheres in us as a pure form of our sensibility before all perception or experience and makes all intuition of the form, and therefore all appearances, possible.&quot;[Philosophic Classics: From Plato to Derrida, Forrest E. Baird, 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;The necessary things are to point out the existence of such a curve and the need for seeking similar curves of union throughout the whole body. The draughtsman incapable of applying such a doctrine to each particular case is devoid of the essential sense of rhythmic cohesion without which he can never become anartist. I must, however, call special attention to a point already mentioned, namely that such a curve is neither necessarily superficial nor is it necessarily profound, placed inside the body.&quot;[The art and craft of drawing, Vernon Blake, 1927]</li>
<li>&quot;The judgment, “Air is elastic,” becomes universally valid and a judgment of experience only because certain judgments precede it which subsume the intuition of air under the concept of cause and effect; and they thereby determine the perceptions, not merely with respect to one another in me, but with respect to the form of judging in general (which is here hypothetical), and in this way they render the empirical judgment universally valid. If all our synthetical judgments are analyzed so far as they are objectively valid, it will be found that they never consist of mere intuitions connected only (as is commonly believed) by comparison into a judgment; but that they would be impossible were not a pure concept of the understanding superadded to the concepts abstracted from intuition, under which concept these latter are subsumed and in this manner only combined into an objectively valid judgment.&quot;[Philosophic Classics: From Plato to Derrida, Forrest E. Baird, 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;For these are mere representations; and the parts exist merely in their representation, consequently in the division—that is, in a possible experience in which they are given— and the division reaches only as far as the possible experience reaches. To assume that an appearance, for example, that of body, contains in itself before all experience all the parts which any possible experience can ever reach is to impute to a mere appearance, which can exist only in experience, an existence previous to experience.&quot;[Philosophic Classics: From Plato to Derrida, Forrest E. Baird, 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;For nature is properly the only object presented to us, in regard to which reason requires regulative principles. Nature is twofold—thinking and corporeal nature. To cogitate the latter in regard to its internal possibility, that is, to determine the application of the categories to it, no idea is required—no representation which transcends experience. In this sphere, therefore, an idea is impossible, sensuous intuition being our only guide; while, in the sphere of psychology, we require the fundamental idea (I), which contains a priori a certain form of thought, namely, the unity of the Ego.&quot;[Historical introduction to philosophy, Hakim, Albert, 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;As an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries—not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer. For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer’s gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise.&quot;[Philosophic Classics: From Plato to Derrida, Forrest E. Baird, 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;Such a priori origin is manifest in certain concepts, no less than in judgments. If we remove from our empirical concept of a body, one by one, every feature in it which is [merely] empirical, the colour, the hardness or softness, the weight, even the impenetrability, there still remains the space which the body (now entirely vanished) occupied, and this cannot be removed. Again, if we remove from our empirical concept of any object, corporeal or incorporeal, all properties which experience has taught us, we yet cannot take away that property through which the object is thought as substance or as inhering in a substance (although this concept of substance is more determinate than that of an object in general).&quot;[Classic philosophical questions, Mulvaney, Robert J., 2014]</li>
<li>&quot;Hence the application of mathematics to nature, as regards the sensuous intuition by which nature is given to us, thus becomes possible and definite. Above all, the reader must pay attention to the mode of proof of the principles which occur under the title of “analogies of experience. ” For these do not refer to the genesis of intuitions, as do the principles of applying mathematics to natural science in general, but to the connection of their existence in an experience; and this can be nothing but the determination of their existence in time according to necessary laws, under which alone the connection is objectively valid and thus becomes experience.&quot;[Philosophic Classics: From Plato to Derrida, Forrest E. Baird, 2016]</li>
