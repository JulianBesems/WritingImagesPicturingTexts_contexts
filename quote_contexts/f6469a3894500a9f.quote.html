    <pre>3.3 ELEMENTALS Now that we&#x27;ve established the material we&#x27;ll be using, this chapter will discuss the ways in which the contents are resolved into their subsequent elements. These elements are what will act as the indices by which we will compute the projections and searches within and across the domains. We shall therefore here outline how these elements will act as symbolic representations for their domains, and how this representation is achieved through different ways of encoding the information. TEXT We will first discuss all elements from the text domain that will feature in WIPT. book Even though not all of the documents included in the text domain the 1.1M documents described in 3.2.1 would normally be referred to as books, we will use the term book to refer to any of the highest order documents in the text domain in order to avoid confusion further on with the documents in the multi-modal domains. The book as a full entity is in all instances treated purely as text as such. The processing of this from the original file format was discussed in 3.2.1. The next step is to make this full text &#x27;measurable&#x27; or in other words create a vectorisation for each book. Given the scale and length of each book, the method used for this is TF-IDF with LSA applied afterwards. Before building the TF-IDF matrix the text is pre-processed through first finding all words, getting rid of all punctuation and capitalisation. Then stop-words are removed, words are lemmatised, and finally non-english words are removed, reducing the full book to a normalised list of terms. A short example of the preprocessing transformation applied to the red quote above: &#x27;see&#x27;, &#x27;begun&#x27;, &#x27;see&#x27;, &#x27;instability&#x27;, &#x27;meaning&#x27;, &#x27;uncertainty&#x27;, &#x27;reference&#x27;, &#x27;experiencing&#x27;, &#x27;first&#x27;, &#x27;hand&#x27;, &#x27;generally&#x27;, &#x27;termed&#x27;, &#x27;linguistic&#x27;, &#x27;indeterminacy&#x27;, &#x27;simply&#x27;, &#x27;function&#x27;, &#x27;expression&#x27;, &#x27;interpretation&#x27;, &#x27;well&#x27;, &#x27;arises&#x27;, &#x27;imper

<em>We will then discuss all elements from the image domain that will feature in WIPT, including the 1.2M images described in 3.2.2. The next step is to make these images &#x27;measurable&#x27; or in other words create a vectorisation for each image. Given the scale and complexity of each image, the method used for this is CNN with LSA applied afterwards. Before building the CNN matrix the image is pre-processed through first detecting all objects, getting rid of all noise and distortion. Then edge detection and colour segmentation are applied, followed by object recognition and feature extraction. Finally, the full image is reduced to a normalised list of features. A short example of the preprocessing transformation applied to the blue image above:  ...</em></pre>

<li>&quot;The ‘liquid architecture’ of the brain, he tells a rapt audience, did not evolve to see the world as it is. We see what it has proved useful to see in the past. Vision is like a text with missing letters that the brain makes guesses at, informed by accumulated experience. Studying human perception by asking people what they see is deeply flawed as no one is an independent observer of nature – their perception, and therefore their answers, can only be from within their own ecology of knowledge and learned experience.&quot;[Attlee, James *Nocturne: A Journey in Search of Moonlight*.

<li>&quot;Alberti’s method seems to be of his own invention. 106 The game is to determine the  distance from the viewer’s location to a remote but visible place. The example chosen by  Alberti is the distance to Bologna from a location near Ferrara, a distance of over 20                                                             104 See note 194, p. 57 in the present volume.  105 The introduction of [Alberti 2007] contains some additional commentary, as well; in particular,  see the figures on p. 39, which are also given in [Furlan and Souffrin 2001: 20].  106 See [Souffrin 1998: 90].  &quot;[INPUT: Williams et al. - 2010 - The Mathematical Works of Leon Battista Alberti.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;This skill requires identifying, mapping, and selectively adapting existing mental models to new tasks for which the model was never intended. Such a process remains almost impossible to 346 | APPENDIX automate. Very little exists in this area beyond preliminary research.

<li>&quot;A nele, once trained, is able to distinguish between the real image, purpa, and its external appearance. Pushing the argument presented in the previous chapter a bit further, it could be said that designs on the kurkin of nelekana are invisible to human beings but are visible to cosmic entities. It is therefore a matter of perspective. What human beings see as white, animal entities see as designed and beautiful. And what human beings see as designed and beautiful, animal entities see as white. At the same time the absence of designs on a nele’s kurkin is also perceived as a source of light and refraction by human beings, showing the connections between small nelekana and invisible animal entities.&quot;[Fortis, Paolo *Kuna Art and Shamanism: An Ethnographic Approach*.

<li>&quot;Meno is quite interested in Socrates’ account of Empedoclean effluvia [aporrhoē] as a possible explanation of how human perception works (76c). To our modern ears, this part of the dialogue probably sounds like proto-natural science: when I see a red tomato, something must be “flowing off”, striking my eye. Additionally, these effluvia are like keys that unlock only my eyes, not my ears. (I can’t hear the red of a tomato, I can only see it. Other things, of course, I hear but can’t see: different keys for different locks, then. )&quot;[Holbo, John, and Belle Waring *Reason &amp; Persuasion: Three Dialogues by Plato: Euthyphro, Meno, Republic, Book 1*. 3rd ed.

<li>&quot;He is always moving in a way that cannot be understood. Some people on the outside perceive this as deception, but they deceive themselves!Others see what they imagine they ought to see. They create their own definitions of budo. &quot;You must be an artist to see these things. &quot;Survival of the body—survival of the heart—requires us to avoid any rigid form and to deny inevitability.

<li>&quot;More particularly, his concern is with the relation between the two. Of central importance to his whole later work is the idea that there is a kind of seeing that is also a kind of thinking (or, at least, a kind of understanding): the seeing of connections. We see a connection in the same sense that we see an aspect, or a Gestalt To distinguish this sense of ‘see’ from that in which we see a physical object, and to describe the connections and the differences between this sense of ‘see’ and the concepts of ‘thinking’ and ‘understanding’, is the central task of the work written at Ross’s Hotel.&quot;[Monk, Ray *Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius*.

<li>&quot;In the mother-son couple the capacity to see of one depends on the other’s incapacity to see, or even the other’s death. ²³ There is a connection between the two main characteristics that the Kuna ascribe to kurkin: intelligence and capacity to see. Both features have been described so far as being fairly independent, but what I want to show now is their intrinsic interconnectedness. Intelligence is kurkin, which entails the capacity to see and to grasp the inner image of things. Intelligence is intended by the Kuna as the capacity to learn, to acquire knowledge.&quot;[Fortis, Paolo *Kuna Art and Shamanism: An Ethnographic Approach*. University of Texas Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;What Gödel would have given to see this language, where modifying a statement causes the entire grammar to be adjusted. With this language, I can see how my mind is operating. I don&#x27;t pretend to see my own neurons firing; such claims belong to John Lilly and his LSD experiments of the sixties. What I can do is perceive the gestalts; I see the mental structures forming, interacting. I see myself thinking, and I see the equations that describe my thinking, and I see myself comprehending the equations, and I see how the equations describe their being comprehended.&quot;[Chiang, Ted *Stories of Your Life and Others*.
