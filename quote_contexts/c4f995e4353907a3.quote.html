    <pre>The regions are assembled to stage a scenography alongside the writing; not illustrations of it, but a backdrop and context. In practice, the prose navigates one textual field while, orthogonally, a visual field unfolds. This is our instrumented way of involving multiple domains while maintaining their differences. Serres, reading Leibniz, describes such contrapuntal analysis: *“Generally, the analysis is spun in such a way that several areas are involved at the same time: it is by this contrapuntal style that one recognises the master&#x27;s pen. This makes us understand why the overall system is always the horizon of each analysis: through successive multivalences, we move towards the whole. The unilinearity of the writing itself is thus overcome.”.* The operative image we seek to establish in this context is not a Cartesian chain but a network: *&quot;since the image that Descartes and tradition have left us of their order is that of a chain, which concretises for the imagination the unity of progression and the connection of reasons, the image that imposes itself here is that of a network with several concurrent chains, which presents multiple &quot;entries&quot; and intersections: tapestry, weaving, embroidery or lace&quot;*. This is why our image lists prefer complementarity over sameness: each constellation is composed to hold together scenographically rather than repeat a single motif. Where Batia Suter&#x27;s *Parallel Encyclopedia* traverses pictorial plenty through thematic clusters of depiction mediated by her personal observations, this setup approaches a collective visual reading via navigation by writing. As Suter notes on her method, *&quot;Coincidence is like an instrument that can be played&quot;*, which holds in our digital setup as well, where outcomes remain probabilistic rather than certain.</pre>

      <li>&quot;A representational image is deconstructed here to show the various compositional strategies—beyond the selection of subject and drawing medium—that the designer has considered in creating a well-resolved image. Each aspect of the composition reinforces the others. Mixing Image Styles As with all compositional strategies, creating contrast among visual elements is key to surprising, refreshing, and enlivening layouts—and this is no less true for imagery. Aside from the big-picture contrasts afforded by changing sizes, shapes, color, and spatial arrangement, combining different modes of image offers an important and highly effective method for introducing contrast.&quot;[Samara, Timothy *Design Elements: A Graphic Style Manual*. Rockport Publishers, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;To suggest the hegemony of a specific style of visual experience is not to exclude the other senses, but to perhaps suggest that they are increasingly defined in relationship to the visual and its associate technologies in the contexts discussed here— film image and themescape. The transfer of a visual logic onto the nonvisual reduces other sensuous geographies to visual-like ones and so hides their distinctive contribution to the multisensual nature of geographical experience and understanding.&quot;[Rodaway, Paul *Sensuous Geographies*. 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;(quoted by Mikesell 1968:578) Here, we not only have an eye-first geography, but an eye linked to synthetic thinking and the geographer employing visual tools. The whole statement is written within the framework of visual metaphors—landscape and perspective. This visualism, or tendency to reduce all sensuous experience to visual terms, is evident both in geography as a discipline and in contemporary culture (Eco 1986). It is, however, a relatively modern phenomenon and closer examination suggests that such visualism is not so all pervading as might initially be supposed.&quot;[Rodaway, Paul *Sensuous Geographies*. 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;The gap between the concrete idea and the ambiguously presented image that refers to it can provide more complex avenues of interpretation and a rich, engaging experience that yields deeper, more complex understanding. A jarring grid of checkered spaces gives way to a set of ellipses that change the pattern’s density to create type forms. The change also creates a strange, somewhat translucent quality and an ambiguous optical separation between the title and the background. Leonardo Sonnoli Italy Two conflicting grids—one for text, one for images—encourage bizarre overlaps of type and pictures, as well as linear elements, in this book spread.&quot;[Samara, Timothy *Design Elements: A Graphic Style Manual*. Rockport Publishers, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;The brilliance of Klingemann’s identification of the content of the illustrations lies not in a reliance on a specific method, but on a combination of approaches. He employs multiple data clustering algorithms alongside a manual clustering of image training sets organised using human vision. The most prevalent method for making image content searchable, though, does not so much involve ‘vision’ as text. It is the spectral presence of words that haunt these various techniques, from the ‘Bag of Words’ model, and the textual metadata that underpins the pictures 3 SEARCHABILITY 39 retrieved from Google Images, to the crowdsourced tags in ImageNet that have been used in recent deep-learning experiments. 15 This dependence on words is a key component of large-scale databases containing illustrations that do not rely on computer vision, but instead use the surrounding text to ‘explain’ and return relevant images, whether this is the OCRed text (sometimes including the image caption), bibliographic and other metadata, or an amalgamation of different textual information.&quot;[(auth.), Julia Thomas *Nineteenth-Century Illustration and the Digital: Studies in Word and Image*. Palgrave Macmillan, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Vision is not presented with a picture of a totality to view at leisure, to explore methodically like a work of art, but rather visual experiences flow past us, we catch glimpses of this and that, identify and linger on this or that, and so build up a collection of images and changes in our minds, that is, we compose a view. In remembering experience, we tend to reduce the flow of visual experience to specific images or scenes, that is to moments, to snapshots. In considering examples of ways in which we use sight in geographical experience and visual tools and concepts to present geographical information, such as the map, or to simulate the experience of places, such as film, we continually need to remind ourselves about the dynamic nature of visual experience, that is, of its temporal nature.&quot;[Rodaway, Paul *Sensuous Geographies*. 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;This relation is one that defines illustration, generates its meanings, and determines how it is viewed, yet it has received scant attention from critics. Lorraine Janzen Kooistra, one of the few scholars to examine the interaction between word and image in the context of illustration of the 1890s, remarks that ‘Although most studies of illustrated books pay lip service to the significant interactions of image and text, few critics have gone further to investigate just how these interactions work, or to theorize visual/verbal relationships’. 1 Kooistra proposes a notion of ‘bitextuality’ that accounts for the dialogue between word and image through an engagement with the sexualised discourse in which illustration is described.&quot;[(auth.), Julia Thomas *Nineteenth-Century Illustration and the Digital: Studies in Word and Image*. Palgrave Macmillan, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Overall, this book argues for an intersection between the digital and illustration studies by drawing together these apparently distinct areas. Each chapter suggests how the concerns of the digital map onto the concerns of illustration studies and vice versa: the process of digital remediation and image processing is bound up in the visual identity of illustration (Chap. 2); the mechanisms for making image content searchable are intertwined with the politics of word and image (Chap. 3); and crowdsourced tagging is an activity that generates questions about what an ‘illustration’ is (Chap.&quot;[(auth.), Julia Thomas *Nineteenth-Century Illustration and the Digital: Studies in Word and Image*. Palgrave Macmillan, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The resulting surprise breathes life into the pacing among pages and highlights the content that is off the grid. Visual Logic Structuring the Page Intuitive Arrangement Integrating Type and Image Layout Systems COMPARE THE LOCATION of spatial breaks from left to right across this page spread with the grid diagram; although the majority of typographic and image content responds to the column structure, several items noticeably shift off the structure to introduce visual surprise and focus attention.&quot;[Samara, Timothy *Design Elements: A Graphic Style Manual*. Rockport Publishers, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;This is what Ricoeur calls an abstracted image, that is, an icon. In interpreting this specific line, the image can be visualized, and even &#x27;mapped&#x27; in a more or less literal sense, namely by visualizing a bare tree with black birds instead of fruits, or vice versa. 310 Thus, in reading this particular line, one may rely on the description of a concrete image that provides the basis for constructing an interpretation. We dwell on the image of black birds and fruit, and form an &#x27;icon&#x27; that captures the metaphorical predication in an almost visual representation.&quot;[Brouwer, Elisabeth Cathérine *Imagining Metaphors: Cognitive Representation in Interpretation and Understanding*. Institute for Logic, Language and Computation Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;The geometric relation between the concurrent motions of just two forms as in Figure Seeing 455 2C is not generally sufficient to specify the perspective transformation that has yielded the observed spatio-temporal image. By the fundamental theorem of plane perspectivity (Delone, 1963), the perspective mapping of four points in general position (where no three points are collinear) in one image plane onto a corresponding set of four points in another image plane is necessary and sufficient to ensure that all of the remaining points are in isometric correspondence in the two planes.&quot;[Kaiser, Mary K., Arthur C. Grunwald, and Stephen R. Ellis *Pictorial communication in virtual and real environments*. London: New York, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991.]</li>
<li>&quot;In the 16 Interactive Mathematical Visualizations 359 temporally-stacked model, transitional changes are unveiled in one location, where sequential visual images are stacked on top of one another, a new image replacing the previous one in time. Movies are prime examples of this model of narrating visual change. In the distributed model, communication of the transitional changes to the visualization is not limited to one location only, but it spans within a region in space.&quot;[Zudilova-Seinstra, Elena, Tony Adriaansen, Robert van Liere (auth.), Robert Liere, Tony Adriaansen, and Elena Zudilova-Seinstra (eds.) *Trends in Interactive Visualization: State-of-the-Art Survey*. Springer-Verlag London, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;With this approach it is easy for the user to point at interesting structures in the image domain, and to assign visual attributes in the parameter domain. The effect of changing visual parameters is immediately visible in the 3D image Fig. 5. 8. The concept of interacting in different domains is not completely new. In the field of information visualization such an interaction is called brushing. Brushing represents an intuitive way for the user to visually select subsets of the data samples without the necessity to specify numerical ranges.&quot;[Zudilova-Seinstra, Elena, Tony Adriaansen, Robert van Liere (auth.), Robert Liere, Tony Adriaansen, and Elena Zudilova-Seinstra (eds.) *Trends in Interactive Visualization: State-of-the-Art Survey*. Springer-Verlag London, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;It must, therefore, according to Ernst Cassirer, be the aim to set thought free from immediate experience and to find instead a structure of thought that is based on the invariants of experience. 12 Because such a structure of thought is concerned with functional relations, number has to take the place of vision. While vision, or its representation in the form of the picture, portrays particular spatial compositions, reflecting immediate experience, our thought must concern itself instead with conceptual mathematical space.&quot;[Von Maltzahn, Kraft E. *Nature As Landscape: Dwelling and Understanding*. Mcgill Queens University Press, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;Even when a visual reference is fairly direct, unnecessary embellishment of the image (c) can distract if it evokes additional, undesired associations. The Label icon above, for example, seems more like a price tag, or ticket, while the Scrolled Text icon, thanks to its dog-eared paper element, misleadingly suggests a file- or document-level operation 196 Image and Representation n n FAULTS (a) SCREEN ^ V r ^ w1 (b) (g&gt; (d) &lt;e) (f) ww—i ^ fr (c) 217: Culture or language dependencies. The pragmatic aspect of an image describes assumptions about the viewer and the viewing environment that are implicit in any visual representation.&quot;[Mullet, Kevin, and Darrell Sano *Designing Visual Interfaces: Communication Oriented Techniques*.
