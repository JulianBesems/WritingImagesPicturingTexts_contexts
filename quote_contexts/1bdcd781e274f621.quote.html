    <pre>Make a sentence about stairs with: feeling beginning someone reality half private woman love certainly hate.

<em>Stairs led her to a private reality where she could be herself, free from the feeling of being watched by someone who didn&#x27;t love her, and certainly not hate her. As she climbed, the sounds of the world outside grew fainter, and she felt a sense of liberation wash over her.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;This type of construction takes a bit more expertise and time, but it pays big rewards in a graceful appearance far beyond what you would expect on such a modest deck. In fact, the scalloped edge is what brings this deck to life, and the stairs are a big part of that flair. The best deck stairs integrate with the design so that the eye doesn’t even necessarily read the steps as steps.&quot;[Peterson, Chris *Deck ideas you can use: creative deck designs for every home &amp; yard*.

<li>&quot;Also, counterflow was present in the stair with only the photoluminescent markings. Density was calculated for the average conditions in each stair during the busiest 3 min of the drill. The densities were 2. 05 persons/m2 (photoluminescent markings stair), 1. 00 persons/m2 (reduced emergency lighting and photoluminescent markings stair), 1. 23 persons/m2 (reduced emergency lighting stair), and 1. 30 persons/m2 (normal emergency lighting stair).&quot;[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A.

<li>&quot;While the philosophy of “storing” stationary occupants in stairs is not intended, the stairs remain a more protected space within the building. Some occupants may choose to use stairs (particularly on the lower floors) and the ability to find refuge in stairs is an important redundancy. Where occupant egress elevators are provided it is expected that most occupants will use them, but some minimum capacity for refuge is needed.&quot;[Bukowski, Richard W. *Emergency Egress From Buildings*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;The flows through stairs are imposed by the user in relation to the admitted flows through the stairs, i. e. imposing the capacity of the stairs and the speeds of the occupants. Also in this case, the default setting employed by the model for stairs is the one provided by NFPA 130, i. e. , the values for a ramp slope &gt; or &lt; 4 % up and down. Model users can also modify this default setting with the desired flow through stairs.&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Results show that the use of two stairs (Strategy 1) for high-rise building evacuations provide higher evacuation times compared with any other strategy employed. Results about the evacuation time using three stairs or a combination of elevators and stairs present lower results than the use of two stairs. The use of three stairs or a combined use of stairs and elevators presents evacuation times in approximately the same range.&quot;[Ronchi, Enrico, and Daniel Nilsson (auth.) *Assessment of Total Evacuation Systems for Tall Buildings*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;34, para. 6, sent. 2 of the MBO specifies that stairs must be fitted with handrails on both sides and intermediate handrails where this is necessary for safety reasons. However, some federal state building regulations stipulate this for stairs in buildings with more than two dwellings reached via stairs. If stepless access (i. e. ramp or lift) to these dwellings is not possible, the use of the stairs by older occupants should be made safer and more comfortable by providing a handrail on both sides.&quot;[Heiss, Oliver *Barrier-Free Design*. Birkhäuser Architecture, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Stairs Semicircular stairs nestled between walls of foundation skirting is an excellent feature for distinguishing a fairly undistinguished deck. This small, gray dining deck also features natural wood railings with glass inserts, but it’s the stairs that set a truly sophisticated tone. This is why choosing stair style is always a part of a good deck design—they should never be an afterthought Stair configuration goes far in determining how the deck is perceived.&quot;[Peterson, Chris *Deck ideas you can use: creative deck designs for every home &amp; yard*.

<li>&quot;Our body’s matter mounts upon the stairs’ matter. We are both worn. We rise by some internal persistence that corresponds to the intemality of the function that keeps the stairs in perpetual tension. The stairs are ready for us. Their readiness draws us to them. We are ready for the stairs. Our readiness opens them to our participation. Since we have the potentiality of climbing stairs, and an intention to do so, the stairs give The Ruin as l unction PI.&quot;[Ginsberg, Robert *The Aesthetics of Ruins: Illustrated by the Author*.
