From a simple separation of space to a complex system of partitioning, the wall adapts to the changing needs of its occupants. The relationship between the wall and the activity it encloses becomes increasingly intimate, reflecting the growing complexity of human society. The wall, once a mere divider, now plays a pivotal role in shaping the very fabric of our existence.", "suggest_context": "4.1.2 WALL How the lapse of time affects ownership and usage of the wall. Hanging loosely, perhaps flapping, the woven screen generates- and, crucially, symbolizes - the division and organization of activities within the primitive dwelling. The woven \"wall\" is an enabler of civilization; the thick structural wall merely a defender of it.The hanging wall has an apparent descent compared to the foot wall. He argued that structure is there within the wall, but the importance of the wall is the visible spatial enclosure. As thin as possible: fantasy of the two-dimensional wall, sketched in 3D by SANAA for the Kunstlinie Almere, Netherlands. The meaning of the wall is just as diverse as the uses of vertical surface can be, but there are at least two essential functions: providing structure and dividing space. Practically, however, the two modes of action are always in some sort united.
