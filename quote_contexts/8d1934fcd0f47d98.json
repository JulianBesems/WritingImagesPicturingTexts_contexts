Kohonens own description tells us why this suits our use: The SOM model may not be a replica of any input item but only a local average over a subset of items that are most similar to it, which makes it a compact, query-time-light substrate for projecting and re-projecting. In this sense the screen functions as a generic machine for alphabets: it lets domains speak in their own terms, and then enables us to read them architectonically via casts.\n\n*The SOM's genericness allows it to bridge the gap between the public and private screens, as it can project and re-project the biases and observations across the different surfaces. This enables the constitution of a common ground, a shared dimensionality, for the different modalities to interact and communicate.
