The model is then fine-tuned through a process of iterative refinement, where the output is evaluated and adjusted based on the desired level of correlation between the modalities. This process is repeated until the model is able to produce output that accurately reflects the desired correlation, which is then used to generate the final draft of the thesis.", "suggest_context": "3.1 OUTLINE - The text editor operates in a multi-modal manner, constantly both personal and general. - There are different layers of private and public: the private construct of choices and curation facilitates the projection on the common sense - The Scales of the data differs. Therefore the role of the model is here interpreted as the curation and construction of the correlation between the modalities that are facilitated by a chosen set of multi-modal documents. The primary dataset for this is a selection of 215 films which are used as the primary model used to write this thesis. This chapter will describe how this model is constructed and how other modes can be used to establish other biases, which will be demonstrated in the writing of chapter 4."}
