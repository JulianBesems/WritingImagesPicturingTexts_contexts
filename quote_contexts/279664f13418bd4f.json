The integers mathbbZ, taken with addition, form a group: the identity element 0 and additive inverses belong to the structure, and addition acts as translation: linear displacement along a domain. Likewise, the non-zero rationals mathbbQ, taken with multiplication, form a group: multiplication composes scalings and provides multiplicative inverses. The point is not the examples themselves, but that a mathematical object is never only what is it; it is also what can be done. This becomes especially visible in the relation between the real plane and the complex numbers. The set of complex numbers mathbbC can be visualised as a two-dimensional plane mathbbR2, mapping the real and imaginary components as coordinates. Under an object-geometry optic, this identification appears to settle the matter: complex numbers are just points in a plane. Yet once complex multiplication is taken as the relevant operation, the coordinate picture no longer shows what matters. Addition remains translation, but multiplication acts as a change of frame: scaling and rotation; inversion generates singularities; phase and magnitude become structural. In that sense, what aligns geometrically becomes insufficient operationally. A phase plot does not depict content but the behaviour of an operation: how a function displaces domains and codomains through its own internal structure.

It signals a condition relevant to architecture: when domains of architectural communication are treated merely as sets of information to be aligned or translated, their operative capacity is lost. Treating them operationally means understanding how each mode reshapes the interpretive field of another; how a section reconfigures a plan, how a perspective drawing projects a spatial logic without resolving it. Machine learning models, especially cross-modal ones like CLIP, tend to treat modalities as data to be aligned in a shared space. But what this produces is rarely a reversible correspondence. Although the training pairs are presented as one-to-one, the learned relation is better understood as a field of probabilistic association: a single image can plausibly support many captions, and a caption can plausibly support many images. Retrieval itself introduces an operator nearest neighbours, top-k ranking, thresholding, but it does not yield an inverse in the mathematical sense; it stages a contingent passage. This irreversibility is not a flaw; it is a sign that we are dealing with something more complex than a set of equivalents. Architectural modalities function similarly: they are not mirrors, but projections. They require a framework that accounts for how representations interact, not how they match.
