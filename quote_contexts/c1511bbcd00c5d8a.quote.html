      <li>&quot;For one thing, no 2D entity can be a physical, material object. Therefore, it may be said, a succession of 2D movie or TV images can be at best a poor surrogate of motion.

<li>&quot;The database becomes the centre of the creative process in the computer age. Historically, the artist made a unique work within a particular medium. In this sense, the interface and the work were the same, ie the level of an interface did not exist. With new media, the content of the work and the interface become separate. It is therefore possible to create different interfaces to the same material. These interfaces may present different versions of the same work, as in David Blair’s WaxWeb. 12 Or they may be radically different from each other, as in Moscow WWWArt Centre. 13 This is one of the ways in which the already discussed principle of variability of new media manifests itself. But now we can give this principle a new formulation. The new media object consists of one or more interfaces to a database of multimedia material. If only one interface is constructed, the result will be similar to a traditional art object; but this is an exception rather than the norm. &quot;[INPUT: Manovich - Database as Symbolic Form.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;In future publications I hope to elaborate more on these topics. This book aims to present the main argument for the necessity of a new framework, and to outline it in an economical way. It is an attempt to present the general idea. This book provides visual models as an approach to synthesizing theories. I use these figures to represent my ideas, despite criticisms from colleagues in the humanities and social sciences, who often remind me that they reduce the complexity of the subject area. I use them partly 14 Cybersemiotics because of my background in the sciences (in which models are a language), and partly based on my belief in Herman Hesse’s ideas in Magister Ludi 1 and Brockmann’s idea (1995) of a ‘third culture’ between art and science, in which scientists serve as productive philosophers and designers of knowledge.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd.

<li>&quot;The eleven chapters that compose this study mark a broad  territory of concerns, ranging from drawing to code, communication to curation, constructed vision to optical illusion. What they  share is a curiosity about the myriad ways in which mathematics— including particularly mathematical notions of modeling and  drawing—was spliced into the creative practice of design. Chapter  2 considers an original mechanical encapsulation of mathematical knowledge, the encoding of curve construction in complex  drawing machines.&quot;[INPUT: AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Nongraphic symbolic encodings  in mathematical functions seemed ascendant, as new realities  required new representations equal to those realities. If new dimensions shook confidence in old systems of  both drawing and measurement, in some ways architecture was  a salutatory discipline to the possibility of higher-dimensional  representation. Architecture was subject to a range of invisible  forces of dynamic operation and evaluation that were not well  represented by drawings alone.&quot;[INPUT: AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Or again, though the details of this would be technically complicated, we could envisage a case in which the external item corresponding to physical space was a twodimensional sense-field organized as if it were three-dimensional. Nor are we restricted to examples in which the discrepancy between how things really are and how they empirically seem relates to 299 Succinct Case for Idealism ~ 0\ -. ·u G Time 1 Time 2 Time 3 Time 4 ~ 0\ U-+· Gc) G TimeS Time 6 Fig. 13. 1.

<li>&quot;On the other hand, the embodied metaphoric claim is an extension of a current approach, one which is not without controversy. While I will not review the pros and cons, nor “claim sides,” I do hope to convince the reader that use of a metaphoric analysis of the tacit, taken-for-granted, aspects of mathematical physics can illuminate the representational power of mathematics. 1 Finally, I use recent research on expertise and long term working memory as an explanatory tool, a way of justifying the metaphoric analysis and of suggesting ways in which model based reasoning can be learned and acquired as a working tool. Model-Based Reasoning. Model-based reasoning rests on the claim that scientific thinking is largely a matter of the development of mental models of a richly varied sort; models that are involved in constructive and manipulative activities and that draw upon information in various formats, including linguistic and imagistic simulations, as well as external representations [39].&quot;[Magnani, Lorenzo *Model-based reasoning in science and technology : theoretical and cognitive issues*. Springer, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;The interesting points then become the periods where one episode stops and another one starts. This would namely imply a shift of model in a model-based reasoning perspective. Following our earlier arguments, these moments might thus be considered as the points where abductive leaps of interpretation are made, resulting in new ideas, new models, new understandings. 2. 4 The Place of Analogy Of course, a leap of interpretation is never randomly made. Also in the linkograph representation, links are available that span two or more episodes (cross-episode links).&quot;[Magnani, Lorenzo *Model-based reasoning in science and technology : theoretical and cognitive issues*. Springer, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;What we encounter here is an example of the general principle of new media: the projection of the ontology of a computer onto culture itself. If in  physics the world is made of atoms and in genetics it is made of 84 genes, computer programming encapsulates the world according to its own logic. The world is reduced to two kinds of software objects That are considered complementary to each other: data structures and algorithms. Any process or task is reduced to an algorithm, a final sequence of simple operations that a computer can execute to accomplish a given task. And any object in the world - be it the population of a city, or the weather over the course of a century, a chair, a human brain - is modelled as a data structure, ie data organised in a particular way for efficient search and retrieval (such as arrays, linked lists and graphs &quot;[INPUT: Manovich - Database as Symbolic Form.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The reifying fiction of “Time as Such” is further entrenched in linguistic structure, in “Passage” constructions, and idiomatic usage, in which “time is money”, “time is scarce”, people are time-poor, and time endlessly presses up against us. The symbolic cognitive artifacts of clock and calendar have changed our minds along with the niches our minds inhabit, and there is no going back in time. And yet, a moment’s reflection will tell us that the event-based habitus of the Amondawa, however strange it seems to us when we first encounter it, is the one that has formed the matrix of temporal experience for most human societies.&quot;[Magnani, Lorenzo *Model-based reasoning in science and technology : theoretical and cognitive issues*. Springer, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Particularly for  architecture, machines like sophisticated drawing instruments— and, by extension, digital drawing devices—play unique roles as  transdisciplinary interfaces to mathematics itself. As new machines like ellipsographs, conchoidographs, and  planimeters began to encode the knowledge required to perform  certain architectural drawing procedures, an epistemological distinction between design knowledge and instrumental knowledge  emerged. On the one hand, we might define design knowledge as  the architect’s trained intuition of formal organization principles  such as the relationship of parts to a whole, the ranges of material effects, and the appropriate use of geometry. 6 Instrumental  knowledge is the narrower understanding of the procedures to  successfully manipulate a certain type of technique or technology, which would include the ability to operate an instrument, a  device, a machine, a process, or a software to intended effect. 7 In  addition to its expedient use to accomplish a particular design,  instrumental knowledge facilitates the creation of systems of  interrelated technologies to systematically realize design agendas.&quot;[INPUT: AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Now, continuity of motions is a feature of action by contact, on which the localizability of causal interactions is grounded, but it is also a feature of time. As mentioned above, one of the reasons why the dynamical approach presents itself as essentially different from, and more adequate than, connectionism is that it makes reference to continuous time, whereas networks and their learning algorithms are indexed by discrete time, which is not the time of natural phenomena, if not by the mere fact that the “clock” pace varies for different systems.&quot;[(Editor), Alberto Peruzzi *Mind and Causality*.

<li>&quot;This is so. Nevertheless, can be interpreted in such a way as to restore the integrity of the translation scheme. may be understood as a 3D object which exists only at time t and no other time. It is not an enduring 3D The 3D/4D Controversy 135 object. It is an instantaneous one, a collection of particles in a spatial configuration which constitutes object O at time t. The upshot of this is that the intertranslatability of 3D and 4D descriptions rests ultimately upon entities which can be described indifferently as “instantaneous 4D temporal parts”, or “3D objects which exist at one time only”.&quot;[McCall, Storrs *The Consistency of Arithmetic: And Other Essays*.

<li>&quot;This organizational structure includes retrieval systems and user interfaces. These feedback analyses allow us to see information-storing and intermediary systems as self-organizing cybernetic systems in a constant inner interaction, one that includes users as causal parts of the system. Von Foerster (1992a, 310) formulates this basic insight of cybernetics as follows: ‘Should one name one central concept, a first principle of cybernetics, it would be circularity – circularity as it appears in the circular flow of signals in organizationally closed systems; or in circular causality, that is, in processes in which ultimately a state reproduces itself. ’ Transferred to document-mediating systems, this means that these systems develop in a constant inner exchange between the producers,’ indexers,’ and users’ intellectual horizons. 16 This understanding is inspired by systems science and especially by the new second-order cybernetics (von Foerster 1979, 1981, 1992a), which works intentionally with the integration of the observer’s observation process into the actual system description.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd.
