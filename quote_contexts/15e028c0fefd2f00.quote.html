    <pre>In an attempt to add flexibility to this static 3D model, parametric/generative design has provided means to define a multitude of outputs based on a coded base system. However as Ishigami puts it, this computerisation does not merit a distinguishment of the base and the output, they should be working simultaneously. The architect should still be equally invested in the output, and not merely the creation of systems through mathematical formulations. Parametric design, through its system based control over the output, “reduces to numbers, the infinites and self-reflections”.</pre>

      <li>&quot;*Thus, the abandoned and temporarily forgotten model of the private house came up to the office and re-entered the cycles of design. Lingering on the tables of models for months, it was finally taken with new assumptions, reshaped, refreshed and adjusted* — **The proportionality of association which is birthed from a navigation through abundance. Rotations between nature, an object of communication that exists for itself, has quality. A 3D model, being a file on a computer, that has to be rotated to become spatial (ludger lecture) does not have this potential.** [Villa Riccardo Matteo - 2019 - Architecture as Currency.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D8HVT82H?page=66&amp;annotation=WECBB58S)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Mined from advanced mathematics, the complexities and contradictions of this architecture multiply, leading to the story’s surreal conclusion (to which we shall return). Fantastic as it may seem, this fiction was paralleled to a remarkable degree by ever-deeper architectural fascination with modern mathematics in mid-twentieth-century design culture. In fact, exactly the methods that Quintus Teal mentions—such as modular structures and homomorphology—were taken up by architects who saw in advanced mathematics a portal to dizzying new spaces and practices, unerringly precise and resolutely contemporary. This book probes the facts of form and the frontiers of creative rationality. It confronts these conjoined issues through a close reading of mathematics as it was drawn, encoded, imagined, and interpreted by architects in the mid-twentieth century, on the eve of digitization. The Swiss architect, artist, and educator Max Bill neatly distilled the general mathematical optimism in his 1949 essay “The Mathematical Approach in Contemporary Art” (Die mathematische Denkweise in der Kunst unserer Zeit) when he announced, “I am convinced it is possible to evolve a new form of art in which the artist’s work could be founded to quite a substantial degree on a mathematical line of approach to its content. ”2* — **Good point, however now the realm of mathematics we talk about here is one of form finding applications, thus leading to combinatoric complexity. The mathematics in itself is not one of complexity, nor one of euclidean geometry. In this fashion we should not seek to find a mathematical model that relies on functions producing architecture. Instead seeking for associations between the domains of architectural communication and understanding is one that mathematical thought is suited at to be able to make talks between domains. Putting them in proportion instead of geometry. In a fitting way the current emergence of ML models that do not rest on mathematical functions for their projections facilitate a talk that is not of complexity or combinatorics. However the mathematical thought now comes in to be able to speak about the nature of these projections on a level of group theory, topology and category theory. In these mathematical fields the study does not revolve around calculations of singular outcomes, inevitably leading to complexity, instead it is about communications between sets through operations, lifting them out of their singular interchangeable state of objects, but to friends, families and enemies.** [AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RFAYGAN3?page=11&amp;annotation=JYWPTG8F)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*This overview provides enough information to let us investigate the extent to which computer graphics and its modelling schemata have influenced architectural modelling. In this regard, the crucial notion to consider is the notion of space. It was demonstrated that the internal representation of the modelling schemata used in computer-aided design relies not only on Cartesian361 but also topological notions of spatiality. 362 However, the way this internal representation is employed in the modelling process is surprisingly limited.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=75&amp;annotation=9Z9WXXCU)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*But in that case is it still an object? If the object is an invariable structure, it is not one in spite of the changes of perspective, but in that change or through it.* — **Could be relevant for thinking of the architectonic definition as such** [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=128&amp;annotation=RX5SXFUJ)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*virtualizing a sort of phenomenological field in which everything they would consider as architecture could be accommodated.* [Villa Riccardo Matteo - 2019 - Architecture as Currency.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D8HVT82H?page=67&amp;annotation=P7XPS5NB)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*far not as easy and accessible. Consequently we increasingly risk churning out more and more meaningless entropic smooth lines, dross that smothers our heritages and intellectual negotiations under the instant fascinations of surprising geometrical phenomena. If we don’t care.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt &amp; Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=36&amp;annotation=DPLY5ILE)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*planes organized to reflect a pyramid which is not there. And this now is how we would introduce the concept of media: an agent of the stabilities of the world left behind, as a new BoT is being acquired. As exemplified by the Euclidean geometry media-izing the mythical stabilities of the Egyptian pyramids.* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt &amp; Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=27&amp;annotation=ILH7L7FF)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*architectural competitions and the real estate market are the spaces of speculation par excellence* — **Architectural design is inherently a speculative nature, the linear (both in addition of specificity) and cartesian relation of the 3D cad model seek to mitigate this nature, possibly to the detriment of the quality.

Japanese communication of design remains much more on a non specified plane, leading to architectural outcome that dare to take space within a contingency of speculation between the communication model and the manifestation.** [Villa Riccardo Matteo - 2019 - Architecture as Currency.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D8HVT82H?page=64&amp;annotation=CTV99R82)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The second possibility flows directly from this. If one way of altering the definition of architecture is to insist on the architect&#x27;s direct involvement, either calling the drawing &#x27;art&#x27; or pushing it aside in favour of unmediated construction, the other would be to use the transmissive, commutative properties of the drawing to better effect. This latter option - which I call the unpopular option - I wish to discuss in this article.* [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=6&amp;annotation=A5ILQVRK)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The two options, one emphasizing the corporeal properties of things made, the other concentrating on the disembodied properties in the drawing, are diametrically opposed: in the one corner, involvement, substantiality, tangibility, presence, immediacy, direct action; in the other, disengagement, obliqueness, abstraction, mediation and action at a distance.* — **Interesting as an argument for the approach that has been taken to the role of the computational in representing architecture. This has been primarily been through that of the first &quot;popular&#x27; option. Thus the challenges of the second have been neglected in this form/technics of communication.** [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=6&amp;annotation=Q6KQN5ZC)&quot;</li>
