    <pre>. . the floor. Thats right. The floor. Its typically the largest horizontal surface in the room and undeniably the most used. To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor.

<em>The floor is often referred to as the base or foundation of a building, and its material and construction can greatly affect the overall aesthetic and functionality of the space. Depending on the intended use of the room, the floor may be covered with a variety of materials, such as carpet, tile, or wood, to provide comfort, durability, and ease of maintenance.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;2. 1. Structure To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. In primitive buildings, the ground may be used as the floor. In better buildings, the floor may be a deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist indicated in Fig.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*. Springer US, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;Floor-Ceiling Systems Often, for aesthetic reasons, for foot comfort, for noise control or to protect the deck from wear, afloor covering is placed atop the deck. In such cases, the deck is called a subfloor. When a floor is not placed directly on the ground; for example, when a floor extends above a room below, some means must be provided for supporting the deck in place.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;Exceptions to this would be rooms below ground level where damp could damage the timber, rooms which were likely to be wet due to their function, eg kitchens and sculleries, and some working class terraced housing built with clay block floors or stone flags. NB For more information on timber see Chapter 11- Timber-Frame Housing. The floor (often referred to as a raised timber floor or suspended floor) consists of a series of joists supported by the loadbearing walls and covered with floorboards.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;A building’s basic structural materials—wood, masonry, steel, or concrete—determine the ease with which wall and floor openings can be made, creating a major influence on the usefulness of a building for its intended new function. The length of a building’s structural spans (bay size), often related to the building’s age (generally, the more recent buildings have longer spans), will determine the degree of flexibility and openness that can be created; obviously, small bays will restrict partition and furniture placement and limit traffic flow.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;Those who are unfamiliar with these complexities should review the code details related to occupancy loads and means of egress. Materials for Construction The materials available for stair treads are extremely varied. Each of the basic materials itemized next is potentially appropriate for tread surfaces, depending on the stair’s setting. • Wood—including composite wood products and bamboo; the wood may be integral to the construction of the stair or applied to a substrate material.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;Floor Finish A concrete floor can be finished with a sand and cement screed. By adding a floating floor it can provide good resistance to impact sound (from footsteps etc). This usually involves separating the floor finish from the structure by a thin layer of resilient material, ie a material that will return to its original size after being compressed.&quot;[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;BS PD 6440 Accuracy in building. It is important to consider the ceiling in relation to any partitioning system that may be used in the building. In some cases the use of a raised floor system can also have an influence on the type of suspended ceiling, particularly when the building incorporates a large number of mechanical services (see Fig. 4. 1). 3. 3. 1 Appearance Suspended ceilings are often used for the sole purpose of improving the appearance of the underside of the floor or roof above.&quot;[Blanc, Alan *Internal Components*.

<li>&quot;For example, a marble runner within a wooden floor could form a ‘pathway’ through a hall and into a living space, perhaps continuing to the fireplace or window; or in a kitchen, dark wood set into a poured-resin floor could be echoed by a worktop or cabinets of the same wood. One of the joys of introducing contrasting runners is that it allows you to use luxury materials that in large quantities would blow the budget.&quot;[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*.

<li>&quot;The constructional technique for flooring to non-serviced areas comprises decking units or joists and blockwork sleeper walls to save the cost of pedestals and trays. Far more important are the related floor levels for lobbies, stairs and communal service areas such as lavatories, kitchens and door thresholds. Shallow and deep raised floor systems are used to provide different degrees of accessibility.&quot;[Blanc, Alan *Internal Components*. Routledge, 1994.]</li>

<li>&quot;5). The building has a usable floor area (measured to the inside of the walls) of roughly 84. 5 m2 (910 ft2) and an interior volume of approximately 217 m3 (7,660 ft3). The above-grade wall assemblies are a hybrid construction of Compressed Earth Blocks (CEBs) and straw-bales.

<li>&quot;A suggested method is to place a layer of building or tarred paper over the floor panels and cover with any standard flooring material. This may be done during or after construction of the hut. 43 PROTECTION AGAINST BOMBING Protection from bomb blasts and splinters may be provided by banking earth over part of the shelter. The covering should be carried to a height of 3&#x27;–6&quot; above the floor level and sloped back at about 15 degrees (1 to 4 slope) angle to ground level.&quot;[Amidon, Jane, and Jane Amidon *Michael Van Valkenburgh/Allegheny Riverfront Park: Source Books in Landscape Architecture*.

<li>&quot;Figure 4 shows that the expressions contained in the seismic provisions of the UBC 1997 and ASCE/SEI 7-10 to determine floor accelerations for the design of nonstructural components are representative of the floor acceleration envelope.
