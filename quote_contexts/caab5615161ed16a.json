{"created_at": 1765570661.865817, "confirmed": true, "origin": "searched", "search_input": "", "suggested_query": "The tension between computational analysis and architectural intuition has been a subject of debate for decades, with some architects embracing the precision and efficiency of computational design, while others lamenting the loss of the human touch and the limitations of the digital medium. The question remains, however, how can architecture reconcile its speculative and discursive scope with the demands of computational discourse? Can architecture find a way to harness the power of computation while still retaining its capacity for imagination, creativity, and affective resonance? In this context, the notion of \"soft\" metrics and the emphasis on process-based, atmospheric measurement take on a new significance, as they suggest that architecture's value lies not in its quantifiable aspects alone, but in its ability to create spaces that are richly textured, complex, and open to multiple interpretations. By embracing these \"soft\" metrics, architecture can reclaim its ability to think and feel through space, and to create buildings and projects that are attuned to the complexities and ambiguities of human experience.", "suggest_context": "From its origins, architecture has demanded a synthetic intelligence; one that navigates and negotiates between modes of thinking, drawing, modelling, scripting, narrating. As we have seen in the work of Vitruvius, Alberti, Tschumi, Ando, Koolhaas and Ishigami, architecture arises through the tensions and resonances between different kinds of concerns, interests and domains of content. Studio practice relies on a navigation through abundance: models, drawings, texts and references linger, are re-seen and re-read over time. This multimodal capacity sustains architectures discursive and speculative scope. In the contemporary digital condition, this abundance is amplified by the global network Jorge Orozco Esquivel describes: information circulates ad infinitum and objects are characterized from many indexes rather than by single definitions. What are the consequences when the qualitative, the speculative, and the non-geometric dimensions of architecture lose their footing in computational discourse? If computational architecture concludes with functional analysis and optimisation, it risks severing its connection to this open-ended, playful dimension. As Brian Eno states in his book What Art Does, The art engagement begins where the functional engagement ends. His framing is not a definition of art, but an inquiry into what art does; how it operates, resonates, and affects. This operational perspective parallels Timothy Gowerss observation that a mathematical object is what it does. These positions suggest that both art and mathematics fields architecture has always negotiated closely are constituted by actions and effects, not static definitions. Applied to architecture, this implies that its capacity to think and feel through space resides less in formal analysis alone than in the way its media operate across modalities, often through affect, ambiguity, and non-linear intuition. Eno further writes, Feelings are known as fuzzy, hard to pin down, impossible to measure... In a technical culture like Western culture things you can't count, don't count. And we recall the complementary condition Orozco describes on the web, cited in 1.1.1, in which the measure sits outside of correctness, beauty or linguistic understanding, but is rooted in symbolic probability. Both point to a domain of operations that are neither simply subjective nor simply logical, but nevertheless structure how things matter. In such a context that privileges what can be counted, architecture should remain attuned to what resists straightforward quantification, and to the \"soft\", process-based, atmospheric meters by which buildings and projects actually start to count. Michel Serres, writing about Leibniz, notes that \"The image is, here, richer than it was in Pascal: to optical and mechanical values are added infinitesimal, analytical, perspective, logical, physical and metaphysical meanings.\" The challenge of digital architecture can be read in similar terms: the 3D model reliably encodes the optical and mechanical values of a project; architecture, however, operates with additional analytical, logical, physical and even metaphysical layers that are not reducible to this encoding. Architectural computation therefore must create space for what does not count in the numerical sense, but which counts precisely because it resists reduction, because it is enacted through language-games, atmospheres, references and uses."}
