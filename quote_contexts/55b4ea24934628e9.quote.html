      <li>&quot;To begin with, there is no reason to suppose that the several sense-spaces of which a sentient creature may become conscious, each fined with its own peculiar content, should tend, simply because they are many, to enter into any definite spatial intercourse with each other, or lie in any particular order of positions. Even in ourselves we can recognize this. Different feelings may coexist in us without assuming any particular spatial order. The sound of the brook near which I write, the odor of the cedars, the comfort with which my breakfast has fined me, and my interest in this paragraph, all lie distinct in my consciousness, but in no sense outside or alongside of each other.&quot;[James, William *Principles of Psychology*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;1. Particles connect Parts, or whole Sentences together. Besides words which are names of ideas in the mind, there are a great many others that are made use of to signify the CONNEXION that the mind gives to ideas, or to propositions, one with another. The mind, in communicating its thoughts to others, does not only need signs of the ideas it has then before it, but others also, to show or intimate some particular action of its own, at that time, relating to those ideas. This it does several ways; as IS and IS NOT, are the general marks, of the mind, affirming or denying.&quot;[Locke, John *Complete Works of John Locke*. Delphi Classics, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;While enough has probably been expressed in words, a diagram, which is itself a type of linguistic expression, will not hurt (see Figure 5. 4). In this figure, the infrastratum is complex, and thus the infrastratum can be analyzed into substrata both with respect to the intentive process components and to their objects. The perceiving of the vehicle and the thinking of the signification together make up the infrastratum of linguistic experiencing as a whole; it is on the basis of this intentiveness to expressions, to texts and/or speeches, that we experience what the expressions “refer to” or “signify. ” “To signify” is a species of “to represent. ” (Recall that the other species are “to depict” and “to indicate. ”) As with the other two species of indirect experiencing, the object linguistically represented can be anything, including impossible things—e. g. , spherical cubes, which are what the expression, “spherical cubes,” signifies.&quot;[Embree, Lester *Reflective Analysis: A First Introduction into Phenomenological Investigation*. 2nd. Bucharest: Zeta Books, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Which regions of spacewould enter this relation?What makes them different from other regions?Perhaps we can expresseverything we say in a substantive-hole language by paraphrasing our sentencesinto an adjective-hole language or in a purely relational idiom , plus mereology. Perhaps, in order to solve problems of the many-property sort, it sufficesto predicate hole-patterns of parts of objects, and to trace back spatial relations among holes in one and the same object to relations among the object&#x27; s parts.&quot;[Casati, Roberto, and Achille C. Varzi *Holes and Other Superficialities (Bradford Books)*. 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;M y aunt notified me o f her illness about two days before I was to speak at a nearby college. It was the first speaking engagement I ’d accepted in ages. I ’d also accepted a 110 Adventures second one, set for the week after the first, Both had been set up months in advance. T he first engagement gave me my largest face-to-face audience to date. I ’d been asked to speak by the head o f the philosophy department. Five hundred college students crowded together in a garishly lit arena. I ’d made it clear, as always, that I would lecture or answer questions but not have a Seth session.&quot;[Roberts, Jane *Adventures in Consciousness: An Introduction to Aspect Psychology*. Paperback. Prentice Hall, 1978.]</li>
<li>&quot;In its psychological nature this is a process of associative synthesis: it consists in the fusion of both groups of sensations into a product, whose elementary components are no longer separable from each other in idea. In melting wholly away into the product which they create they become consciously undistinguishable, and the mind apprehends only their resultant, the intuition of space. Thus there obtains a certain analogy between this psychic synthesis and that chemical synthesis which out of simple bodies generates a compound that appears to our immediate perception as a homogeneous whole with new properties. &#x27;&#x27;&quot;[James, William *Principles of Psychology*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The same may be done in all our complex ideas whatsoever; which, however compounded and decompounded, may at last be resolved into simple ideas, which are all the materials of knowledge or thought we have, or can have. Nor shall we have reason to fear that the mind is hereby stinted to too scanty a number of ideas, if we consider what an inexhaustible stock of simple modes number and figure alone afford us. How far then mixed modes, which admit of the various combinations of different simple ideas, and their infinite modes, are from being few and scanty, we may easily imagine.&quot;[Locke, John *Complete Works of John Locke*. Delphi Classics, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;This is called ABSTRACTION, whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general representatives of all of the same kind; and their names general names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas. Such precise, naked appearances in the mind, without considering how, whence, or with what others they came there, the understanding lays up (with names commonly annexed to them) as the standards to rank real existences into sorts, as they agree with these patterns, and to denominate them accordingly.&quot;[Locke, John *Complete Works of John Locke*. Delphi Classics, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;This book has four divisions: risings of Consciousness, and the rest. The division on risings of Consciousness is twofold: Table of contents and Classification of terms. Of these, the table of contents comes first and is diyided into the table of triplets and the table of couplets. Of these, the table of triplets comes first and the triplet headed by moral states is the first therein. In the triplet headed by moral states, the words ‘ moral states ’ are the first. Hence, Ye faithful, with devout and single mind This subtle Abhidhamma discourse hear.&quot;[Tin, Pe Maung *The Expositor (Atthasalini)*. PTS, 1976.]</li>
<li>&quot;But as these perceptions are each of them simple and indivisible, they can never give us the idea of extension, (p. 58) He offers here the examples of two luminous objects against a dark background, and the blue sky seen between my fingers when I hold up my hand, as possible cases from which the idea of empty space might be derived (pp. 56-58). He gives a careful analysis of these visual examples, and of some similar tangible ones, to show that the sensations experienced are the same whether visible objects are interposed between other objects (showing the distance between them, a filled distance) or not.&quot;[Yolton, John W. *Perceptual Acquaintance from Descartes to Reid*. 1984.]</li>
<li>&quot;This we describe as the retention of the direct past, and it will generally last for the few moments that constitute the first phase of memory formation. But we cannot hold the immediate past in its living phase for long. We soon transfer it to the second phase of memory formation. In this process of transfer, a new first nen will look at the scene of the accident that is projected by the third nen, and the process will form a circuit from the first series of three nen to the second series and then to a third series, and so on.&quot;[Sekida, Kazuki, and A. V Grimstone *Zen Training: Methods and Philosophy*. Boston: Shambhala Publications, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Similarly, Benjamin Libet (1987, 271), in the Encyclopedia of Neuroscience, deﬁnes consciousness as “conscious, subjective experience” and characterizes it further as “subjective awareness and experience, whether it be sensory experiences of our environment, external and internal, or subjective experience of our feelings and thoughts, or simply awareness of our own existing self and presence in the world. ” There is simply no way to translate such ideas (without distortion) into, for example, Russian because Russian has no word with a range corresponding to that described by Chalmers or Libet.&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*. Oxford, Toronto: Oxford University Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Even now we can seldom define the optical signs which lead us to infer the shapes and distances of the objects which by their aid we so unhesitatingly perceive. The objects, too, when thus inferred, are general objects. The dog crossing a scent thinks of a deer in general, or of another dog in general, not of a particular deer or dog. To these most primitive abstract objects Dr. G. J. Romanes gives the name of recepts or generic ideas, to distinguish them from concepts and general ideas properly so called.&quot;[James, William *Principles of Psychology*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;In what follows, I discuss in some detail seven distinct senses of the word, which fall into two broad groups. One of these groups, which includes older meanings, involves past experience and knowledge accumulated over time; the other includes more recent meanings and has to do with current experience. Thus, the semantic history of experience can be summarized as follows: Experience: An Overview A. Past experience, accumulated knowledge 1. a doer’s accumulated knowledge 2. an undergoer’s accumulated knowledge 3. an observer’s accumulated knowledge B.&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*. Oxford, Toronto: Oxford University Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;There is no question here of the concurrent thought that “this is happening to me now,” and the resulting knowledge can be put into words. Judging by the material in Literature Online, however, in the course of the eighteenth century a very different kind of sentence with the verb to experience emerged and spread in English; one that linked this verb with the noun sensation (or sensations) in particular.&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*.
