    <pre>This results in a compulsory simplicity that through ever more added details gives the suggestion of complexity. What looks like the accumulation of complexity is often a complexity of specification, not of thought. This pipeline privileges what can be discretised and verified in a single model while displacing modes of architectural reasoning that operate atmospherically, culturally, historically, and theoretically. In other words, the model has become the law from without, and too often the project is asked to reproduce its given form. When Vitruvius talks about the education of the Architect, he portrays the complexity of architecture as being provided by its inherent multi-facetted nature - Let him be educated, skilful with the pencil, instructed in geometry, know much history, have followed the philosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of medicine, know the opinions of the jurists, and be acquainted with astronomy and the theory of the heavens. Yet the prevailing computational encoding habits tend to confine mediation to geometry, letting the non-geometrical dimensions of architecture fall through the digital cracks. It does not allow for the integration of the theoretical, cultural, literary, atmospheric, philosophical and associative dimensions of architectural design or for the flexibility of the design as an idea when mediated by the designer. The consequence of this is not just representational; it is epistemic. Architecture risks forgetting how its media think. In his essay on translations from drawing to building, Robin Evans speaks of the two roles drawings can play within the architectural process:&quot;The two options, one emphasizing the corporeal properties of things made, the other concentrating on the disembodied properties in the drawing, are diametrically opposed: in the one corner, involvement, substantiality, tangibility, presence, immediacy, direct action; in the other, disengagement, obliqueness, abstraction, mediation and action at a distance.&quot;. Evanss polarity, corporeal involvement versus disembodied abstraction, maps neatly onto our contemporary dilemma. The profession has excelled at the first the tangible model and its deliverables, while the second abstraction as mediating intelligence remains under-instrumentalised in computational practice. Rightly so, Evans does continue to state that although they are &quot;opposed&quot; they are not &quot;necessarily incompatible&quot;. The challenge, then, is to find this compatibility of the corporeal and the abstracted within the digital. To recover the disembodied capacities as operations that relate unlike domains such as drawing, narrative, atmosphere, code, without collapsing them into sameness. Therefore the thinking of architectural modes of media is proposed to be brought into the computational before we can consider how it can be returned onto architecture itself. In contrast to the computational geometrical model in architecture, in digital contexts, space need not be a three-dimensional container at all, but an n-dimensional arrangement of features where relations are learned as proximities and projections. The crucial step is the encoding that makes such spaces operable, an encoding that can and we will argue should include cultural and contextual signals beyond 3D geometry.

<em>This encoding, which Vitruvius had already implicitly described as a process of cultural and historical embedding, has to be rethought within the digital context. It requires a shift from the representation of buildings as static forms to a representation of buildings as processes, as transformations, as temporal and spatial flows. In this sense, architecture becomes not only a matter of constructing walls and floors but also of designing the relationships between spaces, between materials, between users, and between technologies. This transformation of the architectural project can only be achieved by acknowledging the importance of the non-geometrical dimensions, such as the cultural, the historical, the theoretical, the atmospheric, and the philosophical dimensions.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;Think on the continued use of diagrams from Durand to Eisenman or the emergence of 2D computer drawing and the digital stratiﬁcation of information into layers and projects in strata such as Tschumi’s La Villette Park. Consider also the signiﬁcant change introduced by virtual modeling and the truly three-dimensional conception of architecture with blobs and folds—not a mere extruded space. Reflect on the development of scripting languages and parametric design, or on the topological notions applied to the concept of open form, algorithmic architecture and the natural counterpoint of digital manufacturing to enhance the materialization of this new digitally borne architecture: a brave new architecture addressing a new notion of materiality.&quot;[Marcos, Carlos L. *Graphic Imprints*.

<li>&quot;Contemporary computer software deals with bi-dimensional representation, three-dimensional dynamic spatial representation, augmented virtual reality and time-based formal topology animations in discrete conventional terms. If spatial organization plays an essential role at a cognitive level, presenting limits to how disciplines measure different space-time paradigms, today, architects should be able to contribute novel algorithms, techniques and concepts of modes of representation to investigations in other ﬁelds conducting research on multidimensional space.&quot;[Marcos, Carlos L. *Graphic Imprints*.

<li>&quot;She argues that the paradigm shift from mechanical to digital architecture fundamentally changes relations between depth and surface, the inside and the outside. Evoking Deleuze&#x27;s notion of the fold and Elizabeth Grosz&#x27;s work on architecture, Wegenstein argues that the outside is no longer a reftection of the inside but a virtual condition ofit. Another prominent feature ofboth digital architecture and digital art is the incorporation ofinteractivity, unpredictability, and audience participation, all of which create new intersections between corporeal, digital, and the collective unconscious.&quot;[Oosterling, Henk, and Ewa Plonowska Ziarek (eds.) *Intermedialities: Philosophy, Arts, Politics*.

<li>&quot;IO) the  close alignment (but not quite identity) between drawing and building is at once obvious. This is the kind of architecture that so much  fascinated Alberti: a massive, monumental architecture engendered  from the etiolated, reduced, bodyless elements of &#x27;lines and angles  which comprise and form the face of the building&#x27;; 21 an architecture  made through drawing and made of the same species of illusion as is to  be found in drawing. For into its patterns of lines stopping and starting we project, by a well understood reflex of overdetermination,l 1 a  deeper space.&quot;[INPUT: Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;It requires perception } of thermal and luminous phenomenon that are not visible in the same sense as architectural space. Boundaries in the thermal or luminous environment are subtle and not sharply defined. 33 Whereas architecture as building emphasizes an iconic image—singularity and static fixity, the metaphors of architecture as organism and architecture as furnishing a larger room suggest a dynamic, open, less formal and more fluid style. By demanding recognition of something beyond the work itself these metaphors critically promote the architectural function as the intertwining of making and world producing the spatial potentiality for the intertwining of (human) organisms and environment.&quot;[(auth.), Gary Backhaus, Gary Backhaus, and John Murungi (eds.) *Symbolic Landscapes*.

<li>&quot;As the architect structures his program, design and specifications he simultaneously structures the metaphor of his work of architecture. Architecture consists of program specifics where the conditions, operations, goals and ideals are from heretofore unrelated and distant contexts but are themselves metaphors “mapped across conceptual domains”. Architects translate their architectural conception from philosophy, psychology, sociology, etc. into two dimensional scaled drawings and then to real life full-scale multi-dimension conventions consisting of conventional materials, building elements (doors, windows, stairs, etc. ).&quot;[Fez-Barringten, Barie, and Edward Hart *Architecture: The Making of Metaphors*.

<li>&quot;Srygley interprets the main street-like development as presenting an allegory that critiques both the suburban landscape that it extols and the urban landscape that it shuns. It presents this allegory through the architectural oxymoron of a private public space. Nevertheless, due to an urban, historical amnesia, whereby people no longer understand what quality urban space is about, this allegorical critique is not experienced, rather, the ersatz main street makes for a “successful” con. It is precisely the absence of a veritable embodied urban experience that allows for a cheap imitation “to work. ” In chapter eight, “Metaphor, Environmental Receptivity, and Architectural Design,” Brook Muller discusses the important role of metaphor in architectural design.&quot;[(auth.), Gary Backhaus, Gary Backhaus, and John Murungi (eds.) *Symbolic Landscapes*. Springer Netherlands, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Rowe argued against object-form in building and for formed external urban spaces. The correct formal partnership of architecture and urban design could be achieved if buildings did not attempt to have form as objects but rather acted to form exterior spaces. To demonstrate this he compared a ‘Nolli’ plan of Parma and Le Corbusier’s unbuilt plan for the city of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. 22 In the latter there are buildings of generic and specific forms sited in a uniform field. Here space is merely displaced around the buildings.&quot;[Dorrian, Mark, and Frédéric Poussin (eds.) *Seeing from Above: The Aerial View in Visual Culture*. I.B.Tauris, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;By very definition design is a metaphor. It is one thing to research, observe, analyze and program but another to compose these findings into metaphors and finally a single metaphor called a work of architecture. Ideally the general metaphor of the end user begets the metaphor which initializes the design process while during the design process one metaphor begets another. The process is triangulated from both the top down and the bottom up. The way metaphors are charted and combined horizontally and vertically are metaphoric insofar as each metaphor makes the strange familiar and maps one metaphor in terms of another.&quot;[Fez-Barringten, Barie, and Edward Hart *Architecture: The Making of Metaphors*. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;But the slippage into the dystopic may also help explain why the architectural imaginary that peoples such utopic visions almost invariably produces an architecture of direct control (architecture as that which directly or neutrally facilitates the subject’s control over its political and natural environment), an architecture of political inﬂexibility. Until the dimension of time or duration has an impact on the ways in which architecture is theorized and practiced, the utopic, with its dual impossibility and necessity, will remain outside architectural reach and beyond its effect.&quot;[Grosz, Elizabeth *Architecture from the Outside: Essays on Virtual and Real Space (Writing Architecture)*. 2001.]</li>
