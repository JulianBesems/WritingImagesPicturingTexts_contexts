    <pre>4.1.1 FLOOR . . the floor. Thats right. The floor. Its typically the largest horizontal surface in the room and undeniably the most used. The floor is a site of the body in extremis. In tragic history plays and epics, at the point of climax, characters must keel over or fall over backwards onto the floor. As an element, what role does it play?

<em>It is the threshold between the vertical and the horizontal, the boundary between the up and the down. It is the stage for the drama of life, where the characters of our daily routines play out their scenes. It is the place where we come to rest, to recharge, and to refuel for the next act.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;The place where the coffin briefly rests is located exactly on the threshold. For the moment it stops in the lychgate the coffin is poised symbolically between this world and the next, on the threshold of eternity.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Where Worlds Meet A doorway is where an inside meets the outside. As such, all thresholds are to some extent points of contact, overlap and interaction between different states of being, paradigms, social categories.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;It provides a good example of the ‘in-between’. The whole building can be considered an in-between place in that it is a place for saying goodbye.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;extreme &quot;That in the floor I lay, as I were deed. &quot;— Chaucer, Canterbury Tales. 27 The floor is a site of the body in extremis. In tragic history plays and epics, at the point of climax,  characters must keel over or fall over backwards onto the floor. Over and over in Homer&#x27;s  &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The problem with X-ray vision is that it takes for granted, but cannot explain, the constitution of a spatial continuum. The territory between a foreground and a background ﬁgure is an element of both separation and connection, the place where one passes into or onto the next.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;The total whiteness is an effacement, an obliteration—a neutral element, like a road leading to a place of rest. It is as if one were in a cavern, hidden away, a place where one rediscovers one’s origins and roots.&quot;[Clifton-Mogg, Caroline *Hidden Paris.  Discovering and Exploring Parisian Interiors*. Gibbs Smith, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;We identify ourselves with this space, this place, this moment and these dimensions become ingredients of our very existence. Architecture is the art of reconciliation between ourselves and the world, and this mediation takes place through the senses.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;While the ground floor always contains services such as storage, stables, baths, servants&#x27; quarters, and the first floor is the residence proper, we also find houses with horizontal separation of functions on ground and upper floors, having different stairs serving each part.&quot;[Ragette, Friedrich *Traditional Domestic Architecture Of The Arab Region*. Hardcover. Axel Menges, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;When the natural landscape is replaced by the urban, the window as a place for viewing out becomes also the place where others peer in. The transformation of the singular (outward) view into potentially reciprocating views (looking at and being looked at) thus destabilized conventional understandings of the function of windows.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is not just a different place, but a place that no longer exists at all. Our primitive psyches were not wired for that knowledge. Where once existed a familiar home, favorite shop, or longtime office, a place whose microcosm of geography we could easily and comfortably navigate (it’s out the door, down the hall, on the left. . . ), now there is a void.&quot;[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America&#x27;s Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Riser pipe A vertical pipe which rises from one floor level to another floor level, for the purpose of conducting steam, water, or gas from one floor to another.&quot;[Ernest., Burden *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The floor cavity is formed by the workplane, the floor, and the wall surfaces between them. Floor drain A fixture providing an opening in the floor to drain water into a plumbing system.&quot;[Ernest., Burden *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;PAGE 80 FLOOR 2013 Floor&#x27;s-eye view: an apartment seen from the bottom-up in Michael H. Rohde&#x27;s einblick mit absicht. in making object form, the floor is a medium of active forms that organize interplay and interdependence with spatial consequence.&quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;By vertical separation of functions the services are on the ground floor and the living quarters on the upper floor. The hall is reached by an external stair and it opens to a terrace in front.&quot;[Ragette, Friedrich *Traditional Domestic Architecture Of The Arab Region*. Hardcover. Axel Menges, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;This shares its roots with the French ambiance, translated as atmosphere in English, and the English use of ambiance (or ambience) that is defined as ‘the character and atmosphere of a place’ (OED), and atmosphere, in its non-scientific sense, is ‘the pervading tone or mood of a place’ (OED).&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
