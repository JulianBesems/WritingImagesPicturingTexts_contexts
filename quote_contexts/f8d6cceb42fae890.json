Vitruvius, for instance, in his De Architectura, famously described the ideal proportions of the human body and how they could be applied to the design of buildings. Alberti's treatise on architecture, De Re Aedificatoria, also acknowledged the importance of proportion and the role of the human body in shaping architectural form. TSCHUMI, in his work, has repeatedly emphasized the need for a more nuanced understanding of space, one that takes into account not just geometry but also the social and cultural contexts in which buildings are used. ANDO's architecture has often been characterized by its use of curves and organic forms, which, while rooted in geometry, also acknowledge the complexity of human experience. Similarly, KOOLHAAS's work has consistently pushed the boundaries of what is possible through the use of unconventional forms and materials. And, finally, ISHIGAMI's architecture often incorporates elements of nature, such as plants and water, which, while not strictly geometric, still require a deep understanding of spatial relationships. These masters have all recognized that architecture is not just about geometry, but about the complex interplay", "suggest_context": "In this condition the 3D model can be seen as a universal model that connects all representations. This connection is defined by means of the Cartesian coordinate system through linear projection, dictated by the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Euclidean geometry as defined in Euclids work Elements is presented as an abstraction of physical space, and as such was initially bound to 3 dimensions . Elements, historically an abstraction, thus effectively bound geometry to three dimensions; and through the CADBIM stacks prominent position of the digital platform for architecture, the discipline in turn inherits that encoding, even as mathematics has has long since generalised the axioms of Elements to n-dimensions. The Cartesian coordinate system serves as one means of an encoding of this space by being able to refer to specific points in space by means of a set of orthogonal coordinates, an alternative is for instance polar coordinates. The linear connection from 3D model to a plan, section or even render is calculated based on these orthogonal coordinates by projecting them onto a single plane. By connecting all models of communication, it could be argued that through the 3D model the architectural object has been internalised into the Cartesian system in its entirety. Singular, and with no abstraction, the architecture is internalised within computation. Further development in this direction is that of the digital twin, where the digital seeks to be identical to the physical manifestation of the architecture. The issue is that the architectural project has never been exhausted by geometry alone.
