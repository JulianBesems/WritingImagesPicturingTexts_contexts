      <li>&quot;However, each line type must mean something. It might mean an existing wall, or a wall to be, or even a new wall. Figure 8. 54 shows an example of pochéd walls. Stairs An arrow is used on the plan of the stair to show the direction in which the stair rises. See the partial floor plan in Figure 8. 55. Notice how the arrowheads show direction and how the number and size of the treads and risers are indicated.&quot;[Wakita, Osamu A., Richard M. Linde, and Nagy R. Bakhoum *The Professional Practice of Architectural Working Drawings, 5th Edition*. 5th ed. Wiley, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The actual windows in the inner skin are not aligned with the five empty window openings in the outer wall. The difference 6 between the vertical rhythms of both walls emphasizes the phase shift 7 between both skins, allowing reading the outer wall as being the mask, the 8 inner wall as being the face behind it. 9 Skin and mask belong to different sets of signiﬁers but are suscep- 10 tible to a similar semiotic effect.&quot;[Baydar, Gilsum *Negotiating Domesticity  Spatial productions of gender in modern architecture*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;The course of the outer wall of the gallery is deﬁnitely aligned with and determined by the natural contour of the mountain at this point. The inner wall is built to match the outer wall and the result is the 19 Wiener, op. cit. , p. 152, gives a fanciful reconstruction of the section of wall at b in ﬁgure 11. He has placed the doorway under a window, an economy of draftsmanship if not of the imagination.&quot;[McCown, Theodore D. *Pre-Incaic Huamachuco: Survey and excavations in the region of Huamachuco and Cajabamba*.

<li>&quot;The four hidden lines shown in this convention represent an interior bearing footing for a slab‐on‐grade system. If the stem wall and width of the footing vary from location to location, dimensions for them are indicated right at the location on the foundation plan. A masonry retaining wall. As in the previous example, the plan view could be dimensioned if these walls are of varying sizes throughout a structure.&quot;[Wakita, Osamu A., Richard M. Linde, and Nagy R.

<li>&quot;In this connection they may have served as supports for scaffolding, but this ex- planation seems to me somewhat problematical. The wall shown at c in ﬁgure 11 closely follows the curvature of the inner wall of the circular gallery but 2. 5 m. internal to it. The eastern end of this third curved wall is complete and intact. It gives the appearance of being a curtain wall, but its situation is such that this term seems a misnomer because so far as can be seen it does not screen or protect anything, placed as it is inside the fortress.&quot;[McCown, Theodore D. *Pre-Incaic Huamachuco: Survey and excavations in the region of Huamachuco and Cajabamba*.

<li>&quot;The transition phase of the process is described first and in full detail; some comments on drawing quality and presentation technique are added as a natural supplement to the planning process. The graphic language of the floor plan is directly related to the additional drawings that normally accompany it, particularly elevations and sections. Drawing elements, such as line weight, notations, and poché (a French word pronounced “po-SHAY”), in the floor plan drawing are common to any full set of preliminary drawings of interior design projects.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics, 4th Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;Obviously the intention was to create the effect of vistas through the wall, such as later appeared in wall paintings of the Second Pompeian Style. The entrance to the kline chamber reflects the same concept. In this case, the wall is decorated with a small tetrastyle Ionic temple facade supporting a low pediment; this scheme recalls the facades of Macedonian tombs.&quot;[Fedak, Janos *Monumental Tombs of the Hellenistic Age: A Study of Selected Tombs from the Pre-Classical to the Early Imperial Era*.

<li>&quot;Illustrations 7–1 and 7–2, of a refined and completed preliminary floor plan (developed from the rough floor plan shown in Illustration 6–11), represent a very simplified and bare-bones approach to the final step in the initial planning process. Note that Illustration 7–1 uses a conventional CAD-drawn technique, although the same graphic result could easily be accomplished with a conventional hand-drafted technique.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics, 4th Edition*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;1537 Triumph of the  wall: after millennia  playing second fiddle  to the column in the  classical imagination,  Serlio depicts the wall  engulfing the column  like a creeping plant,  taking over both its  structural and symbolic  role. The place assigned by Alberti to the  column is implicitly contradicted by  a passage in which he defines the  column as &#x27;a certain strengthened part  of the wall, carried up perpendicularly  from the foundation to the top,&#x27; and  &#x27;a row of columns is indeed nothing  else but a wall, open and discontinued  in several places. &#x27;&quot;[INPUT: wall.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;Thermal insulation was found missing at glazing/wall assembly interfaces (due to the nature of the construction detail). The glazing unit was located at a vertical plane flush with the exterior of the wall assembly, whereas the vertical plane of thermal insulation within the steel stud framing was located to the interior of the wall assembly (Figure 78).&quot;[Bomberg, Mark, and Joseph W.

<li>&quot;1/25/11 5:43 PM Chapter 9 • Floor and Wall Framing / 223 Figure 9. 3 The concept of platform framing, shown in cross section, reading from left to right: A foundation wall is constructed. A ground-floor platform is framed and sheathed. Ground-floor wall frames are assembled horizontally on the platform and then tilted into their final positions. A second-floor platform is constructed on top of the ground-floor walls, and the process of wall construction is repeated.&quot;[Allen, Edward, and Rob Thallon *Fundamentals of Residential Construction*. 3rd ed.

<li>&quot;Progress quickly improved that summer. 57 The famous Castello Plan of New Amsterdam in 1660 includes a detailed perspective drawing of Fort Amsterdam (see Figure 8. 5). Along the inside of the west curtain wall is a two-storey barracks building; the governor’s house is opposite, inside the east curtain wall. The church is inside the north curtain wall, just west of the main gate, although much smaller than it appears in earlier views.&quot;[Klingelhofer, Eric C *First forts : essays on the archaeology of proto-colonial fortifications*. Leiden ; Boston: Brill, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Kosny and Desjarlais (1994) define a clear wall area as the part of the wall system free of thermal anomalies such as corners, window and door openings or joints with other structural elements. In the discussed case, because of the wood framing, the RSI 3. 5 (R20) wall becomes an RSI 3. 1 (R 17. 6) wall. Historically, the shift from extensive measurements of heat transmission through the structures (Pratt, 1969) to computer calculations (Kosny, 1995) was slow.&quot;[Bomberg, Mark, and Joseph W. Lstiburek *Spray polyurethane foam in external envelopes of buildings*. CRC Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;The semicircular feature in particular is highly significant as it is doubtless the base of an externallyprojecting wall tower. To the east of the old mosque, a large portion of a thick, but heavily eroded wall stands several metres high. This seems to align with the wall remains at the south-west end of the old mosque and it is joined to another similar high wall which is oriented north–south.&quot;[Bagnall, Roger S., Paola Davoli, and Colin A.

<li>&quot;Walls as Bracing Figure 9. 31 Basic procedure for wall framing. The corner and intersecting wall details indicated in the middle drawing are shown in Figure 9. 30. JWBT418-09. indd 237 The wall sheathing, which is made of rigid panels (usually OSB), acts as permanent bracing for the walls and is applied as soon as possible after the wall is framed. Many builders apply sheathing to each wall while it still lies flat on the floor platform.&quot;[Allen, Edward, and Rob Thallon *Fundamentals of Residential Construction*. 3rd ed. Hoboken, N.J: John Wiley and Sons, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Example: The following floor plan was agreed upon by the builder and the owner. After the price is negotiated, the owner would like to add an additional wall as shown in Fig. 25. 17. Additional wall Fig. 25. 17 Plan view. The contractor is entitled to a change order to construct the additional wall. 25. 21. 2 Unexpected Field Conditions Sometimes unexpected field conditions could occur.&quot;[Rajapakse, Ruwan Abey *Construction Engineering Design Calculations and Rules of Thumb*.

<li>&quot;The cut pieces should be placed on alternate sides of the wall corner in successive courses so as to achieve the running bond pattern. Figures 5. 11 through 5. 14 illustrate how to place units at a wall corner to meet the 50 percent interlock requirement when the walls are of the same thickness. Figure 5. 15 shows methods of providing interlock when the wall thicknesses at a corner are different.&quot;[Jaffe, Rochelle C. *Masonry Instant Answers*. McGraw-Hill, 2004.]</li>
