    <pre>Multimodality in the context of architecture can therefore be understood as a structuring condition of architectural thought, more complex than as a simple coexistence of domains. Each mode - plan, section, model, image, text - carries its own semiotic logic and operational affordances. Rather than dissolving into a unified representation, these modalities sustain architectural reasoning through their interplay and disjunction. As Gunther Kress argues on multimodality in the process of learning in general, each mode brings distinct potentials shaped by its material and cultural history: *&quot;While speech is based on the logic of time, (still) image is based on the logic of space. [...] In image, meaning is made by the positioning of elements in that space; but also by size, colour, line and shape. Image does not ‘have’ words; it uses ‘depictions’. Words can be ‘spoken’ or ‘written’, images are ‘displayed’. [...] Meaning relations are established by the spatial arrangement of entities in a framed space and the kinds of relation between the depicted entities.&quot;* In architecture, this supports the notion that drawing, modelling, writing, and narration do not overlap but align momentarily through acts of design. The architect’s work lies in composing their proportionality, producing meaning by exploring the resonances and tensions that emerge across modes, an operation that extends beyond that of translating between the different notations of geometry. Modalities define not only what is represented but how thought itself is organised and communicated. This orchestration extends into communication and discourse as well. The architectural project is not finished when built; it is continuously mediated through publications, exhibitions, arguments, and critique; each constituting yet another modality.</pre>

    <div class="selected">This last notion follows a univocalization of mimesis, indeed a univocalization of being, in which image and original are congealed into a too fixed one-to-one correspondence. Mimesis is a relation, and hence has a dynamic of relating at work in it. The complexity of the relation has to do less with some univocal visual mirroring than a balanced relativity between an image and an original. That relation is double rather than univocal, indeed plurivocal in that an openness is necessarily inserted between original and image.[Desmond, William *Art, Origins, Otherness: Between Philosophy and Art  (Paperback) - Common*.

<li>&quot;That is, nothing has yet been written concerning the pairing of the concepts of ‘representation’ and ‘presentation’ in relation to the image in Deleuze, yet this is crucial to an understanding of the nature of the image. The purpose of this chapter is to look at the role of the image, from a cognitive perspective, as an interaction between notions of ‘presentation’ and ‘representation’, and to use this distinction in order to begin to develop an understanding of how the image might work in art.&quot;[Uhlmann, Anthony *Samuel Beckett and the Philosophical Image*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Further, the image as presentation has at least two possible forms: a) the extracted image, the autonomous mental image (in the manner of Francis Bacon), and b) the direct presentation, the nonrepresented image (in the manner of Proust). One can compare this with the Stoic understanding, which we will encounter in chapter 7, and which strongly attracts Deleuze, who uses it extensively in The Logic of Sense.&quot;[Uhlmann, Anthony *Samuel Beckett and the Philosophical Image*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;This last notion follows a univocalization of mimesis, indeed a univocalization of being, in which image and original are congealed into a too fixed one-to-one correspondence. Mimesis is a relation, and hence has a dynamic of relating at work in it. The complexity of the relation has to do less with some univocal visual mirroring than a balanced relativity between an image and an original. That relation is double rather than univocal, indeed plurivocal in that an openness is necessarily inserted between original and image.&quot;[Desmond, William *Art, Origins, Otherness: Between Philosophy and Art  (Paperback) - Common*.

<li>&quot;The DVTD is a multimodal speech act which coherently articulates the different sign systems available, in this case study, in an online paper which organizes the audiovisual production. This results in the recognition of a process of meaning-making that exceeds the discourse itself and articulates the technological resources involved; it also creates an aesthetic that grants specific features to discursive expressions. Most recent practices in documentary video production, via the TD genre, potentially use the resource of intertextuality through the articulation of moving image and still/moving image, whose origins were not necessarily foreseen as part of the new unit of meaning.&quot;[Bankov, Kristian, and Paul Cobley *Semiotics and its masters. Volume 1.*. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;From this perspective, design is simply speculative without an understanding of how and why it works; theory makes design real, because it places design in a context that explains it. Whichever position we hold, though, a working relationship between theoretical understanding and design practice is crucial. In this spirit, the theoretical explorations of the last few chapters are intended to ground design efforts in a variety of ways to be explored here. First, they should provide a common vocabulary and conceptual apparatus for thinking about design opportunities and design features.&quot;[Dourish, Paul *Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction (Bradford Books)*. The MIT Press, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;123  and intelligible. This fourfold can be extended to  “space” and “time. ” The image provides a “verse”  through entropie and syntropic time; within the  “face” of the image, both directions are simultaneously present: the image acts as a fulcrum or as a focal point to which time converges and from which  it departs. 39 Simultaneously, it articulates a here and  there, an outside and an inside, a closeness (philid)  and a distance (xenid). 40 As a “thought in act,” the image “is not the expression of a subjectivity but the  reality of a composition with something that one is  not!&quot;[INPUT: Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The virtual is implicit in Deleuze&#x27;s discussion of the image, but comes increasingly to the fore as he details the perception-image, action-image and affection-image; for these images are sorted according to their unfolding of a relation between actual and virtual. At its &#x27;purest&#x27; perception would be fully actual; eye and image would coincide, there would be no idea of, or perception of, what is imaged. There would be nothing other than the meeting point of eye and light. But such a non-relational, immediate and full image is not what we usually understand by perception (and the whole point of Deleuze&#x27;s emphasis on life as imaging is that we are always dealing with perceptions that are relational, directed 58 THE MOVEMENT-IMAGE with some anticipation or virtual surplus).&quot;[Colebrook, Claire *Deleuze: A Guide for the Perplexed*. Continuum, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is the pure image (the schema is a non-sensible image) by which, in general, an image is possible, that is, by which the unity and unicity of a representation are possible. The subject produces unity—that is, its own unity as subject-of-arepresentation—as successive. That is its primary schematism, or its pure imagination, the condition of possibility of any image, of any (re)presentation: the condition for their being an image, and not a Masked Imagination 81 chaotic flux (without this singular image being simply one and unified: what it does, simply, is present itself).&quot;[Nancy, Jean-Luc *The Ground of the Image*. New York: Fordham University Press, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Often the reverse phenomenon, that of concept leading image, is construed either as exemplification of a conceptual claim (or hypothesis), or else as mere decoration. However, there are subtleties here too. On occasion the cumulative weight of concepts preceding the presentation of an image gives point to describing the passage as one in which concept leads image, nevertheless the image itself may have the power to modify our way of seeing the domain specified by the concepts—an example no doubt, but a telling one.&quot;[Warner, Martin *The Aesthetics of Argument*. Hardcover. Oxford University Press, USA, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Readers are encouraged to follow up the references at the end of this chapter. When developing a scheme of information design in a given context, designers should realize that they are developing visual ‘languages’. The visual language of information design is an important part of these. Designers will imbue colours, shapes and layouts with meanings that people have to come to understand. 24. 2 Metaphors in design Section 10. 2 discusses metaphor Another key aspect of information design is finding an appropriate metaphor.&quot;[Benyon, David, Phil Turner, and Susan Turner *Designing Interactive Systems: People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies*. Addison Wesley, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;By holistic, I mean that it sees interaction within a larger frame, often a cultural frame, and recognizes that an interactive artifact must be designed as a part of this larger system. By expressive, I mean that it recognizes the ways in which design and design motifs express systems of values. Design communicates . So a key component of interaction design involves considering the message that the design should communicate and how this relates both to the task at hand and to the details of the design.&quot;[Dourish, Paul *Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction (Bradford Books)*. The MIT Press, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;These specific cases are the strongest candidates for useful applications in multiple design contexts. Design actions, design patterns, and interaction metaphors provide non-prescriptive frameworks for design thinking (iv). 6. 2 Goals of Ubimus Design Ubiquitous music (ubimus) research (Keller et al. 2011a) has also targeted aspects of interaction design that have not been dealt with within the mainstream humancomputer interaction perspectives. Ubiquitous music deals with systems of human agents and material resources that afford musical activities through sustainable creativity support tools.&quot;[Zagalo, Nelson, and Pedro Branco (eds.) *Creativity in the Digital Age*. Springer-Verlag London, 2015.]</li>
