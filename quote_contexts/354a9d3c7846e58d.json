But there is something where the technology becomes ornament, in the sense that it conveys grandure, or hosts spectacle. First through structure becoming decorative with Rogers and Piano, Gehry, and so on, but now I think we're past that as well. Instead the absence of structure is the decorative more, see the large span of Ishigami's table, or Nishizawa's Naoshima museum, which very silently is the largest shell structure: decoration through absence. The purity of the surface without anything else. So here the surface has internalised the ornamentation beyond the visibly identifiable, but in it's own content.", "suggested_query": "", "suggest_context": "Although ornamentation might have gone out of fashion a bit in the modern \"stile\", we also have to admit that people still love decoration, most notably the most intimate surface of a person is more and more subject to decoration: the skin."}
