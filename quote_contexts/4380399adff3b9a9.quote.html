    <pre>At this point, the distance to the contemporary digital condition described by Hovestadt becomes clear. In the introduction to Atlas of Digital Architecture he insists that information technology “touches, it infuses, inhabits, everything,” and that “absolutely everything we do and have today is in one way or another possessed of digitality.” &quot;Today&quot;, he writes, *&quot;we have an abundance of images, indexes, references,&quot;* and “digitality is reaching omnipresence,” such that the real challenge is not growing complexity but an overwhelming simplicity in which “it’s not us who understand computers any longer, it’s computers that understand us,” leading to saturation rather than scarcity. In such a saturated, generic field, architectures, models and images circulate as part of a shared, indexed background. The projects we recognise as masterpieces do not prefigure this condition, but they show why a purely geometric encoding is insufficient: each already depends on disciplinary memory, narrative, atmosphere and use in excess of its measurable form. These extra-geometric operations are precisely what allow such works to persist, to be re-read and re-indexed within today’s digital abundance. In this sense, digital architectural encodings dealing with the non-geometrical cannot rely only on a structuralist idea of form as total code; they must also register the fluid, indexical and sometimes misaligned operations through which architecture participates in this digitally saturated field. The emphasis thus shifts from what is modelled to how we think with models: what kinds of games, stories, projections and mis-readings our digital instruments permit.</pre>

      <li>&quot;Consider how common it is today to take computer language as a paradigm for language as such. When we take computer language as a model for all language, we then see language as a set of rules that, if followed, allows one to produce in another an intended representation or response, just as a programming language 52 C. CULBERTSON allows one to successfully communicate instructions to a machine. Given how common it is for linguistic research to approach language in this way, it is striking to hear in Heidegger’s dialogue that language, in its essence, speaks like a hint or a gesture.&quot;[Marsh, Leslie *Walker Percy, Philosopher*.

<li>&quot;In fact, I would suggest that it simply has a generic association with &quot;antique&quot; or, at best, &#x27;&#x27;classical&quot; to the average viewer today. This architectural language that purportedly communicates meaning better than modernism did is in fact more like Esperanto than any &quot;natural&quot; language, and what communication it manages occurs in fragments to a small, elite population. But what are the theoretical underpinnings of this definition of meaning?&quot;[Shapiro, Gary *After the Future: Postmodern Times and Places*. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990.]</li>
<li>&quot;In digital form, the surface is released from any single referential point, and is rather perceived from multiple referential points. If the modernists approached the Dom-ino frame as the logos of form, the fold operates in a perceptual field in which the image is emancipated from any deep structure. Speaking of the need to articulate a different relation between architecture and technology, John Rajchman suggests that, contrary to the Bauhaus approach to technology, computer-generated images show the ‘detachment of form, in the sort of contortions between random and the regular that electronic modelling makes possible’.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;This new condition of textualization within Internet language, and the layers of translation and transit required in online communication, reroute my discussion back to an earlier debate on the transformation of natural languages and the mutation of alphabetic writing into moving, animated, and ultimately postalphabetic forms of textual communication. Text moves not only because it can be animated, however, but because the language behind this written representation is also moving, shifting, alternating from one language domain to another.&quot;[Sutil, Nicolás Salazar *Motion and Representation: The Language of Human Movement*. The MIT Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Whether internally, within the logic of form, for example, or externally, within  that of form and use, these disjunctive levels break apart any possible balance or  synthesis.  In  their  individual  state,  objects,  movements,  events  are  simply  discontinuous. Only when they unite do they establish an instant of continuity.  Such disjunction implies a dynamic conception posed against a static definition of  architecture, an excessive movement that brings architecture to its limits. Notation &quot;[INPUT: Tschumi - 1994 - The Manhattan transcripts.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;This spatial determination of language can be questioned, however, by adding further dimensions to thought, from which one might expect further dimensions of language to emerge. We return to an idea I brought up in the introduction, and which I borrowed from Rodolfo Llinás (2002): linguistic language is part of a larger category that includes motor languages. In other words, speech and words are only one fraction of the entire production of language generated by the human brain, and which includes motor languages.&quot;[Sutil, Nicolás Salazar *Motion and Representation: The Language of Human Movement*. The MIT Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Today, architecture is being reduced to the practice of “building images. ”60 In a society saturated by images, the aesthetic practice of architecture has increasingly become “photogenic. ” Against this, it should rather become “photographic,” in the sense I elaborated above. From the misguided idea of architecture as “Sign” in its different variations in the 1970s, the discourse of building has merely moved towards another version as “ image-making,” or “hyperbuilding,” conceived as a form of “media. ” The resulting anaestheticization is the consequence of a failure to “reimagine the aesthetic” of building within the paradigm of the new technology.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;And there is another point. When we use&#x27; artificial languages (or natural and poetic languages as artificial languages, for instance if we transmit a novel by Tolstoy by a brief annotation of the plot), we are isolating meaning from language. Under the complex operations of meaning-generation language is inseparable from the content it expresses. In this last instance we are concerned not merely with a message in a language, but also a message about language, a message in &#x27;which the interest is shifted on to its language.&quot;[Lotman, Yuri M. *Universe of the mind: a semiotic theory of culture*. London: Tauris, 1990.]</li>
<li>&quot;I am using the hypothesis of the dead language only as a telltale sign. It draws attention to a situation in which a context cannot be saturated so as to permit the determination and identification of a sense. Now in this respect a so-called living language is structurally in the same situation. If there are two conditions for fixing the meaning or overcoming the polysemy of a word—namely, the existence of an invariant beneath the diversity of semantic transformations, on the one hand, and the possibility of determining a saturable context, on the other—these two conditions seem to me in any case as problematical for a living language as for a dead one.&quot;[Derrida, Jacques *Psyche: Inventions of the Other, Volume I (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)*. Stanford University Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;What it means depends entirely on how that particular set of letters or sounds (h-o-m-e) functions in the system of language distinct from the functioning of other sets of letters or sounds. ‘Post-structuralism’ is presented as an argument that pushes this insight one step further. It argues that, for example, since a word in a language can only be explained in relation to other words, and so on, all methods of interpreting a text that aim to pin it to some stable reference in the real world or to an author’s meaning are doomed, that the critic is imprisoned in the unstable play of language.&quot;[Clark, Timothy *Martin Heidegger (Routledge Critical Thinkers)*. 2nd. Routledge, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Furthermore, arguing from modularity among other reasons, most authors agree on using two more or less independent components for this purpose. If one accepts a design with two independent components, the quest ion arises how to design the interface between the components, in particular how the dd&#x27;e. IIlM6r,. of the strategie component are ~icatedto the sentence generator. People familiar with work done in natural language understanding would probably expect language based on. logic is a natural candidate for this purpose.&quot;[(auth.), Robert Trappt, Claus-Rainer Rollinger, and Werner Horn (eds.) *GWAI-86 und 2. Österreichische Artificial-Intelligence-Tagung: Ottenstein/Niederösterreich, September 22–26, 1986*. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1986.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is not used solely to build an argument or rationalize form but to disturb our process of design and expose unique social, environmental, and cultural issues embedded in the initial constraints of each project. As a design evolves, we renegotiate its conceptual framework through a process that is inherently fluid, adaptive, and self-critical. We use research to undermine many assumptions about architecture as a discipline, such as the fixity of building type, the hierarchy of facade and entry, the rigid nature of program, and the universal and global character that modern architecture has put into place.&quot;[James, Vincent, and Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;One could reiterate Meyer’s reflections on the relationship between the roof and the enclosure and argue for the importance of construction for the present architecture. This discussion also entails the specificity of the conversion of matter into form; although mediatic techniques have opened a different perceptual field, architectural form is still realized through techniques that can transform historical style into constructive style. Here I would like to draw two conclusions from my excursion into Benjamin’s notes on construction.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Von Neumann’s book finishes with the following insight: “when we talk mathematics, we may be discussing a secondary language, built on the primary language used by the central nervous system” (1958, 82). In other words, mathematics is a symbolic layer of representation that builds on the natural language of the brain. Language is an accident resulting from our encoded brain. 190 e-Motional performance This brief historical analysis leads into the contemporary digital era, in which the exploitation of electrical voltages, physical movement, and code have been extensively integrated within various practices involving electronic motion control.&quot;[Sutil, Nicolás Salazar *Motion and Representation: The Language of Human Movement*. The MIT Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;This is true even though grammarians recognize that nouns can often be used as verbs, and verbs as nouns. They cheerfully call this ‘functional shift’, often without explicitly recognizing that whether a given word is a noun, a verb, an adjective or an adverb depends on its placement in that string of words we call a sentence. Any word can function as any part of speech, as though any chessman could be knight, bishop, queen, by turns. Derrida overturns the everyday concept of games. That concept has been crucial among linguists in expressing the notion that writing is a subsidiary game within language: ‘Here one must think of writing as a game [le jeu] within language’ (OG 50; DG 73).&quot;[Gaston, Sean, and Ian MacLachlan (editors) *Reading Derrida&#x27;s Of Grammatology*. Continuum, 2011.]</li>
