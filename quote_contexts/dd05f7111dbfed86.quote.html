    <pre>2.1 ARCHITECTURE Arrangement includes the putting of things in their proper places and the elegance of effect which is due to adjustments appropriate to the character of the work. Its forms of expression in Greek  are these: groundplan, elevation, and perspective. A groundplan is made by the proper successive use of compasses and rule, through which we get outlines for the plane surfaces of buildings. An elevation is a picture of the front of a building, set upright and properly drawn in the proportions of the contemplated work. Perspective is the method of sketching a front with the sides withdrawing into the background, the lines all meeting in the centre of a circle. All three come of reflexion and invention. Reflexion is careful and laborious thought, and watchful attention directed to the agreeable effect of ones plan. Invention, on the other hand, is the solving of intricate problems and the discovery of new principles by means of brilliancy and versatility. These are the departments belonging under Arrangement. - Vitruvius, The Ten books on architecture In similar fashion to how Vitruvius foregrounded the multidisciplinary nature of Architecture see 1.1, he outlines in a precise way how the process of design operates within a terrain that is inherently multimodal. Crucially he identifies the way in which the different expressions come together through the two operations of reflexion and invention, thus not just identifying them as representations, but instead the domains across which the central actions of arrangement takes place. A later cycle, in a different mode of the same sensibility, is found in the Ten Books of Architecture by Alberti: But I can say this of myself: I have often conceived of projects in the mind that seemed quite commendable at the time; but when I translated them into drawings, I found several errors in the very parts that delighted me most, and quite serious ones; again, when I return to drawings, and measure the dimensions, I recognize and lament my carelessness; finally, when I pass from the drawings to the model, I sometimes notice further mistakes in the individual parts, even over the numbers. For all this I would not expect him to be a Zeuxis in his painting, or a Nichomachus in arithmetic, or an Archimedes in geometry. Let it be enough that he has a grasp of those elements of painting of which we have written; that he has sufficient knowledge of mathematics for the practical and considered application of angles, numbers, and lines, such as that discussed under the topic of weights and the measurements of surfaces and bodies, which some called podismata and embata.- Alberti, On the art of building: in ten books

<em>The architect must be skilled in both the visual and mathematical realms, and possess the ability to reconcile their disparate elements. In the realm of visual expression, the architect must be able to discern the potential of the design to evoke a sense of harmony and balance. Meanwhile, in the realm of mathematics, the architect must be able to apply the principles of geometry and measurement to ensure the structural integrity of the building. The interplay between these two aspects is crucial, as it is through the careful balancing of form and function that the architect is able to create a design that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional.</em></pre>

    <div class="selected">Chapter 7 Visualisation Principles It is an interesting contradiction that although the most important aspect of architectural design is the attractive disposition and massing of three-dimensional solids, an architect develops a design almost entirely from the two-dimensional plans and elevations. Perspectives may be drawn during the sketch design phase, but these will usually be rather rough and poorly detailed.[(Auth.), R. A. Reynolds *Computing for Architects*.

<li>&quot;By combining these two branches of mathematics, Alexander seeks to break a  design problem into its component parts. This process identifies and represents every  design variable in a project and every relationship between these design variables. This allows Alexander to represent the underlying structure of a design problem as  a series of nodes and connections (Fig. 15. 1). The next stage in Alexander’s process  involves using computational analysis to organise the design variables into a treelike  hierarchy to guide the designer on which misfits to address first.&quot;[INPUT: Lee et al. - 2024 - Multimodality in Architecture Collaboration, Technology and Education.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;So too in architectural drawing, light showed up late. And what it  showed up when it arrived was space. It was a great conquest, but it was  neither complete nor sudden; architectural space would remain, one way  or another, limited by and bonded to the pictures that normally gave  access to it.

HORIZON   The perspective projections of the painter and the parallel (orthographic)  projections of the architect both bring space into pictures. 8 The differences between post-Renaissance painting and post-Renaissance architecture are subsumed within this similarity; both arts had conquered the  same territory with similar equipment at much the same time.&quot;[INPUT: Evans - 1995 - The projective cast architecture and its three ge.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;This is because “no one theatre artist works independently to create  a performance” (Malloy 2014, p. 1). Secondly, theatre and operatic design is a type  of multimodal, micro-design problem rare in architecture, but it also directly engages  with similar spatial and representational concerns. Finally, theatre and operatic design  occurs within the confines or limits of a building and negotiating the connections  between the physical architecture and the temporal staging of a production is one  crucial goal of the design team.&quot;[INPUT: Lee et al. - 2024 - Multimodality in Architecture Collaboration, Technology and Education.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Color, typography, imagery, and format are applied within a design layout to create the right sense of balance, tension, proportion, and appeal. This is how design elements form the communicative attributes of the packaging design. Applying design principles to packaging layout can significantly enhance the understanding of what makes one comunicate effectively while another appears unresolved. Balance Balance is the convergence of a design’s elements to create an integrated whole.&quot;[Klimchuk, Marianne R., and Sandra A.

<li>&quot;Figure 7. 9 St Paneras station It is also possible that a building is difficult to describe to the computer not because it is particularly complex, but because of its form. An example of this is the Guggenheim Museum in New York, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. One view of this is shown in Figure 7. 10. It would be very difficult to describe the doubly curved shape of this building and would require a lot of data to be assembled.

<li>&quot;In computer-aided design the optimization strategy plays an important role in accomplishing the last three steps, namely, searching for feasible solutions, comparing alternatives and choosing the optimal solution to be implemented. However, design problems usually involve multiple measures of merit which are to be considered simultaneously in order to judge the performance of the design.&quot;[Sriram, D., and R. Adey *Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Engineering Problems: Proceedings of the 1st International Conference, Southampton University, U.K April 1986*.

<li>&quot;In a different field of design, an architect produces sketches and outlines and discusses these with the client before formalizing a design in the form of a blueprint. Design is rarely a straightforward process and typically involves much iteration and exploration of both requirements (what the system is meant to do and how it should do it) and design solutions. There are many definitions of ‘design’. Most definitions recognize that both problem and solution need to evolve during the design process; rarely can you completely specify something before some design work has been done.&quot;[Benyon, David, Phil Turner, and Susan Turner *Designing Interactive Systems: People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies*. Addison Wesley, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;By holistic, I mean that it sees interaction within a larger frame, often a cultural frame, and recognizes that an interactive artifact must be designed as a part of this larger system. By expressive, I mean that it recognizes the ways in which design and design motifs express systems of values. Design communicates . So a key component of interaction design involves considering the message that the design should communicate and how this relates both to the task at hand and to the details of the design.&quot;[Dourish, Paul *Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction (Bradford Books)*.

Maher Department of Civil Engineering, Carnegie- Mellon University, Pittsburg, PA 15213 1. INTRODUCTION Design is, perhaps, the toughest problem solving activity that engineers perform. Design can be viewed as (Mostow, 1985) constructing an artifact or structure that: 1. satisfies a given functional specification, 2. conforms to the limitations of the resources, and 3. satisfies implicit and explicit design criteria on the form of the artifact.&quot;[Sriram, D., and R.

<li>&quot;Ideas and philosophy from architecture, garden design, interior design, fashion and jewellery design all crop up in various ways and different forms. It is not easy to simply pick up ideas from design disciplines, as much design knowledge is specific to a genre. Designers need to know the materials they work with and it is likely that more specialist design disciplines will emerge.&quot;[Benyon, David, Phil Turner, and Susan Turner *Designing Interactive Systems: People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies*.

<li>&quot;It covers information architecture (Chapter 23) but also includes specifying the interaction design. The key feature here is to establish a clear conceptual model. ■ The ‘skeleton’ plane is concerned with information design, navigation design and interface design. We discuss navigation in some detail in Chapter 25 ■ The final element of Garrett’s scheme is the ‘surface’ plane concerned with the aesthetics of the site and with ensuring that good design guidelines are followed.&quot;[Benyon, David, Phil Turner, and Susan Turner *Designing Interactive Systems: People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies*.
