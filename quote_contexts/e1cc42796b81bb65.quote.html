    <pre>What is assembled in this thesis and its instrument WIPTe is, first of all, an occasion for conversation; an attempt to let multimodal machine learning become discussable from within architectural method, rather than treated as a foreign technical object that architecture merely applies. The contribution

<em>This allows for a reevaluation of the role of data in architectural design, as well as the potential for machine learning to augment and support the design process. By bringing together the theoretical frameworks of architectural method and machine learning, WIPTe offers a unique perspective on the relationship between human and algorithmic agency in design.</em></pre>

    <div class="selected">Their co-presence announces both the site and the project of architectural theory. The way for the interconnection to be established and thus worked through continually cannot be described as though it only had one form. Digital reproducibility within design opens an importunately new domain of activity. Design now has a relationship to the potentially within software programmes. Design now has modelling abilities—abilities that encompass everything from urban topology to the structural capacity and Plus ça change, Plus ça change 29 possibility of space frames—which it had not had hitherto.[Benjamin, Andrew *Writing Art and Architecture*. 2010.]</div>

      <li>&quot;information co-articulate, extending computation from a design tool towards a medium for organising, indexing and communicating architectural discourse. 0 — stairwell, balcony, foyer, elevator, referenced, campaign, escalator This orientation is also present in the chair’s design teaching through Studio Meteora29 invites students to work with custom search instruments and machine-learning–driven libraries as design companions: ask. alice_ch3n8130 to navigate textual corpora, panoramasofcinema31 to traverse filmic space, and search. 0more32 to query three-dimensional models. Rather than treating these platforms as neutral providers of data, the teaching emphasises how architectural projects emerge from learning to question, curate and support architecture through the playing of these instruments.

<li>&quot;Evolutionary design theory in architecture seeks to harness this generative intelligence as the foundation for a new architectural design process. This paper investigates the lineage of evolutionary thought in architectural design, paying particular attention to the current trend towards experimentation with generative algorithmic procedures and the theorization of an evolutionary architecture. Only nature is inspiring and true; only Nature can be support for human works. But do not render Nature, as the landscapists do, showing only the outward aspect.&quot;[(auth.), Robert Kirkbride, and Robert Kirkbride (eds.) *Geometries of Rhetoric*. Birkhäuser Basel, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The MIT Press, 2001. 101 2. 2 AN ARCHITECTONIC VIEW ON DIGITAL MULTIMODALITY [[HMARK-28]] 0 — nightstand, paperweight, collecting, squeezebox, drawer, booklet, chequebook, case Contemporary computational design tools have undoubtedly changed the way in which architects develop projects, both adding precision and coordination to architectural practice. Yet this very structuring power often flattens the epistemic richness that architectural multimodality affords. Systems like Revit and Grasshopper reduce architectural representation to interoperable geometries and quantifiable parameters. As Marinčić1 critiques, architectural computation has historically evolved through simplification within existing models, translating architectural thought into parametric control systems, where design becomes the manipulation of variables. &quot;[INPUT: content_small.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;Within construction planning and execution phases, where the problem or goal is often easier to define clearly, some attempts of system theoretical approaches have been used inspired by the product industry and the applied field of systems engineering. The graph theory-based Design Structure Matrix method (DSM) is one example. 27 However, even if an architectural design problem cannot be put on formula in its entirety, aspects of it can be treated using a systems approach that through a probabilistic connection to the success of the architectural whole could help to qualify choices even in early design phases.&quot;[Vibæk, Kasper Sánchez *Architectural System Structures: Integrating Design Complexity in Industrialised Construction*.

<li>&quot;More specifically, interactive architecture as an emerging design practice simultaneously calls for an architectural approach to interactive systems design, and for an interactive systems design approach to the design of our built environment. As described by Sengers, et al. (2004) the recent movement towards ubiquitous computing calls for such a practical and theoretical bridge between architecture and interactive systems design.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;In philosophy this movement has broadly been termed as posthumanism, framing a large body of work questioning the foundations and centrality of human thoughts and cognitive abilities. The increasing capacity to gather accurate data about the environment and simulate them through more complex algorithms finds here a fertile ground to align philosophical and design agendas to speculate what role random procedures might have in design.&quot;[Bottazzi, Roberto *Digital Architecture Beyond Computers: Fragments of a Cultural History of Computational Design*.

<li>&quot;As Dawkins’ analogy of the blind watchmaker suggests, evolution is a mechanism that proceeds without intentionality, in the absence of a designer. Accordingly, an evolutionary approach to design seems to require a fundamental reconsideration of the architect’s role in the design process. With this question in mind, Manuel Delanda establishes a theoretical groundwork for the application of genetic algorithms to the architectural design process.&quot;[(auth.), Robert Kirkbride, and Robert Kirkbride (eds.) *Geometries of Rhetoric*.

<li>&quot;The paradigmatic shift in the nature of the architectural design process, from that of hand produced drawings to that of CAAD (Computer Aided Architectural Design), has provoked many questions as to how this has affected the way buildings are designed, and the nature of design drawing. It is not simply about the transfer of an established process, or way of working to that of a different medium or technology, but instead the dilemma rests on a more fundamental question as to the role and significance that hand drawing and sketching play in architectural design thinking.&quot;[El-Bizri, Nader *Recto Verso: Redefining the Sketchbook*. New ed. Aldershot: Ashgate Pub. Group, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;The idea of integrated complexity as a means of actively controlling this balance and focusing design attention points towards several new roles of the architect. These will be treated in the following paragraph. The (new) roles of the architect Drawing on design knowledge and design work already embedded in industrialised systems that are delivered as parts of buildings seem to challenge the traditionally perceived role of the architect as the central ‘auteur’ in Findings 219 the architectural design process.&quot;[Vibæk, Kasper Sánchez *Architectural System Structures: Integrating Design Complexity in Industrialised Construction*.

<li>&quot;The use of timebased and code-based software as generative design tools is undermining conventional architectural design methodologies. With each new software upgrade, new techniques flow to the digirati, assuring this technical revolution in architecture has momentum.&quot;[Betsky, Aaron, Ole Bouman, David Deutsch, Elizabeth Diller Ricardo Scofidio, Monika Fleischmann Wolfgang Strauss, Sulan Kolatan William Mac Donald, and William J.

<li>&quot;Illustrations © Achim Menges. 180 The Digital Turn in Architecture 1992–2012 methods, enables the growth of different system types of member organisation, system topology and consequent performative capacity. Such an integral design approach begins to expand the notion of performative polymorphic systems towards digital typogenesis. While the five experiments presented here remain in a proto-architectural state awaiting implementation in a specific architectural context, the related morphogenetic design techniques and technologies allow for the rethinking of the nature of currently established design processes.&quot;[Carpo, Mario *The digital turn in architecture 1990-2010*.

<li>&quot;Moretti was often accused of inconsistency between methods and results: the design of the stadium presented in Milan did not substantially differ from the architectures he had been designing since the 1930s. A more detailed analysis of the process followed would have resolved this apparent contradiction and opened up a useful conversation on the relation between process and outcomes in digitally driven design. The data input in the IBM mainframe did not return a fully fledged three-dimensional model or even a generic spatial design, rather the computer 102﻿Digital Architecture Beyond Computers Figure 4. 2 L.

<li>&quot;For, in this, and many other CITA projects, the aim has not just been instrumental, but has been a critical starting point through which to inform and calibrate an encoding of material dynamics within our design environments. The project demonstrates a design-led probing of the relationship between representation and the represented. The notion of persistent modelling might be understood as a familiar activity to architectural design if considered as describing an active and iterative engagement with design concerns.&quot;[Awan, Nishat, Peter Blundell-Jones, and Mark Meagher *Architecture and movement : the dynamic experience of buildings and landscapes*. London and New York: Routledge, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Thus, equal attention needs to be paid at material-based design and void-based design when focusing on the creation of new architectural textures. If taken together, then these four concepts give us a basic theory, or at least a conceptual framework that describes the primary elements of architecture. In doing so, it provide us with a foundation for analyzing built environments, as well as it functions as a simple guide in the design and realization of new environments.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*.

<li>&quot;Examples include neural network implementations used for the design of mechanical assemblies (Liew and Gero 2004), design optimisation (Peng and Gero 2006) and the exchange of product data between design tools (Kannengiesser and Gero 2007). The majority of this work provides support for re-construction of design concepts at all three levels, comprising function (Fo), behaviour (Bo) and structure (So). 5. Conclusion Designing comprises a rich set of activities that is only beginning to be completely understood.&quot;[Wright, Jaron S., and Lloyd M. Hughes *Computer Animation*. Nova Science, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Many of the initial discussions in the late sixties underlying adaptive and evolutionary models of design and computation have recently resurfaced as contemporary design and production processes have embraced digital design methods. What was primarily discursive in that period has transformed as the information revolution has given rise to new forms of design practice. The work of MRGD developed at the Architectural Association’s Design Research Lab speculates on this potential through playful misuse of Maya hair dynamics and exhaustive examination of the inherent generative spatial organizations as a product of their interplay.&quot;[(auth.) *MORPHE: MRGD*. Springer Vienna, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Alberti rejects linear perspective as an architectural design tool because it is non-Euclidean and therefore untrue to the nature of construction and proportion. Desargues and Poncelet suggest that perspectival projection provides a different version of truth in geometry. I propose that the properties of this truth may stimulate new modes of architectural thinking. In “Architectural Representation beyond Perspectivism,” Alberto PérezGómez and Louise Pelletier criticize the theoretical inquiries of Desargues and the 154 Matters of History descriptive practices of Monge as overly rational modes of projection that deprive the architectural design process of a poetic dimension: The objectifying vision of technology denies the possibility of realizing in one drawing or artifact a symbolic intention that might eventually be present in the built work.&quot;[Forget, Thomas *The Construction of Drawings and Movies: Models for  Architectural Design and Analysis*. Routledge, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;His articles and books distilled a constellation of theories about intelligence and complexity to argue that design had to become process, a “conversation,” in his words, between two intelligent species—human and machine—and not a linear cause-effect interaction. 7 “We are talking about a symbiosis that is a cohabitation of two intelligent species,” he wrote. 8 He was not interested in computerizing design so much as rethinking the design process itself. This symbiosis was necessary to address both a human inability to deal with “large-scale problems”—beyond the protocols of architecture and planning, which were incapable of dealing with systemic problems, emergence, or changing contexts—and simultaneously architects’ and planners’ inability to handle large amounts of specific and local data. 9 Architecture as a machine was about design as a process that could mine data, find patterns, and produce new forms of emergent growth through feedback.&quot;[Halpern, Orit *Beautiful Data: A History of Vision and Reason since 1945*. Durham and London: Duke University Press Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;An open design approach also implies a detailed understanding of how diverse compu -tational methods interact with each other and with analogue methods over the course of the design process. The computational design process offers a means to track and understand the stages in design through tacit and explicit logging of design activity and communication. Figure 4. 6. 1 presents a computer-generated visualization of a design process informed by simulation, which provides insights into the range of design responses to building thermal performance data in a parametric design process. 11 This image, presenting changes to a single script over about 24 hours, illustrates the chronological relationship between simulation feedback, modification to building geometry and modification to parametric definitions, providing a detailed understanding of specific aspects of a design process.&quot;[Awan, Nishat, Peter Blundell-Jones, and Mark Meagher *Architecture and movement : the dynamic experience of buildings and landscapes*.

<li>&quot;The essays in this book suggest a correlation between the early modern invention of architectural design and today’s digital shift, as the latter reverses many of the architectural paradigms that were initiated in the Renaissance. Technologies of Architectural Representation Perspective, Projections and Design presents a selection of essays which discuss various aspects of image-making technologies, geometrical knowledge, and tools for architectural design, from the discovery of new formats for architectural drawing in the Renaissance to contemporary digital technologies for design and manufacturing.&quot;[Carpo, Mario, and Frederique Lemerle-Pauwels *Perspective, Projections and Design: Technologies of Architectural Representation*.

Support for Re-Construction of Design Concepts • Si → Si (process 6), Bi → Bi (process 5) and Fi → Fi (process 4): The idea of generating design concepts by situated re-construction rather than static retrieval from previous experience is quite new in design research. As a result, very little work has been done towards the development of computational models and tools that support this process. However, a number of research demonstrators have shown both the feasibility and the potential benefits of future constructive memory tools.&quot;[Wright, Jaron S., and Lloyd M.

<li>&quot;Indeed, metaphor has not only been an important heuristic tool at different stages of theory formation (Collins 1970; Forty 2000), but also plays an important role in the process of thinking a building, as has been stressed by scholars dealing with architectural design (Lawson and Ming Loke 1997; Casakin and Goldschmidt 1999; Medway and Clark 2003). They have drawn attention to the contribution of metaphor as a first-order design resource, one that is particularly useful in mediating the first, most creative and personal stage of design, as well as the successive reworkings of the preliminary design sketches.&quot;[Caballero, Rosario *Re-Viewing Space: Figurative Language in Architects’ Assessment of Built Space*.
