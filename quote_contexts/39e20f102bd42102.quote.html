    <pre>Following from this we can also contextualise the synergies between the different dimensions, based on how they present themselves through the vocabulary. For example, the five films that align themselves the most in conversation to *Chungking Express* by Wong Kar-wai are in order of likeness:</pre>

      <li>&quot;*It is sometimes the adherence of the perceived object to its context, and, as it were, its viscosity, sometimes the presence in it of a positive indeterminate which prevents the spatial, temporal and numerical wholes from becoming articulated into manageable, distinct and identifiable terms.* [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=39&amp;annotation=WEJ59L3K)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The color is yet a variant in another dimension of vari- ation, that of its relations with the surroundings: this red is what it is only by connecting up from its place with other reds about it, with which it forms a constellation, or with other colors it dominates or that dominate it, that it attracts or that attract it, that it repels or that repel it. I* — **The ability to speak about one dimension through another** [Toadvine and Lawlor - Merleau-Ponty Reader.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3CCSNL9B?page=2&amp;annotation=GZBLRYEY)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Figure 1 is not recalled by Figure 2, or rather it is so recalled only if one has first seen in Figure 2 ‘a possible Figure 1’, which amounts to saying that the actual resemblance does not relieve us of the necessity of asking how it is first made possible by the present organization of Figure 2.* [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=47&amp;annotation=CZAVVS2E)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*An Informational Instrument celebrates these contradictions without having an explicit a priori base unit. It opens a different perspective. What if the emphasis is not on measuring reality but on encoding and decoding it in many ways, by crafting different keys to access the world in many ways? What if it is about articulating faces and mixing libraries? It is a different game then. You are not looking for specific properties to measure, but are trying to develop a communication channel through which you can articulate profiles of different encodings. This is the search for the most general and abstract ingredients in a given situation. There is no base unit of a book. Yet, in a Plentiful Play books are profiling libraries from many perspectives simultaneously. A book becomes a constitutive part of a character of an alphabet that articulates its library—a symbolic void element* — **Interesting to relate to groups, rings, and bodies** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=308&amp;annotation=4WBUS9PP)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*it juxtaposes terms from several languages, as we have said, logic-arithmetical terms (parts, multiplicity, unity, divisibility. . . ), technical terms (automatons, windows. . . ), pneumatic terms (affections, representation, etc. ), natural terms (life, death, animal souls. . . ), etc. , so that by revolving around it, a privileged point of view highlights an arithmetic, geometric scenography. . . and so on.* [02.c. en (gpt) _troisiÃ¨me chapitre_ deuxiÃ¨me partie [Serres, Michael_Le systÃ¨me de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CGEFGZ5G?page=51&amp;annotation=BX7PDCWT)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*We want to know how, by its own vitality, and without carrying complementary material into a mythical unconscious, con- sciousness can, in course of time, modify the structure of its surround- ings; how, at every moment, its former experience is present to it in the form of a horizon which it can reopen—‘if it chooses to take that horizon as a theme of knowledge’—in an act of recollection, but which it can equally leave on the fringe of experience, and which then immediately provides the perceived with a present atmosphere and significance.* [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=50&amp;annotation=THJL8SEM)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*To enable me to find a cat in the puzzle, it is necessary that ‘the meaning-unit “cat” should in some way prescribe those elements of the picture which the coordinating activity is to retain and those which it is to overlook’.* [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=49&amp;annotation=734HWHPL)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*There is a large body of multimodal research that explores the dynamics of the interaction between image and language.* — **Interesting but to me it seems to fall into the same pitfalls where meaning is seen as a singularly defined unifying mapping of the modalities. However this fails to acknowledge that the modalities need to remain in their domain to bear this meaning. This collapsing them and studying them by means of analysing meaning seems odd to me. However further and closer reading is needed.

Primary argument is that our approach is an active one where it navigates domains to put something forward which inherently relies on a different approach where this research is employing an analytical method to study how understanding is derived from multimodal sources . (Analysis vs Algebra?)** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=275&amp;annotation=7RJ5TVJQ)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&amp;annotation=WA8NIH6S)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The unity of the object is based on the foreshadowing of an imminent order which is about to spring upon us a reply to questions merely latent in the landscape.* [Merleau-Ponty - 2002 - Phenomenology of perception an introduction.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L85BKQYP?page=45&amp;annotation=JDDDEVRS)&quot;</li>
