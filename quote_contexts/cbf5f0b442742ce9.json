Yet planners often have a strong inclination to get so involved in the space planning process and its two-dimensional, jigsaw-puzzle-like qualities that the resulting three-dimensional qualities of the space become an afterthought.", "suggested_query": "By introducing subtle changes in level, texture, and color, it is possible to create a sense of depth and visual interest within a room. For instance, a raised platform or a lowered floor can create a sense of intimacy or separation, while a change in floor texture or color can define different areas or zones within the space.  As the eye travels across the floor, it can be led on a journey through the room, guided by the subtle variations in plane and elevation.  In this way, the floor can become a dynamic and engaging element, rather than simply a static surface.  By acknowledging the floor as an active design element, it is possible to create a sense of harmony and balance within the space.  Ultimately, the floor can become a key component in the design of a room, working in tandem with the walls to create a sense of cohesion and visual flow.  With careful consideration, the floor can become a true masterpiece of design, elevating the entire space to new heights.  And yet, the humble floor remains often overlooked, and its true potential is left untapped.  It is time to give this often neglected element the recognition it deserves.", "suggest_context": ". . the floor. Thats right. The floor.
