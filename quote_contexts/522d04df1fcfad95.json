This selection process involves manual curation of the films, as well as the use of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between the films. The resulting dataset is then used to train a language model that can generate text based on the correlation between the modalities. In this way, the model is able to capture the nuances of the films and generate text that is both accurate and meaningful.  The model is further refined by the inclusion of additional data sources, such as film scripts and critical reviews, which provide further insight into the semantic meaning of the films. The model is then used to generate a thesis that is both well-supported and well-reasoned.  This chapter will describe the construction of the model in more detail, as well as the limitations and potential biases of the model.  In the following chapter, the model will be used to generate a thesis that is both well-supported and well-reasoned.
