    <pre>Although ornamentation might have gone out of fashion a bit in the modern &quot;stile&quot;, we also have to admit that people still love decoration, most notably the most intimate surface of a person is more and more subject to decoration: the skin.

<em>From tattoos to permanent makeup, we have seen a significant rise in people using their bodies as a canvas for self-expression and personal style.</em></pre>

    <div class="selected">The skinned body is less a body even than a skeleton, which we find it easier to reclothe in flesh (there are plenty of dancing skeletons in story and ritual, but very few skinned bodies). The skin always takes the body with it. The skin is, so to speak, the body’s face, the face of its bodiliness. The skinned body is formless, faceless, its face having been taken off with its skin. Where a leg, or a liver or a heart remain what they are once removed from the body and may be imagined as continuing to function apart from the body which has formed them, the skin itself is no longer a skin once it is detached.[Connor, Steven *The Book of Skin*. 2009.]</div>

      <li>&quot;The skinned body is less a body even than a skeleton, which we find it easier to reclothe in flesh (there are plenty of dancing skeletons in story and ritual, but very few skinned bodies).

<li>&quot;While most people are accustomed to seeing animal hair as a neutral medium in a piece of art, the use of actual human hair becomes an integral part of the artistic meaning. Unlike paper, wood, paint, clay, stone, bronze, metals, and plastics, human hair comes from a living, thinking, laughing, crying human body, and so its use as a material raises the immediate question: Who gave the hair and why?Hair artist Cassandra Holden8 asserts that “people are often uncomfortable seeing hair that is unattached to a human body because of its intense personal nature. ” There are many different applications for hair in art. 9 One of the most basic uses is demonstrated by artist Althea Murphy-Price, who sculpts free hair into shapes.&quot;[Stenn, Kurt *Hair : a human history*.

<li>&quot;Age-tagging is therefore widely used as a means of unambiguously allocating people to particular age groups. In her discussion of age-tagging, Mellencamp contrasts the classical body, which she defines as “monumental, static, closed, sleek and quiet” against another type of body: the grotesque, carnivalesque body (Mellencamp (1992, p. 279).&quot;[(auth.), Elisabeth Schwaiger *Ageing, Gender, Embodiment and Dance: Finding a Balance*.

<li>&quot;For Spillers, this violent writing on the body reads like a tattoo: 120 SECOND SKIN These undecipherable markings on the captive body render a kind of hieroglyphics of the ﬂesh whose severe disjunctions come to be hidden to the cultural seeing by skin color.&quot;[Cheng, Anne Anlin *Second Skin: Josephine Baker &amp; the Modern Surface*.

<li>&quot;Where the American cartoon essentially makes the body, plastic, arbitrary and a space for physical play, and Eastern European animation uses the body to engage with political reality (social role, labor, psychosomatic identity), animation in an English setting focuses the body as a site of self-consciousness and cultural judgment. This becomes the subject of Quinn’s Body Beautiful (1988), which sees Beryl pestered by sexist factory lothario, Vince, and teased and criticized by her female workmates concerning her weight.&quot;[Horton, Andrew, and Joanna E. Rapf (eds.) *A Companion to Film Comedy*. Wiley-Blackwell, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;190 Appendix Another way in which gender has been marked is in the control of the body. Bodily self-control, the ability to control the body’s comportment, movements and emissions, has been an important concept in defining social status in Western cultures. For example, anthropologist Mary Douglas in her book Natural Symbols linked the notion of two bodies – the social body and the physical body – to bodily control.&quot;[(auth.), Elisabeth Schwaiger *Ageing, Gender, Embodiment and Dance: Finding a Balance*. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Within the framework of the carnivalesque, liberation of the unruly body takes on a positive force of renewal that has ‘‘a cosmic and at the 90 Frank Krutnik same time an all-people’s character. ’’ As Bakhtin (1984: 19) sees it, there is a fundamental synergy between this ﬁguration of the body and the broader social utopianism of the carnivalesque, as the ‘‘material bodily principle is contained not in the biological individual, not in the bourgeois ego, but in the people, a people who are continually growing and renewed.&quot;[Horton, Andrew, and Joanna E. Rapf (eds.) *A Companion to Film Comedy*. Wiley-Blackwell, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Seen from the trout&#x27;s point of view, the precise body color and translucency is apparent. But the dead opacity of most body materials defeats any attempts at proper color and translucency. After Foster, the quest for the perfect body expanded. Even so-called imitationistssuch as Halford-wished, within the confine of their chosen materials and methods, to imitate only a few features of the insect&#x27;s body-color and size.

<li>&quot;Briefly, The Significance of the Physical Constitution in Mental Disease suggested, following the work of Meyer and Emile Kraepelin, that while individual persons are unique, people themselves are classifiable with regard to habitus (body form), inner organs, and psychobiology. In his study of sixty-five randomly chosen men from the Phipps Clinic, Wertham, following Kretschmer’s typologies, identified four morphological body types.&quot;[Beaty, Bart *Fredric Wertham and the Critique of Mass Culture*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Physical prowess, risk-taking, and a “hard-core” image (e. g. , irreverent and hedonistic lifestyle, antiauthoritarian, hyperheterosexuality, pranks, and high jinks) were all important aspects of the “core” snowboarding identity embodied by many early boarders, and endorsed by the niche media. Many young committed participants embraced a reckless, short-term approach to the body. For example, professional snowboarder Scotty Wittlake sarcastically described his relationship to his body: “My body’s a temple, so only the finest fast foods enter it.&quot;[Thorpe, Holly *Snowboarding: The Ultimate Guide*. Greenwood, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;In Iran, for example, during the height of “modernization” in the 1970s, very limited preoccupation with the most basic issues related to the female body and its representation led to a sociopolitical backlash. 49 The female body never freed itself from politics (and traditional constraints).&quot;[Talattof, Kamran *Modernity, Sexuality, and Ideology in Iran: The Life and Legacy of a Popular Female Artist*.

<li>&quot;Palermo, Palermo – Julie Shanahan This other kind of language is rooted in the body. Whilst in Endicott’s Walzer solo the body’s corporeality is foregrounded, we are graphically shown what the body can and cannot do. We are also shown the body’s materiality.&quot;[Briginshaw, Valerie A., and Ramsay Burt *Writing Dancing Together*. Palgrave Macmillan, 2009.]</li>

<li>&quot;The experience of unity, co-ordination and a single identity that body-image engenders in turn forms the basis for the undertaking of (meaningful) voluntary The ‘libidinal’ body 99 action in the world. All forms of willful action, Schilder suggests, necessarily involve the co-ordination of this underlying bodily schema: In this plan [of action] the knowledge of one’s own body is an absolute necessity. There must always be a knowledge that I am acting with my body, that I have to use a particular part of my body.&quot;[Bendelow, Gillia *The &#x27;Lived&#x27; Body: Sociological Themes, Embodied Issues*. 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;Theoretical approaches insist that the body functions as the “preeminent object” of culture. 2 Although the body as a “socially constructed artefact” is no longer seen as “natural,” Bryan S. Turner urges us not to “ignore the physiological, biological, and chemical grounding of the body. ”3 His caution is based on the sense that the recent attention to the body is impatient with the material body, rendering it “dematerialized by feminist, linguistic, and psychoanalytic theory. ”4 This study investigates how late medieval England dealt with excrement, both materially and figuratively, and asserts that the lowest of matters— excrement—matters.&quot;[Morrison, Susan Signe *Excrement in the Late Middle Ages: Sacred Filth and Chaucer&#x27;s Fecopoetics (The New Middle Ages)*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Until recently, however, sociologists have tended to neglect the role of physical education lessons in these vital processes. As Kirk and Tinning (1994) argue, in physical education classes, physical culture is instantiated in a most immediate, visible and visceral fashion. More precisely, engagement with physical tasks in physical education, itself a key site of health promotion, exposes the adolescent body and thus 22 Sociology and the ‘problem’ of the body places self-identity at risk. As a consequence, many young people, particularly girls, experience varying degrees of estrangement or disembodiment both in their physical education lessons and other encounters with popular physical culture as a strategy for protecting or defending their self-identities.&quot;[Bendelow, Gillia *The &#x27;Lived&#x27; Body: Sociological Themes, Embodied Issues*. 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;Because they cannot afford private physicians, many poor people end their days in large urban teaching hospitals, where they are studied in sickness and in death by medical students and interns. But the socioeconomically disadvantaged generally die in ways different from those of wealthier people, ways that can alter the size and appearance of their internal organs. As a result anatomists and medical students, working with this limited and biased range of material, have acquired a skewed notion of what a “normal” human body looks like.&quot;[Sapolsky, Robert M. *The Trouble With Testosterone: And Other Essays on the Biology of the Human Predi*. Scribner, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;Take Ping-Pong, for example. The call and recall of the players’ actions can really make for some interesting tandem action. Billiards is a game that combines slow action and very focused concentration. Meanwhile, card games provide little or no action, but offer a lot of concentration from your subject’s facial expressions and body language. In this chapter, we’ve explored how to analyze body language and action when there are multiple subjects or props involved. Group dynamics are for the advanced quick sketcher, but it’s good practice to attempt to capture multiple subjects—analyzing body type and body language of many people—in your quick sketching.&quot;[Husband, Ron *Quick sketching with Ron Husband*. 2nd ed. CRC Press, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;Garments and accessories are distinctly different in material form and character from other objects of material culture, in that objects of dress bear some relationship to the body that wore them. Typically made of cloth, a garment can serve to protect, adorn, mark or obscure the body. The fact that dress is worn on the body also means that the actions of the body become imbued in the cloth, especially at points of contact with body parts that move, such as the elbows, the knees, or parts that sweat.&quot;[Mida, Ingrid, and Alexandra Kim *The Dress Detective: A Practical Guide to Object-Based Research in Fashion*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Both of these factors contribute to making larger, healthier girls, a process that was already in motion by 1900. American girls today are appreciably larger than they were eighty or even thirty years ago. Size is important because a young woman must have a certain level of stored, easily metabolized energy in the form of body fat in order to start menstruation, and she also needs to attain a certain degree of skeletal growth, especially in pelvic size. 3 Although most people think of the biology of the human body as relatively static from one generation to the next, the young female body has in fact changed over time.&quot;[Brumberg, Joan Jacobs *The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls*.

<li>&quot;To give one’s heart was a potent metaphor for sexual activity. This body language reflects the emotional nature that was assigned the body and its constituents. Rather than residing in the mental sphere, the Egyptian emotional world was rooted in the very matter of the individual body.&quot;[Joyce, Rosemary A., Lynn M. Meskell, and Bryan S. Turner *Embodied Lives:: Figuring Ancient Maya and Egyptian Experience*. Routledge, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Arlie Russell Hochschild called this process &quot;emotion work&quot; (1979; 1983, 49). Consciously or unconsciously, people try to feel and show what they consider proper emotions for people of their gender, age, social class, and ethnic group. At times, people follow sympathy rules rather cynically, engaging in &quot;surface acting. &quot;One listens with half an ear to a neighbor&#x27;s sad tale or sends a sympathy card to a co-worker for appearance&#x27; sake. At other times, people engage in &quot;deep acting,&quot; synchronizing their feelings with the social norms.&quot;[Clark, Candace *Misery and company: sympathy in everyday life*. University of Chicago Press, 1997.]</li>
