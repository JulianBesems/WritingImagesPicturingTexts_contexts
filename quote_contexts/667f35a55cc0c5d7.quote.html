      <li>&quot;Reading in my hut one autumn evening, the sudden sound of a pomegranate cracking open riveted my attention. One night when I went out to drink water from the garden tap, I heard a long-haul truck barreling along a distant freeway, and another time, as steam rose around my dishwater, I felt the floor rumble with a passing train.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;These moments of immediacy made me shiver.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>

Hardcover. Axel Menges, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Various means were employed to animate water, such as fountains and erupting springs. The aim was to achieve the maximum sensational, audible and visual pleasure of water while using the least possible amount of water and often its recycling.&quot;[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;One of the small pools (G on the plan) is usually empty. You step into the water and realise why; the water is icy. No one stays in there very long. The other pools are warm.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Perhaps “unused” is a better word for what we’re interested in. Certainly “ruined” describes many of them fairly well, although some are remarkably sound and could be made serviceable again without too much effort.&quot;[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America&#x27;s Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Roof scupper An opening in a wall or parapet that allows water to drain from a roof. Roofing felt Originally made with cotton rag content, this asphalt-saturated product is now made of paper.&quot;[Ernest., Burden *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;As a liquid material, water is formless and ﬂowing; as a concept, we value its transparency, purity and clarity. Gaston Bachelard writes about the poetic qualities of water (1983: 126–30, 159–85).&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;The pressure of a surge of water on poor or badly formed outlet pipes can press on the outlet pipe, allowing water to leak at the junction of the pipe and gutter.&quot;[*Roofs: A Guide to the Repair of Historic Roofs* Stationery Office, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Fearless of failure, he designed bridges that collapsed, fortifications that were breached. Eventually failure made theory and theory made experts—today’s engineers.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>

Hardcover. Axel Menges, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Thus drinking water can take on the taste of foreign elements present in groundwater aquifers, such as mineral salts and industry contaminates. “Hard” water has picked up calcium and magnesium; “soft” water is rainwater or groundwater that has seeped through granite deposits. Non-colloidal water combines with other elements in an impermanent state.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;From the pronouncements made by the master of ceremonies to the extraordinary version of “Crying,” this is a venue that speaks Spanish.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Luis Barragan’s water gardens and Tadao Ando’s Church of Water are worth it. Metaphors of liquidity allow Bachelard to link water and dreams. Dreams occur in a pre-conscience, ﬂuid state.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;‘At the end of filming, everything we’d made would be thrown in the skip which I thought was a huge waste. However, during that time I learnt how to fabricate anything, in almost any material and finish.&quot;[*Reclaim Magzine* 2017.]</li>
