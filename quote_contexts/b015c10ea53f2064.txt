Selected: Whether you are going up or going down, a staircase takes you to another level and to somewhere new, so it is important that its design should both reflect and generate a sense of anticipation and excitement. Here, an elegant curved staircase of moulded dark-stained timber and glass panels seems to flow through this London townhouse. The lighter wood treads and risers are covered with a runner of taupe wool carpet, edged with a darker shade of taupe for definition.[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]

01. "When a sample is placed against a power grinder, cast iron gives ragged reddish sparks, wrought iron narrow white sparks, and steel gives straw-coloured sparks with stars. Construction Individual flights of a metal staircase resemble bridge spans in that they were usually designed to be supported only at their ends. All three traditional forms of iron were used in the construction of staircases for both structural and decorative purposes, but have very different properties, as set out above."[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*. Routledge, 2014.]

Jacqui Small, 2016.]

03. "We designed the French-style staircase and had it made in wrought iron, with a taupe wood handrail and steps to match the herringbone floorboards. The effect is softened by the circles incorporated into the design of the metal balusters, the luxe silk carpet and the ’waterfall’ of crystal teardrop lights by OCHRE, cascading down the wall to the entrance hall below."[Hoppen, Kelly *House of Hoppen: A Retrospective*. Jacqui Small, 2016.]

04. "Palladlan stairs are  always enclosed by  walls; visual cross-  connections are unthinkable. A spatial construct  created by stairs, the  creation of a stairwell,  was only achieved In  stairs winding around  large openings, stair  'eyes'. Palladio used Roman  stairs for his winding ^  stair, such as Bramantes  creation In the Vatican (1507-1514) and possibly also Raffael s  design for the Villa  Madama. " "[INPUT: stair.pdf]

05. "Cantilevered stairs have been described in the previous chapters. They provide an excellent example of the variety of ways that engineers become involved, whether the stairs are traditional in form and materials, or are modern feature stairs built in new materials. The way these stairs ‘work’ structurally has been the subject of much debate between engineers for many years."[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*. Routledge, 2014.]

06. "It is only in modern times and the  1 0 th century that the opening created  by the enclosing stairs, has become  a tool for design. Its outline follows  contemporary and fashionable forms  °f ornamentation. blot only the stairs with its sequence  °f steps, and its balustrades, but also  the 'eye' of the stair received a new  Modern take. Master builders of winding stairs built before the baroque  were not yet ready to address the 'eye'  of the stairs in design terms. "[INPUT: stair.pdf]

08. "How dull, in contrast, are intact stairs who stand with ease, paying no attention to the perfect state of their matter. Such stairs rise despite their steps. The function transcends the material. The material is instrumental to an overriding activity that pursues its goal without noticeable difficulty. A flight of stairs is but of fleeting interest, unless it is a new and remarkable form."[Ginsberg, Robert *The Aesthetics of Ruins: Illustrated by the Author*. Rodopi, 2004.]

10. "This type of construction takes a bit more expertise and time, but it pays big rewards in a graceful appearance far beyond what you would expect on such a modest deck. In fact, the scalloped edge is what brings this deck to life, and the stairs are a big part of that flair. The best deck stairs integrate with the design so that the eye doesn’t even necessarily read the steps as steps."[Peterson, Chris *Deck ideas you can use: creative deck designs for every home & yard*. Minneapolis, Minn: Creative Publishing international, 2011.]

11. "The technique used here is a common one on upscale contemporary decks. The steps are built to entirely surround the perimeter of the deck, looking almost like layers or edging. A border of decorative stone adds to the effect and provides a pretty transition between the deck steps and the grass. The first consideration in designing stairs is safety. But there really is no need to sacrifice style to have safe steps."[Peterson, Chris *Deck ideas you can use: creative deck designs for every home & yard*. Minneapolis, Minn: Creative Publishing international, 2011.]

12. "In the Arts and Crafts style craftsmanship is key. The continuous horizontal wood grain across the entire cherry base·unit drawers produces a dramatic design that proudly displays the piece's high. quality workmanship. The ribbed glass panels on these custom cabinet doors lighten the look of a bank of cabinetry yet obscure the practical (as opposed to ornamental) contents within."[Labau, Peter *The New Bungalow Kitchen*. Taunton Press, 2007.]

13. "In principle, the floor is laid with tatami of fragrant, light green rush; walls are made of paper (when, for example, shoji are used), wood, or natural-colored clay; and the ceiling constructed of wood or bamboo. Colors tend to be white or light brown; materials are organic; and texture, matt as opposed to gloss. It is generally held that materials should be deployed in as natural a manner as possible."[Yagi, Koji *A Japanese Touch for Your Home*. Tokyo; New York :, New York: Kodansha International; Distributed by Kodansha International/USA through Harper & Row, 1992.]

14. "One such development was the use of tubular steel to frame and support chairs, tables, and sofas. Produced by machine, steel tubing could be bent and shaped to form simple, elegant frames that required little hand-finishing and upholstery. The German architect Marcel Breuer, a Bauhaus instructor, introduced tubular steel in his light, graceful, and comfortable Wassily chair of 1925."[Н.М., Філіппова, and Смуглякова М.К. *Focus on Design.

15. "RIGHT This is the perfect example of how a strong colour can be used in one space to make another space adjacent to it feel lighter and bigger. The diminutive staircase appears much larger than it actually is because the walls of the hall leading to it are painted in a dark ‘Inchrya Blue’. ‘Hardwick White’ on the stairs themselves and ‘Pointing’ on the staircase walls serve to create an even greater sense of light and space."[Studholme, Joa, and Charlotte Cosby *Farrow & Ball How to Decorate: Transform Your Home with Paint & Paper*.

18. "Fortunately, Japan is blessed with good raw materials, particularly timber, well suited to the climate and ideal for an earthquake-prone country. The abundance and variety of wood has, as a result, instilled in the Japanese a keen appreciation of wood—its luster, fragrance, and texture. As will be seen in this book, wood, paper, and other native materials are copiously used in the home."[Yagi, Koji *A Japanese Touch for Your Home*.

19. "No doubt scientific and technological advances during the twentieth century contributed to the scope of materials available to the mazemakers, who still sometimes combine traditional and modern techniques, and, more often than not, move in totally new and radical directions. The materials seem to have no bounds, from rock, soil, stone, pebbles, sand, boxwood, hornbeam, bricks, wood, water, frozen lakes, tiles, and mirrors to maize, plastic mats and tiles, concrete, cellophane, broom bristles, bamboo, floor tiles, straw bales, straws, string, shells, rope, nylon thread, beads, bottle caps, stainless steel, polycarbonate, aluminum, glass, bronze, plywood, baled hay, bamboo, wire cages, marble, chain-link fencing, inflatables, iron, magnets, coal, cardboard boxes, canvas, chalk, snow, ice, sea salt, felt, Lego bricks, modeling clay, Masonite, phosphorescent paint, laser beams, projected light, color, food cans, used tires, fallen leaves, books, resin, and thermo-plastics."[Bounford, Julie E *The Curious History of Mazes: 4,000 Years of Fascinating Twists and Turns: With Over 100 Intriguing Puzzles to Solve*.

20. "Weiss used two coats of durable wood floor paint on her workbenches to help them withstand the heavy use of a potting shed. (Top) An L-shaped workbench provides workspace for serious potting pursuits. Shelves were built below the bench to store pots and tools. Large windows on all sides let in plenty of light. The couple also found free salvaged wood, which they used to build the benches."[Kotite, Erika *She sheds : a room of your own*. Cool Springs Press, 2017.]

21. "1985; Shields et al. 2009) times were given on a per floor basis. However most of the authors instead calculated speed based on a measured distance within the stairs. When descending stairs in a high-rise building, travel distance in stairs needs to include both travel on landings and treads. The differences in the studies regarding travel distance stemmed from which components were included and, if included, how the travel distance was calculated."[Hoskins, Bryan L., and James A. Milke (auth.) *Study of Movement Speeds Down Stairs*. Springer-Verlag New York, 2013.]

22. "The design, which required twelve stencils, nine colors of japan paint, and two weeks of labor to complete, was adapted from a scrap offabric. Designed and stenciled by Anne Rullman and Lynn An is Terrel. elegant coffered ceiling transformed into a series of skylights that open to a perpetual nighttime sky. The recessed panels were painted with a midnight blue latex paint, then an even darker blue glaze was sponged on surface to give the movement and depth."[Gauss, Jane *Stenciling techniques : a complete guide to traditional and contemporary designs for the home*. New York: Watson-Guptill Publications, 1995.]

23. "Robert Adam (1728–1792) and his brother James, along with Sir William Chambers (1723–1796) and others made cantilevered stone staircases a very fashionable accessory. Stone treads required the use of wrought-iron balusters, and the ability to bend and flatten the iron into any shape made the material an ideal one for architectural design. There was also a use for wrought iron in the geometrical stairs as they were usually fitted with thin one-inch square section softwood balusters that gave little strength to the structure; thus every six treads or so an iron baluster was added."[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*. Routledge, 2014.]
