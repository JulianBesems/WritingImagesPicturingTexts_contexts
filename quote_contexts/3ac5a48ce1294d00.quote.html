Computers run by relying upon zeros and ones, ons and offs, hard drives gridded out in block parcels, software constructed in distinct hierarchies.

<li>&quot;Donald Norman (2002), in his writings on user-centric interface design, insists that makers of objects and of virtual worlds create a conceptual model that users can understand—models that become a part of the user’s intuitive knowledge as much as gravity or the properties of water. Designers work to provide “intuitive exchanges” with | | 305 | Mary Flanagan | | 306 | | Figure 15. 2 | Traditional interface systems—any type of system that requires interaction.

<li>&quot;Even just writing a phone number down on a Post-it Note requires some physical connection. The physical means something. People like it. Even when moving to the digital world, people feel reassured by the physical. Skeuomorphic design – the replication of an object’s physical characteristics in another material or form – has long been used by software designers so that users will immediately understand how to interact with new interfaces. Visual metaphors, such as the magnifying glass meaning ‘search’ or the nuts and bolts meaning ‘settings’, are easy to understand.&quot;[Ward, James *Adventures in Stationery: A Journey Through Your Pencil Case*.

<li>&quot;Using the metaphor of the machine, and the analogy of the scientific method, the modernists purported to eliminate the sentimental and the irrational from their work. They tried to make design as objective a process as possible. They created a language for design characterized by simplified forms and smooth surfaces that seemed to suggest mechanical production. The rhetorical message carried by design became as important as its substance. As a propagandist Le Corbusier had the brilliant insight to describe the house as a machine for living in.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*.

<li>&quot;Each new type face is heralded as an &quot;original design. &quot;At once arises the query, What is an original type design?I should like at this point to outline here the conclusions I have formed after many years devoted to the study and practice of type designing. I feel that the ability to carry out personally every detail of drawing, pattern making, matrix engraving, the com, position, too, of the completed types, the designing of more than one hundred type faces, and the writing of many articles THE DESIGN OF TYPES 67] on the subject, qualifies me, or at least encourages me, to pre. . , sent those conclusions, asking only from all men pity, and of the angels, power.&quot;[Goudy, Frederic W. *Typologia: Studies in Type Design and Type Making*.

<li>&quot;However, with Jonathan Ive replacing Steve Forstall as head of Apple’s Human Interface team, the reliance on real-world design elements was scaled back for the release of iOS 7 in 2013. Microsoft’s Metro design language, used for Windows 8 and Windows Phone, appears to have been a deliberate attempt to differentiate itself from the skeuomorphic design over-used by Apple, focusing instead on typography and clean, flat design which is ‘authentically digital’. With skeuomorphic elements gradually being replaced by simpler, flatter designs on our tablets and smartphones, what could actually result is a greater appreciation of the physical (the real physical, not just the digital with a leather texture applied over the top).&quot;[Ward, James *Adventures in Stationery: A Journey Through Your Pencil Case*.

<li>&quot;They believed that giving efficient form to information required more than just pictorial illustration (“Ease of seeing means more than easy to look at,” wrote K. Holm). Their crystalline charts became the foundation on which comprehension could be built. In fact, in one simple chart the whole of Designing Information is efficiently summarized: “Transmitting: speed, accessibility; Seeing: visual selectivity, visual continuity; Comprehending: visual extension, universality. ” This synthesis was the basis of their last collaborative book, Catalog Design Progress, a spiral-bound volume with a horizontal format that, incidentally, became the design standard for industrial design manuals (and arguably a model for later corporate graphic standards manuals).&quot;[Heller, Steven *The Graphic Design Reader*. Allworth Press, 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;What had deterred artists from drawing images directly on celluloid was the jittery effect caused by the slight differences between one frame and the next. It took a special kind of artist to regard this jitter as an advantage, as a display of energy, and as a visual equivalent of musical resonance. Animators of all kinds from Walt Disney to the German abstract artists had sought smooth movement and maximum control. Similarly, the long tradition of tinting ﬁlm and adding hand-painted areas of colour (by both brush 165 166 len lye and stencil) had emphasised neatness and precision.&quot;[Horrocks, Roger *Len Lye: A Biography*. Auckland University Press, 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;As Caroline Blinder demonstrates in her analysis of the ways in which Miller learnt from André Breton’s use of Brassaï’s photographs in Nadja (1924), proposing his own image-text disjunction when using Brassaï’s images for the first edition of Quiet Days in Clichy, Miller’s conceptualization of image and text was very much—as the inscription to the copy of Into the Night Life that I saw suggests—a “duet. ” Miller wanted “the image to become an end in itself, an autonomous creation,” Brassaï, writes, so that, in Blinder’s words, the images “could be both an extension of the artist’s vision and an independent creation. ”12 Schatz’s illustrations and graphic design create something other than Miller’s original.&quot;[Decker, James M., Indrek Manniste, and Louis A. Renza *Henry Miller: New Perspectives*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Using the language of film here may be anachronistic, but it is irresistible because the designer of Trajan’s Column was anticipating certain film techniques familiar to studio directors. Trees, for example, appear not just as elements of landscape, but serve to divide distinct scenes, as today a director would use a visual cut. The frieze also makes adroit use of multiple viewpoints, especially the aerial perspective or bird’s-eye view, to heighten the drama of battle, and also to give extra narrative information.&quot;[Spivey, Nigel *How Art Made the World: A Journey to the Origins of Human Creativity*.

<li>&quot;It was a technique that took an effort to unlearn when I finally took to a laptop. With the Lexikon, touch one of its keys, no matter how gently, and it took off with startling speed, as if trying to escape, in a sudden detonation of energy. Whether from a defect in the design, or shortcomings in the quality-control standards in Glasgow, after ten minutes of continuous use the Lexikon became incapable of delivering a straight line of type.&quot;[Sudjic, Deyan *B is for Bauhaus, Y is for YouTube: Designing the Modern World from A to Z*.

<li>&quot;I went to letterpress artist Ross MacDonald to create a cover reminiscent of an earlier era. Ross hand-set the title and author type from his collection of nearly 400 wood and metal fonts. He also created the logo/dingbat representing an idealized vision of the protagonist as an agent of science and industrialization. It’s fun to create an actual cover using physical objects, but ultimately, of course, the piece was photographed and digitized for our own mass production.&quot;[Vandermeer, Jeff, and Desirina Boskovich *The Steampunk User’s Manual: An Illustrated Practical and Whimsical Guide to Creating Retro-Futurist Dreams*.

<li>&quot;There is a legitimacy to Jobs’s admittedly more expensive “closed system” of mechanism and design, since efficiency and economy are increasingly compatible with aesthetic cohesiveness and harmony. Machines have arrived at the point where revolutionary changes to the mechanism can keep pace or even outstrip design innovations. At the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich ponders the rapidity with which his devices must adapt to the whims of fashion designers with whom he now entertains cooperative ventures.&quot;[(auth.), Timothy J.

<li>&quot;So it is not surprising that I gravitated toward a career which allowed me to express my talents using letterforms (or typography) as a major creative tool: editorial design. For over twenty years, I worked in some pretty intellectually heady environments as a “visual journalist,” that is, as a magazine design director, whose job it was to amplify and clarify the meaning of the written word for the reader, using type and image.&quot;[Saltz, Ina *Body Type 2: More Typographic Tattoos*.

<li>&quot;Milton Glaser has said about Mirko: “He is a designer that draws and an illustrator that thinks. ” Playing with visual analogies, Ilić’s work questions the limit of what can be done in design, bypassing the established design rules while making new use of them. Analogy, juxtaposition, and comparison are recurring techniques used to visually reinforce the editorial content he is given to work with. His book layouts are often built on thought-provoking diptychs, which in essence convey a mental link between two images, i. e. , two concepts.&quot;[Kršić, Dejan *Mirko Ilic: Fist to Face*.

<li>&quot;But now the general trend toward theoretical studies and the use of computer graphics threatens to make engineering drawing itself a lost art. Left: William Binns’s elevation and plan of a black-lead pencil, from his book on orthographic projection (photo credit 15. 3) Right: Binns’s end view and longitudinal section of a pencil designed not to roll easily off the drawing board (photo credit 15. 4) Not only did the use of orthographic projection become standard engineering drawing practice with the maturation of the Industrial Revolution, but the manufacture and use of engineering drawing instruments also soon became more or less codified.&quot;[Petroski, Henry *The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance*. Alfred A. Knopf, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;One of Deskey’s furniture critics also referred to ‘dishonest’ designs, such as those made of metal painted to simulate the appearance of wood, as ‘mongrel’ forms. 72 Interestingly, Dreyfuss’s use of the term resonated with Teague’s concerns, owing to their common interest in the Greek principles of dynamic symmetry. To Dreyfuss, any design that was not geometric in its basic shapes, principles and proportion constituted a ‘mongrel’ form. 73 When ‘mongrel’ designs are contrasted against ‘ideal’ product types, with the difference stemming largely from how closely a product design adhered to what were considered by designers to be the fundamental design laws of nature, it is not surprising that designers insisted upon studying nature and the design of living organisms as the basis for their bringing about ‘pure form’ in streamline product design (such as that exemplified by the blimp or Dreyfuss’s dynamically symmetrical forms). 74 For example, Arens upheld the whale as the best model for ship design, and designers closely studied the intricacies of the salmon and the Pacific plover in order to better understand the streamline adaptations of fishes and birds.&quot;[Brauer, Fae, and Anthea Callen (eds.) *Art, Sex and Eugenics: Corpus Delecti*. Ashgate, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;We see, then-if my contentions are correct-that design is not so much a matter that concerns the shapes we give to in. . , dividual characters which make up the new fount of type as it is a matter that concerns the printed appearance of the page as a whole. Quite frequently the unthinking reader confuses mere me, chanical technique with design. Type design involves crafts. . , manshipof ahigh order; bu tgood technique aloneis not enough. A design devoid of emotion, rhythm, and expression, yet tech. . , nically excellent, merely betrays the fact that it has been pro, duced by one who has nothing of value to express.&quot;[Goudy, Frederic W. *Typologia: Studies in Type Design and Type Making*. University of California Press, 1978.]</li>
<li>&quot;The photographs can only suggest a temporal continuity; they fail, ultimately, in documenting time or motion, the cornerstones of efficiency. Nonetheless, these images represent a shift in Gilbreth’s use of photography from a functional realism (where the image serves as an empirical substitute for the object, as a type of evidence) to an instrumental realism—in this case, using the realist promise of the photograph as truth to restructure the ways work is performed. 23 Here, Gilbreth shifts the role of his images from the generalized illustration of sites and buildings that pervades his earlier publications to a more specific focus on the human body in motion, with the goal of using these new images to intervene in the ways work is performed.&quot;[Ott, Katherine, David Serlin, and Stephen Mihm *Artificial Parts, Practical Lives: Modern Histories of Prosthetics*.

<li>&quot;‘‘Metaphor’s power of reorganizing our perception of things,’’ Ricoeur writes, ‘‘develops from transposition of an entire ‘realm’ ’’ (1984, 236). Ricoeur calls this realm a ‘‘new referential design’’ (230), which I specify as the work’s metaphorical design. Surely design is one of the most recurring words in Absalom, Absalom!, which I want to consider brieﬂy in acknowledgment of Faulkner’s status as literary southern gothic master code. Patriarch Thomas Sutpen’s rags-to-richesto-ruin story—and consequently the novel itself—is motivated by his tragic pursuit of an abstract design without regard to ethical concerns.&quot;[Goodlad, Lauren M.

<li>&quot;Thus, in their hands, “the basic elements of design-size, blank space, color, line, etc. [became] tools for selectivity, simplifying the visual task” of the user. Designing Information (which was planned as a huge volume but published in an abridged form) set out to define design as a tool for achieving the “faster flow of information” through principles of flow and unity. Sutnar and Lönberg-Holm took great pains to demonstrate the process of visualizing information by including scores of charts and graphs that addressed the needs of customers, employees, stockholders, and the general public.&quot;[Heller, Steven *The Graphic Design Reader*.
