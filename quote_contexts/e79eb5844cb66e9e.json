What looks like the accumulation of complexity is often a complexity of specification, not of thought. This pipeline privileges what can be discretised and verified in a single model while displacing modes of architectural reasoning that operate atmospherically, culturally, historically, and theoretically. In other words, the model has become the law from without, and too often the project is asked to reproduce its given form. When Vitruvius talks about the education of the Architect, he portrays the complexity of architecture as being provided by its inherent multi-facetted nature - Let him be educated, skilful with the pencil, instructed in geometry, know much history, have followed the philosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of medicine, know the opinions of the jurists, and be acquainted with astronomy and the theory of the heavens. Yet the prevailing computational encoding habits tend to confine mediation to geometry, letting the non-geometrical dimensions of architecture fall through the digital cracks. It does not allow for the integration of the theoretical, cultural, literary, atmospheric, philosophical and associative dimensions of architectural design or for the flexibility of the design as an idea when mediated by the designer. The consequence of this is not just representational; it is epistemic. Architecture risks forgetting how its media think. In his essay on translations from drawing to building, Robin Evans speaks of the two roles drawings can play within the architectural process:\"The two options, one emphasizing the corporeal properties of things made, the other concentrating on the disembodied properties in the drawing, are diametrically opposed: in the one corner, involvement, substantiality, tangibility, presence, immediacy, direct action; in the other, disengagement, obliqueness, abstraction, mediation and action at a distance.\". Evanss polarity, corporeal involvement versus disembodied abstraction, maps neatly onto our contemporary dilemma. The profession has excelled at the first the tangible model and its deliverables, while the second abstraction as mediating intelligence remains under-instrumentalised in computational practice. Rightly so, Evans does continue to state that although they are \"opposed\" they are not \"necessarily incompatible\". The challenge, then, is to find this compatibility of the corporeal and the abstracted within the digital. To recover the disembodied capacities as operations that relate unlike domains such as drawing, narrative, atmosphere, code, without collapsing them into sameness. Therefore the thinking of architectural modes of media is proposed to be brought into the computational before we can consider how it can be returned onto architecture itself. In contrast to the computational geometrical model in architecture, in digital contexts, space need not be a three-dimensional container at all, but an n-dimensional arrangement of features where relations are learned as proximities and projections. The crucial step is the encoding that makes such spaces operable, an encoding that can and we will argue should include cultural and contextual signals beyond 3D geometry.\n\n*This encoding, which Vitruvius had already implicitly described as a process of cultural and historical embedding, has to be rethought within the digital context. It requires a shift from the representation of buildings as static forms to a representation of buildings as processes, as transformations, as temporal and spatial flows. In this sense, architecture becomes not only a matter of constructing walls and floors but also of designing the relationships between spaces, between materials, between users, and between technologies. This transformation of the architectural project can only be achieved by acknowledging the importance of the non-geometrical dimensions, such as the cultural, the historical, the theoretical, the atmospheric, and the philosophical dimensions.*", "suggested_query": "This encoding, which Vitruvius had already implicitly described as a process of cultural and historical embedding, has to be rethought within the digital context.
