    <pre>Crucially, nothing here is neutral. The instrument is designed to keep a personal and intentionally biased stance operative. Against generic public screens, we work with authored private casts that tune what appears. In practice a curated set of books configures the textual context for a section, and a hand-picked corpus of multi-modal documents (films or pdfs) biases both textual and figurative indices. Public is generic, private is authored: projection becomes proportion, not translation. This bias is not a flaw but the architectonic move: a way to keep difference productive and yet legible.</pre>

      <li>&quot;But this immediacy is only apparent through the mediated temporal and spatial chain to which the newly emergent thing attaches itself. This conclusion leads us to the second, so far inadequately heeded, aspect of non-identical repetition. It concerns the monadological fashion in which each new repetition not only repeats a series of items (stretching back indeﬁnitely), but repeats the process of repetition itself, like the Crunluath a Mach, or fourth movement, invoked by Kirsty Gunn.

<li>&quot;This is why one has interior articulations, different movements within a musical piece, sequences within poems, chapters within novels and then series of novels (Divina Commedia, Barchester Chronicles, Remembrance of Things Past, A Dance to the Music of Time, etc. ), besides new ﬁctional attempts to explore the same set of themes by a single writer, such as Graham Greene’s repeated treatments of treachery and religious conﬂictedness. The theme of an original thing, whether natural or artiﬁcial, cannot be further extended without loss of a genuine sense of iteration, but what can occur instead is repetition at a new meta-level, whereby the individual thing composed of integrated differences is regarded as a differential unit which can be non-identically repeated.&quot;[Pickstock, Catherine *Repetition and identity : the literary agenda*.

<li>&quot;But first, may the person reading these lines take the time to look (Plates 20 and 2I, Figures 20 and 2I; see also the commentary in &quot;Notes on Figures and Plates&quot;). Plates 20 and 2I are from Realitis, while the two double-page spreads are from Illustrations. For convenience, I refer to them by the numbered letters Rr and R2, and II and Iz, respectively. The composition in Realitis has, at its core, a double-page spread in color, based on the R2 model, but with a margin on the left of the image. Bracketing this core are two double pages printed in black and white: R2 and RETURN, AUTO-ILLUSTRATION, DOUBLE REVERSAL the last of the four double pages, identical to Rz; this group itself comes after a double-page spread with a slightly different layout, namely, RI.&quot;[Lyotard, Jean-Francois *Discourse, Figure (Cultural Critique Books)*.

Another way to approach this notion of text is to conceive of it in terms of a radical empiricism, that is, as an empiricism that undoes its own philosophical foundations.&quot;[Gasche, Rodolphe *Of Minimal Things: Studies on the Notion of Relation*.

<li>&quot;Instead of making the content mental, however, the British New Realists make this content non-mental. 125 This distinction for the New Realists is then basically expressible by the following tripartite distinction: mental act, non-mental content, and physical thing. Whereas in the Brentanian tradition the content was a part of a mental act, here the non-mental content becomes a part of a thing. I have throughout this chapter used ‘presentation’, in line with Stout’s terminology, for that which the British New Realism: Language of Madness 69 mental act is most directly related to in its intentionality.&quot;[(auth.), Omar W.

<li>&quot;The work we are speaking of, then, sides with an irreducibly endless series of interfaces. Lacking a determining negation by the other, these figures of thought cannot reflect themselves into mere identity; rather, the work in question remains suspended betwixt and between, to the side of, by right, only a virtual middle between nonidentical interfaces. It follows that the question of the (literal and figural) unity of such work must take a different turn. Although Andrzej Warminski&#x27;s Readings in Interpretation invites its reader to think about such a turn, this work must also be regarded as a book on Holderlin, Hegel, and Heidegger.&quot;[Gasche, Rodolphe *Of Minimal Things: Studies on the Notion of Relation*. Stanford University Press, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;The form in which the pure past makes itself felt in the present, the form in which it is lived, is reminiscence, ‘an involuntary memory which differs in kind from any active synthesis associated with voluntary memory’ (p. 85). Although it is here, Deleuze says, ‘that Proust intervenes, taking up that baton from Bergson’ (p. 84), comparable ideas are certainly to be found in the pure memory in Matter and Memory and the creative emotion of dynamic religion in The Two Sources. The present is the most contracted form of this pure past, but between successive presents, each of which compresses and so repeats the entirety of its respective past, there are ‘non-localisable connections, actions at a distance, systems of replay, resonance and echoes, objective chances, signs, signals and roles’ (Deleuze, 1994, p. 83), so that ‘however strong the incoherence or possible opposition between successive presents, we have the impression that each of them plays out “the same life” at different levels’ (ibid.&quot;[Herzogenrath, Bernd *Time and History in Deleuze and Serres*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Even though I do explore a few other surrounding aspects, there is just so much in Stout that one can easily lose focus. An entire separate work can be written on Stout’s philosophy, which spans at least a fifty-year period, accompanied by many changes and nuanced advances. In this way, I will stick to what is most relevant to the history I expound, especially in relation to the British New Realists and Russell. Chapter 2 is partly set up as a back-and-forth between Stout and Alexander. This will highlight certain interesting features of British New Realism, which I conclude was partly developed in response to Stout.&quot;[(auth.), Omar W. Nasim *Bertrand Russell and the Edwardian Philosophers: Constructing the World*. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The repetition, or, dare I suggest, the eternal return of these basic patterns or forms is best discovered through synthesis rather than analysis, through a comparative methodology. Serres notes that ‘the sailors of yesteryear are the only ones who remember that you can’t reach your destination with just one sea-mark; you need at least two – it’s an error to take only one Time and History in Deleuze and Serres. indb 44 8/16/2011 11:51:26 AM Time Folded and Crumpled 45 alignment reading, in a single direction’ (Serres et al. , 1997, p. 178).&quot;[Herzogenrath, Bernd *Time and History in Deleuze and Serres*.

<li>&quot;24. Gilles Deleuze, Pure Immanence: Essays on a Life, tr. John Rachmann (New York: Zone, 2001). I am grateful to Simone Kotva for pointing out Deleuze’s more open conceptualization of this totality as a ‘Whole’ in Logic of Sense, and elsewhere. 25. See the unpublished and forthcoming writings of Simone Kotva for a nuanced reading of Gilles Deleuze on the ‘trap’ and repetition. 26. To sustain this ‘distinctness’, one might be tempted to adopt a Scotist ‘formal distinction’ of excellencies even within the Godhead.&quot;[Pickstock, Catherine *Repetition and identity : the literary agenda*. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;This analytic work is helpful pedagogically because Deleuze&#x27;s texts are notoriously esoteric. DeLanda, however, does not seem to pose ,the question of why Deleuze changed terms as he moved from problem to problem, one ibook to the next, one set not necessarily consistent with the previous one, and whether Deleuze&#x27;s mode of operation is more than merely accidental or perverse.&quot;[Rabinow, Paul *The Accompaniment: Assembling the Contemporary*.

<li>&quot;I am thinking of one of the most solitary works, the one to which, as though out of friendship and in play, Georges Bataille lent his name. IX The Limit-Experience i Affirmation and the passion of negative thought Permit me, in thinking of Georges Bataille, to think in proximity to an absence rather than claiming to set forth what everyone should be able to find in his books—books that in no way constitute a minor part, the simple trace of a presence that has disappeared.&quot;[Blanchot, Maurice *The Infinite Conversation*.
