<li>&quot;Alfred R. Radcliffe-Brown (1922) limits discussion of the origins and motives of dressing the body to a narrow view of dress as personal ornament. In this excerpt, drawn from a chapter in his book, he questions the meaning and social function of personal ornament. Radcliffe-Brown does not use the term dress or clothing in this discussion but discusses modifications made to the body along with supplements such as necklaces.&quot;[Johnson, Kim K. P., Susan J. Torntore, and Joanne B. Eicher *Fashion Foundations: Early Writings on Fashion and Dress*. Berg Publishers, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Just as badges derive from trophies, ornament evolves from badges, for an ornament symbolically represents the original badge. To Spencer, clothing has the same capabilities as a badge in symbolically designating prestige and social position or class distinctions, and in fact as society becomes complex, items of decorative clothing or adornment become distinctive of rank and position. Georg Simmel (1904), in his classic discussion of fashion change, points out that fashion is a process of imitation, not evolution.&quot;[Johnson, Kim K. P., Susan J. Torntore, and Joanne B.

<li>&quot;Therefore, it seems justified to analyze the decoration of these figurines as a proxy for human body treatment. The transferability of ornamental motifs and compositions between material culture and tattoo designs is known from ethnographic documents and is considered a potential correlate for temporary and permanent prehistoric body art (Streit 1935:681). Nevertheless, this transferability of patterns and designs also makes it difficult to determine whether ornamentation depicted on figurines represents textile patterns or body art forms, since costume design may also be decorated with linear ornamentation (e. g. , Lüning 2005).&quot;[Krutak, Lars, and Aaron Deter-Wolf *Ancient Ink: The Archaeology of Tattooing*.

<li>&quot;The gable or the fastigium is only the externally visible representative, the  leader of the chorus (hegemon), so to speak, for a series of similar structural  triangles that form the structure of the roof. Here and in similar cases art tries  to provide an external, aesthetically com prehensible indication of what is  present without being seen but only represented. It uses means drawn from  reality, but it does so no more by imitation or literal, slavish translation of the  motive (such as transposing a timber-beam system into a stone style) than by  any strict logic. It grasps the abstract-formal concept and reproduces it almost  playfully in a decorative symbolism, striving only for aesthetic consistency. &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Richard Phillips: London. Historic Textile and Costume Collection, University of Rhode Island. The word “dress” appears more frequently than “costume” to label outfits in this book of fashion plates. arguing that modifications of the body include those both permanent and temporary such as scarification and makeup and that supplements to the body include such items as clothing, accessories, and handheld objects. They claimed that this definition of dress “is unambiguous, free of personal or social valuing or bias, usable in descriptions across national and cultural boundaries, and inclusive of all phenomena that can accurately be identified as dress. ” In 1995, Joanne Eicher along with Barbara Sumberg extended the discussion of the term “dress” by critiquing the phrase “western dress. ” They claimed that “designating items as western for people who wear them in other areas of the world, such as Asia or Africa, is inaccurate” (296).&quot;[Welters, Linda, and Abby Lillethun *Fashion History: A Global View*.

<li>&quot;Roach-Higgins and Eicher opposed the use of the term “costume” as an all-encompassing and neutral term because by the late twentieth century, it referred to dress for special activities or role-play, such as performance, folk festivals, ceremonies, and rituals. They called this dress for “out-of-everyday” activities. In surveying nineteenth-century fashion images, “costume” appears with regularity in reference to a total ensemble. The OED recognized this usage in a third definition for “costume”: “fashion or styles of dress appropriate to any occasion or season; hence, dress considered with regard to its fashion or style. ” An example of period usage is provided: La Belle Assemblée, an English lady’s magazine, included an “outdoor costume” in its May 1818 issue.&quot;[Welters, Linda, and Abby Lillethun *Fashion History: A Global View*.

<li>&quot;S 115 The Significance of Ceramics for Architecture We conclude this chapter on the aesthetic-formal elements of the vessel art by  pointing to the great significance of its repertory of forms —which developed  out of both utilitarian and technical conditions —to the traditional formal  language of all the arts and for architecture in particular. Not only are the  general architectural principles of formal articulation and the contrasts  between the parts that compose this articulation exactly the same as the principles we have just discussed, but architecture also obviously borrowed many  of the traditional signs and the terms of its formal artistic language from the  earlier vessel art. Even the prevailing techniques of potters, as will be shown,  have often had a quite direct effect on the generation of new architectural  principles. &quot;[INPUT: Semper__Style_in_the_Technical_and_Tectonic_Arts_or_Practical_Aesthetics.pdf]</li>

Cultural items that are mechanically reproduced. widely available. inexpensive. and overtly designed as commodities for mass consumption are. by definition. excluded from the category of &quot;real&quot; art. While there is often an interesting cross-fertiliZing connection between popular cultural materials and so-called &quot;high&quot; art (see Crane. 1987; Nye. 1972; Gans. 1974; Browne. 1983; Hirschman. 1981). the overt consumer focus and highly formulaic character of popular culture makes these materials unlikely candidates for artistic certification.&quot;[Sanders, Clinton, and D Angus Vail *Customizing the Body: The Art and Culture of Tattooing*.

<li>&quot;All or any decree handed down by the monarch is so invalid&#x27;. (Cabral 1967: 105-106). In the context of the development of Brazilian culture, I would like to call attention to the meaning of Carnival that can be inferred from the texts of the modern art movement (&#x27;modernismo&#x27;) of 1922. For them, Carnival is of a Dionysian type. First, the meaning of &#x27;pau-brasil&#x27; is outlined. In this poetry, Carnival means &#x27;race festivity&#x27;, and race means a mixture of &#x27;jungle&#x27; and &#x27;school&#x27;. This meaning of &#x27;pau-brasil&#x27; (a kind of wood that gave its name to the country) leads to an anthropophagic meaning.&quot;[Eco, Umberto, Vjačeslav V. Ivanov, Thomas A. Sebeok, Marcia E.

<li>&quot;122 / DAVID FELDMAN Why Is a Riding Costume Called a Habit?Habit is a Middle English word. Originally it referred to any dress or costume, then to any dress worn “habitually,” such as a uniform. Habit was also applied to certain costumes worn only for certain occasions, such as a riding habit or a fencer’s suit. All of these meanings precede our primary contemporary use of habit as something done automatically and often involuntarily.&quot;[Feldman, David, and Kassie Schwan *Who Put the Butter in Butterfly?: And Other Fearless Investigations into Our Illogical Language*.

<li>&quot;Aristocrats would use its exuberance in design to flex their riches to visitors, bragging about their wealth and power with architecture, art, and interior design. Brass, gold, gilded surfaces, brocades, marble, and onyx are only some of the opulent materials used to define the language of Baroque design—quite the opposite of using a fibrous and recyclable material like cardboard. Because of this utilitarian quality of cardboard, Jillian’s pieces take on more meaning than simply beautifully constructed ornamentation.&quot;[Zimmer, Lori *The Art of Cardboard: Big Ideas for Creativity, Collaboration, Storytelling, and Reuse*.

<li>&quot;A long tradition sees make-up as part of the feminine repertoire of masquerade techniques, an artifice used to disguise authentic identity. Whereas in pre-modern or tribal societies facial decoration reflected group identity, in the modern West it functions as a marker of individual identity more than social emplacement, 58 The Nudity/Clothing Dialectic except, perhaps, in subcultural uses. Its use outside of ritual or theatrical contexts has by and large become restricted to women, which is partly why it has been subject to moral judgement: “Whereas body decoration is regarded as active and purposeful behaviour, the use of make-up and cosmetics is interpreted as passive and trivial behaviour” (Craik 1994: 153–4).&quot;[Barcan, Ruth *Nudity: A Cultural Anatomy*. Berg Publishers, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;Iconologists often call the process by which two icons come to have the same symbols but different meanings “pseudomorphosis” or even (to imply an even more dramatic transposition of meanings and styles) “synthomorphosis. ”38 Classical examples of pseudomorphosis came from medieval or Renaissance art, where, for example, Father Time figures with Saturn’s attributes and blind putti recall ancient Cupids. But cases of pseudomorphosis were common in modern art as well.&quot;[Viano, Francesca Lidia *Sentinel: The Unlikely Origins of the Statue of Liberty*. Harvard University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;On the contrary, it is the particular way of wearing these clothes which constitutes dandyism. ”13 It is in this “particular way of wearing . . . clothes” that dandies transform their bodies into art. Clothing rests close to the body; it is not surprising that dress has its somatic reverberations in disguise and displacement, and that it can be the material of self-transformation and artistic transformation. In fact, as Barbey d’Aurevilly’s analysis of Brummell’s dandyism reminds us, the dandy is both artist and living art: his presence has a doubled density.&quot;[Fillin-Yeh, Susan *Dandies: Fashion and Finesse in Art and Culture*.
