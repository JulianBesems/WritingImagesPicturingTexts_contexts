Selected: From this perspective, the “idea” – that is the starting point in most design models – is obtained at the end, after the confrontation of media and the use of multiple tools and not at the beginning. This is an important aspect of a model of design as a plane of composition. Through confrontation, designers engage in a dialog with previous artifacts as sources for the composition. The contrasting semiotic analysis as well as the constellation of tools, but also moodboards,64 or materiautheques65 are a deliberate organization of the composition space, a net to catch the elements that might lead to a new design.[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]

01. "Books that teach design or architecture emphasize the need to learn through studying former buildings or artifacts. 8,9 The role of former knowledge in design is therefore extremely important and has been studied, for instance, by Willemin Visser who points out the reuse of knowledge in different circumstances and fields of design: Reuse of knowledge (from specific previous design projects) through analogical reasoning has been observed in many cognitive design studies as a central approach in design. ”10 Former knowledge plays a part in the heuristics of the project as design memory11 or design precedents. 12 Eilouti also looks at design precedents and how they are part of an analogy process that feeds new artifacts."[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]

02. "Doing so means switching from a temporal, chronological, model of the design project to a spatial, topological, model of design and to look at how the expression “design space” can be interpreted as a “matrix”, as the French philosopher of design 4 Some pictures of famous artists’ studios can be found on this website: http://www. artistsandillustrators. co. uk/news/Buildings-Architecture/530/famous-artists-studios 5 See for instance, in Paris, http://www. lelieududesign. com/la-materiautheque-materio 6 Hockney (2006)."[ The In-Discipline of Design: Bridging the Gap Between Humanities and Engineering, Annie Gentes (auth.), 2017]

03. "Because once again, as architects have learned in the daily practice of computer-based design and fabrication, digital postmodernity is upending the game, creating a new environment and new practices that are much closer to our premodern, artisanal past than to our modern, industrial present. The principles of nonstandard seriality in digital making are now almost twenty years old, and their potentials and limits have been tested by the digital avantgarde in architecture since the early 1990s. Unlike mechanical making, digital making is rarely matrixbased, hence using file-to-factory digital technologies it is theoretically possible to massproduce variations, within limits, at no extra cost."[INPUT: Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn.pdf]

05. "With different nuances, and with some exceptions —of which adaptive fabrication and hard-core morphogenetic design may be the most conspicuous —the second digital turn in architecture is largely about finding new ways to design, not about finding ways to not design. Not designing may be an ideological statement or a profession of faith, but it is unlikely to ever become a well-paid profession; while some digitally intelligent designers pride themselves on using open-source software, few or none author open-ended design—architectural notations that others could modify at will. 21 As will be seen in chapter 5, the ideas of permanent variability, parametric mass customization, and digitally driven mass collaboration that designers test-drove during the age of the first digital turn are now spreading in all areas of contemporary society, economy, and politics."[INPUT: Carpo__The_Second_Digital_Turn.pdf]

07. "These groups traditionally contribute through different forms of expression (artifacts, essays, scientiﬁc studies, and so on). Articulation work is essential in creating the necessary conditions for communication and growth of interpersonal knowledge. A feature of the use qualities I propose here is that they are applicable to new design situations beyond the examples used to illustrate them, still not uncritically generalized. In fact, this feature points toward another important aspect of the knowledge construction of interaction design, namely, the notion of genres."[Aesthetic Computing, Paul A. Fishwick, 2006]

08. "None of the qualities are unique in themselves, but their particular combination goes a long way in delineating digital encyclopaedias as a possible genre of digital designs. Jonas Löwgren 400 To summarize, I view interaction design as a ﬁeld in which there is potential for a knowledge-constructing design culture to evolve. Such a design culture requires the participation of designers, critics, and researchers in the ongoing construction and reconstruction of interpersonal design knowledge. Articulating use qualities of digital designs may be a step in that direction, provided the aesthetic dimensions of good use are also recognized outside the rather exclusive ﬁeld of digital arts."[Aesthetic Computing, Paul A.

"This discussion could help extend the current interchangeable and nondescript use of ‘fun, pleasure and enjoyment’ in UX practice into a wider-ranging ‘experience’ vocabuÂ�lary as well as establish them as distinct markers outlining a rich experience landscape.
