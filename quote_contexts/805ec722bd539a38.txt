Selected: Homogeneous space is in no way a smooth space; on the contrary, it is the form of striated space. The space of pillars. It is striated by the fall of bodies, the verticals of gravity, the distribution of matter into parallel layers, the lamellar and laminar movement of flows.[Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari *A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia*. University of Minnesota Press, 1988.]
