Instead, we treat them as a field of possibilities and domains against which any digital architectural instrument has to be positioned. Such an instrument must leave room for textual, temporal, atmospheric and scalar operations that cannot be collapsed into geometry or into a single logic of optimisation. If architecture is partly constituted by what it does across media, it must accept that some of its crucial operations live in probabilities, atmospheres, and misalignments.", "suggested_query": "the digital architectural encodings dealing with the non-geometrical should be closer to Wittgensteins later understanding of language as an activity than to his early picture theory. As he puts it in the Philosophical Investigations: I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the activities into which it is woven, a language-game. The point is not that architecture becomes mere language, but that its digital models must accommodate the language-games that extend beyond form: the ways they stage, distort and extend architectural conversations across media, times and publics. This requires a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between language, architecture, and the digital, one that moves beyond the simplistic oppositions of the digital native versus the digital immigrant. It demands an acknowledgment of the complexities of the digital, where the boundaries between language, architecture, and the digital are blurred, and the digital is not a fixed or stable entity, but a constantly evolving and evolving field of possibilities.", "suggest_context": "From the vantage point of CADBIM, this second language is deeply inconvenient. A BIM model is well suited to Eisenmans early synthesis of form, structure, technics and function; it has no native concept of a differential network of traces, of dislocating events that put origins and authorities in motion. At best, these appear as external annotations attached to an otherwise stable object. At this point, the distance to the contemporary digital condition described by Hovestadt becomes clear. In the introduction to Atlas of Digital Architecture he insists that information technology touches, it infuses, inhabits, everything, and that absolutely everything we do and have today is in one way or another possessed of digitality. \"Today\", he writes, \"we have an abundance of images, indexes, references,\" and digitality is reaching omnipresence, such that the real challenge is not growing complexity but an overwhelming simplicity in which its not us who understand computers any longer, its computers that understand us, leading to saturation rather than scarcity. In such a saturated, generic field, architectures, models and images circulate as part of a shared, indexed background. The projects we recognise as masterpieces do not prefigure this condition, but they show why a purely geometric encoding is insufficient: each already depends on disciplinary memory, narrative, atmosphere and use in excess of its measurable form. These extra-geometric operations are precisely what allow such works to persist, to be re-read and re-indexed within todays digital abundance. In this sense, digital architectural encodings dealing with the non-geometrical cannot rely only on a structuralist idea of form as total code; they must also register the fluid, indexical and sometimes misaligned operations through which architecture participates in this digitally saturated field. The emphasis thus shifts from what is modelled to how we think with models: what kinds of games, stories, projections and mis-readings our digital instruments permit. In this sense, the digital architectural encodings dealing with the non-geometrical should be closer to Wittgensteins later understanding of language as an activity than to his early picture theory. As he puts it in the Philosophical Investigations: I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the activities into which it is woven, a language-game. The point is not that architecture becomes mere language, but that its digital models must accommodate the language-games that extend beyond form: the ways they stage, distort and extend architectural conversations across media, times and publics.
