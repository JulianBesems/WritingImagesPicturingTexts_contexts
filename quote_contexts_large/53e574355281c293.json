{"created_at": 1766098579.20684, "confirmed": true, "origin": "suggested", "search_input": "Instead of relying on computation to collect and internalise all modes of representation in a single relation, this thesis is concerned with how we create talks between them on a level of abstraction that doesnt define the outcome as a linear result of the base. We regard the 3D model as one member of a multimodal ensemble: indispensable where geometry is at stake, yet insufficient as the locus of architectural knowledge. To arrive at a setup that allows for this other aspect, we focus on modalities that currently dominate digital multimodality - text and image - because contemporary machine learning models operate most powerfully across these domains. As an alternative approach to mediate between modes of communications, computational processes are tuned to offer means of projecting between domains in non-systematic matters: focussing on association and on navigating the digital plenty that we have at our disposal. This proposes a non-linear model that facilitates the communication between domains, maintaining a proportionality. Focussed on facilitating an understanding. These associations are approached as invitations into conversation. As stated by Valry, as soon as we make a comparison it is not moving and we are not entering the relation between the objects. Comparison communicates through distance, difference, and proximity; it tends to stabilise. Instead of focussing only on what is close and similar, the scope here is to explore a means of association that forms constellations, what Ishigami calls an approachable abstraction. These constellations are treated as indefinite and ambiguous clusters of things that might engage in talks, much like the Kunstkammer as discussed by Horst Bredekamp. Within this context, machine learning ML is approached less as an means of classification or generation, and more as a family of techniques that enable projections within domains and between domains. Examples range from self-organising maps SOM to contemporary textimage systems. Although these projections rest on encoding domains into vectors between which distances can be measured the relations they establish do not behave like a single explicit function that can be written down in advance. Using ML methods, the projection from a domain to a co-domain follows contingent relations established through associations of data. Removing a strictly linear connection between domain and co-domain has the potential to lift the resulting architectonic connection out of geometry onto a communication between non-commensurable fields. This does not mean abandoning geometry; rather it means resisting its monopolisation. It will rely on discerning proportionalities between domains instead of translating them into the same common set, comparable to the proportion between plan and section. These domains in architecture are not the same, nor can they be reduced to one field; they need to stand orthogonal to each other to bear meaning. Within that scope, we treat ML as a non-systematic means of orienting qualitative data: facilitating projections within and between domains that do not follow a pre-declared mathematical function, and thereby tuning indefinite and ambiguous constellations of communication.\n\n*This approach does not eliminate the necessity of geometry, but rather complements it with other modalities that can capture the complexity of architectural knowledge. By acknowledging the limits of geometry, we can start to think about how to negotiate between different domains and their respective modes of representation. For instance, the text-based modality can be used to describe the spatial layout of a building, while the image-based modality can be used to convey the aesthetic and visual aspects of the architecture. By tuning these modalities together, we can create a more comprehensive understanding of the architecture.*", "suggested_query": "This approach does not eliminate the necessity of geometry, but rather complements it with other modalities that can capture the complexity of architectural knowledge.
