Selected: But now everything in regard to objects of experience is necessary without which the experience of these objects itself would be impossible. Thus it is necessary for all substances in appearance, insofar as they are simultaneous, to stand in thoroughgoing community of interaction with each other. The word "community"b is ambiguous in our language, and can mean either communio or commercium. c We use it here in the latter sense, as a dynamical community, without which even the local community (communio spatii)d could never be empirically cognized.[Immanuel Kant, Paul Guyer (Editor, Allen W.

02. "There is another possible book that contains all that is not in this one. In that book, other habits take center stage, other unfamiliar experiences are recorded, and the jokes are told all the way to the end. That book’s disadvantage, though, would be its exclusion of what is published here. It would omit these gathered experiences in favor of others. That other book might have a different tenor: it might perhaps be more critical in tone, be more analytical in approach, contain more argumentative opinion."[Cole, Teju *Known and strange things: Essays*.

11. "When the young undergraduate student William Empson (1906–84) set out his somewhat mathematically minded views on the multiple meanings of words in literature in Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930), he created a worry-reader’s text book. Empson examined the capacity of words to create meanings that affirmed, extended, resisted, or flatly contradicted other meanings. He was interested in the different accounts each word or sentence could give of itself, in how many different ways a word or sentence could suggest different simultaneous meanings, even meanings that resulted in radical contradiction (that is the seventh type of ambiguity)."[O’Gorman, Francis *Worrying: A Literary and Cultural History*.

12. "So I asked Mike to lunch at the university club. I asked him if he wanted to write a book with me. Let’s find those ordinary stories, I proposed. Let’s collect them from the men and women who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Shockingly, Mike agreed. And this is our book. How to Read This Book This book can be read from cover to cover and front to back—the chapters are arranged thematically to follow a kind of narrative arc, from enlistment to homecoming and from past to present—but it is not necessarily designed to be read in an orderly fashion."[Eide, Marian, and Michael Gibler *After Combat: True War Stories from Iraq and Afghanistan*.

13. "A keyword in Pascal’s Pensées is preuves. The concept of evidence (or rather, the family of concepts associated with this word in modern English) is peculiar to the English language, and so is the mode of thinking associated with it. 144 EXPERIENCE AND EVIDENCE 3. 6. Concluding Remarks: Semantics, Culture, and Society The story of evidence told in this chapter is, of course, incomplete, and it raises a host of questions for future research. In particular, it is important to ﬁnd out how the keyword evidence is used in different varieties of English (e. g. , American English vs. British English), different registers (e. g. , scientiﬁc, political, religious), different modalities (e. g. , oral vs. written), different genres (e. g. , public debates, interviews, informal academic discussions, encyclopedic exposition), and so on."[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*.

15. "If any part of this science is omitted, then its explanation can be ⟨deduced⟩ by the wise from the bases of this science ⟨that we give⟩. The benefit of this book is clear and obvious. For whoever wants to begin to teach astrology, by his reading and understanding of this book he has no need for reading any ⟨other⟩ book on the introduction to the knowledge of astrology, and by his reading of this book alone he will be informed of the things which he is not informed of by reading a book by any previous author, because I have collected in it the principles of this art and I have revealed those of the secrets of this science that were hidden from the majority of the earlier scholars of this art, and I have disclosed from its esoteric part (the inner meaning) what should not be hidden to anyone of those who read something of the principles of the science of astrology which he needs."[Abū Maʿšar, Ǧaʿfar b.
