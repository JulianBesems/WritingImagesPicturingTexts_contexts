Suppose we live on an island where three and only three types of trees grow, (1) a tree that is conical in shape with thin leaves called needles that grow all year around; (2) a tree with flat leaves the size of the palm of one’s hand that dry up and drop off each Fall and are replaced in the Spring; and (3) a tree with a long bare trunk and a shallow spread of what 170 REFLECTIVE ANALYSIS might be considered very large leaves called fronds growing only at the very top.[Embree, Lester *Reflective Analysis: A First Introduction into Phenomenological Investigation*. 2nd.

In that book, other habits take center stage, other unfamiliar experiences are recorded, and the jokes are told all the way to the end.

That other book might have a different tenor: it might perhaps be more critical in tone, be more analytical in approach, contain more argumentative opinion."[Cole, Teju *Known and strange things: Essays*.

Following Chris’s turn in response to Mrs. Turner’s question “what would that box have to have to make it a cube?”, I (R = Roth) utter, “how could you make a cube from pizza boxes?” (turn 24)."[Roth, Wolff-Michael *Geometry as Objective Science in Elementary School Classrooms: Mathematics in the Flesh*.
