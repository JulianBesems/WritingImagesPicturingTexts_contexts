      <li>&quot;We are all, in a sense, cheap knock-offs of ourselves. This sounds like a metaphor at best, madness at worse. A dancing cow onscreen is what it is because it participates in an abstract data structure or resource—a file on some hard disk or server, saved as dancingcow. jpg. That makes sense. But a real cow doesn’t work like that. Cows come from cows, not some abstract Form of Cow-ness.

<li>&quot;This of course poses problems for Taussig’s thesis on the mimetic faculty applied to Kuna ontology. Although his argument is an interesting digression on Benjamin’s reassessment of mimesis, I suggest it does not shed much light on the Kuna theory of images. 12 Fortis-final. indb 12 | Kuna Art and Shamanism 10/4/12 4:53:35 PM As might already be evident, the position that I adopt in this work is to follow Kuna categories as closely as possible, using only them to understand the world as they see it. In so doing, I come to a different conclusion from that reached by Taussig.&quot;[Fortis, Paolo *Kuna Art and Shamanism: An Ethnographic Approach*. University of Texas Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;These girls aren’t so much “wild” as eager for approval. Let’s put aside the obvious moral problems these films present and instead celebrate how sexy they are. Normal porn is now so candid and formulaic that it can pass across the retina unaddressed like an escalator handrail, but this evil smut is sufficiently tethered to reality to trick the wank-weary mind into stiff, prickly interest.&quot;[Brand, Russell *Booky Wook 2: This Time It&#x27;s Personal*.

<li>&quot;See, for example, Frieda Goldman-Eisler, &quot;A Comparative Study of Two Hesitation Phenomena,&quot; Language and Speech, IV, pt. 1 (1961): 18-26; H. Maclay and C. E. Osgood, &quot;Hesitation Phenomena in Spontaneous English Speech,&quot; Word, XV (1959): 19-37; Donald S. Boomer, &quot;Hesitation and Grammatical Encoding,&quot; Language and Speech, VIII (1965): 148-158. On the whole, this work is methodologically neat and tidy. However, it fails to give much attention to the central sociological issue of the rights an individual has to be hesitant and the role he is in while heSitating.&quot;[Goffman, Erving *Frame Analysis.

<li>&quot;I would take as one particularly strong example Bacon’s preferred portrait of Leiris (the portraits of 1976 and 1978 are reproduced in Interviews, 146–7). 6 I draw this term exscription from Nancy’s essay on Bataille. It captures powerfully the metaphor of writing that Heidegger employs to capture the manner in which a work of art draws out difference as a material relation of world and earth, but it also introduces in an important way the problematic of existence. See ‘L’Excrit’, in Une pensée finie (Galilée, Paris, 1990), pp.&quot;[Golding, Dr Sue, and Sue Golding *The Eight Technologies of Otherness*. Routledge, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot; Universal Text, Generic Code, Pre-Specific Data Universal text, I will argue, manifests not only a kind of writing that  is more profound, and more abstractly decoupled from writing that  captures and represents voice and articulation, as Derrida suggests. Universal text also manifests as a generic body-to-think-in, along the  following lines : (1) like language, universal text is collectively engendered before it can be individually appropriated; but, also like language,  it dies, turns stiff and formulaic once it ceases to be inhabited; (2) a  generic body-to-think-in does of course have a form of organization,  but the referent of this form is not transcendent to it, rather it is engendered in an immanent manner.&quot;[INPUT: Hovestadt and Bühlmann - 2014 - Domesticating symbols metalithikum.

<li>&quot;See Hudson, op. cit. , xxiii. Also, on the related matter of “praise-abuse,” Bakhtin, op. cit. , 458: “The virginal words of the oral vernacular which entered literary language for the first time are close, in a certain sense, to proper nouns. They are individualized and still contain a strong element of praise-abuse, which makes them suitable to nicknames. ” On word-formation in Rabelais (often suggestive for Feste’s “gracious fooling”), see Leo Spitzer, Linguistics and Literary History (Princeton, 1948).&quot;[Hartman, Geoffrey H., and Patricia A Parker *Shakespeare and the Question of Theory*.

<li>&quot;The prisoners are being forced to watch a kind of shadow-puppetry—but then again not. Shadow-puppetry—popular art form in many parts of the world—is usually set up like so. You see?The light is coming from the wrong side, for purposes of comparisons to Plato. He is giving us a physical set-up much more reminiscent of a modern cinema. 30 Plato Imagine the various artifacts carried along the wall as individual film cells, parading past a projector’s light. It’s remarkable: Plato invented the first film projector!&quot;[Holbo, John, and Belle Waring *Reason &amp; Persuasion: Three Dialogues by Plato: Euthyphro, Meno, Republic, Book 1*. 3rd ed.

<li>&quot;And yet one wonders about this “adjustment. ” For the world of art is also a social world, de¬ manding the collaboration of many minds and hands. To “shoot for perfection on one’s own terms” is brave talk, but one must also learn and take from others. Collective integrity makes individual integrity more possible. And what is so obvi¬ ously true of an art like acting is also true of what seems to be so purely personal and individual an art like writing. The great writers sought not “perfection,” but to transmit clearly what they had learned from others and through their own engagement in society.&quot;[Finkelstein, Sidney *Existentialism and alienation in American literature*. 3rd printing. New York: International Publishers, 1968.]</li>
<li>&quot;This confirms a long-held belief of mine that lexical order induces thermodynamic order. The lexical order of an amulet reinforces the order a body already possesses, thus providing protection against damage. The lexical order of an animating name increases the order of a body, thus providing motive power for an automaton. &quot;The next question was, how would an increase in order be reflected in organic matter?&quot;[Chiang, Ted *Stories of Your Life and Others*. Pan Macmillan, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;It was useless. I didn’t have an ending. Not only didn’t I have an ending, I didn’t have my God. At one point the alien-devil sends out a shaft of light that we’re supposed to believe is God. So what does God look like?Initially I intended to use a stylized Jesus Christ–like figure but then Roddenberry made his salient point: God is different for everybody. So we also needed God. We were going to have George Lucas’s Industrial Light and Magic create God for us. George Lucas!Just imagine George Lucas’s vision of God.&quot;[Fisher, David, and William Shatner *Up Till Now. The Autobiography*. New York: St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Except for a handful of linguistic primitives, all word meaning relies on examples because we can relate them to experience in memory or imagination. Irony is an especially complex concept in language; in desperation dictionaries try to convey its meaning by using a variety of examples. As this book demonstrates, an exploration of irony is very rich; exhibiting so many forms that it becomes a probe into the human social and cultural condition. Robbie Burns expressed it in a way that we cannot forget: The best-laid schemes o’ mice an ‘men Gang aft agley, An’lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain, For promis’d joy!&quot;[Szenberg, Michael, and Lall Ramrattan (auth.) *Economic Ironies Throughout History: Applied Philosophical Insights for Modern Life*.

<li>&quot;EE 1229a25; NE 1145b11; Cat. 10a1; see also the noun form at Part. an. 651a4). 14 Siwek (1963) is surely right in his note ad loc. : “eorum ‘impetuosities,’ i. e. intensities imagine. ” On melancholy, see Philip J. van der Eijk, “Aristotle on Melancholy,” in van der Eijk (2005), 139– 68. Aristotle on Foresight through Dreams • 101 says it is a skill of seeing likenesses (the same quality he claims for those good at metaphor). 15 The dream image is broken up by other movements in the soul and so is fragmented, like a reflection in rippled water, and a distinct skill is required to reassemble it.&quot;[Struck, Peter T. *Divination and Human Nature: A Cognitive History of Intuition in Classical Antiquity*.

<li>&quot;In Europe, we now see another tack taken, and the traditional folklore of Christmas has become integral to more recent horror films like Finland’s Rare Exports and Holland’s Sint (“Saint”) with their Krampus-like and St. Nicholas-inspired figures coming from within the holiday traditions. The 2010 release date of the two films notably corresponds with the recent international uptick of interest in the traditions discussed in this book. It is, of course, not the shock of radical new juxtapositions or subversive frisson Europeans experience in the Krampus, as he’s been around in one form another since the 18th century.&quot;[Al Ridenour *The Krampus and the Old, Dark Christmas: Roots and Rebirth of the Folkloric Devil*.
