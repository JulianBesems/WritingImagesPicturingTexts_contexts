Its forms of expression in Greek  are these: groundplan, elevation, and perspective. A groundplan is made by the proper successive use of compasses and rule, through which we get outlines for the plane surfaces of buildings. An elevation is a picture of the front of a building, set upright and properly drawn in the proportions of the contemplated work. Perspective is the method of sketching a front with the sides withdrawing into the background, the lines all meeting in the centre of a circle. All three come of reflexion and invention. Reflexion is careful and laborious thought, and watchful attention directed to the agreeable effect of ones plan. Invention, on the other hand, is the solving of intricate problems and the discovery of new principles by means of brilliancy and versatility. These are the departments belonging under Arrangement. - Vitruvius, The Ten books on architecture In similar fashion to how Vitruvius foregrounded the multidisciplinary nature of Architecture see 1.1, he outlines in a precise way how the process of design operates within a terrain that is inherently multimodal. Crucially he identifies the way in which the different expressions come together through the two operations of reflexion and invention, thus not just identifying them as representations, but instead the domains across which the central actions of arrangement takes place. A later cycle, in a different mode of the same sensibility, is found in the Ten Books of Architecture by Alberti: But I can say this of myself: I have often conceived of projects in the mind that seemed quite commendable at the time; but when I translated them into drawings, I found several errors in the very parts that delighted me most, and quite serious ones; again, when I return to drawings, and measure the dimensions, I recognize and lament my carelessness; finally, when I pass from the drawings to the model, I sometimes notice further mistakes in the individual parts, even over the numbers. For all this I would not expect him to be a Zeuxis in his painting, or a Nichomachus in arithmetic, or an Archimedes in geometry. Let it be enough that he has a grasp of those elements of painting of which we have written; that he has sufficient knowledge of mathematics for the practical and considered application of angles, numbers, and lines, such as that discussed under the topic of weights and the measurements of surfaces and bodies, which some called podismata and embata.- Alberti, On the art of building: in ten books\n\n*The architect must be skilled in both the visual and mathematical realms, and possess the ability to reconcile their disparate elements. In the realm of visual expression, the architect must be able to discern the potential of the design to evoke a sense of harmony and balance. Meanwhile, in the realm of mathematics, the architect must be able to apply the principles of geometry and measurement to ensure the structural integrity of the building.
