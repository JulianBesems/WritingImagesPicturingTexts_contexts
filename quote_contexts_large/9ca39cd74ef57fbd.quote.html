      <li>&quot;*By arranging different contexts and atmospheres, the player dances with a book, with the library it is a part of, and its concepts. As an offering, a book captivated by each new context offers more than its author conceived. A book has a life of its own; it is a complex character* — **Interesting take for how the fragmentation of things can offer new perspectives** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=330&amp;annotation=LJX36V79)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*An Informational Instrument celebrates these contradictions without having an explicit a priori base unit. It opens a different perspective. What if the emphasis is not on measuring reality but on encoding and decoding it in many ways, by crafting different keys to access the world in many ways? What if it is about articulating faces and mixing libraries? It is a different game then. You are not looking for specific properties to measure, but are trying to develop a communication channel through which you can articulate profiles of different encodings. This is the search for the most general and abstract ingredients in a given situation. There is no base unit of a book. Yet, in a Plentiful Play books are profiling libraries from many perspectives simultaneously. A book becomes a constitutive part of a character of an alphabet that articulates its library—a symbolic void element* — **Interesting to relate to groups, rings, and bodies** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=308&amp;annotation=4WBUS9PP)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*A book is never specific. There is a specific reading of a book, but the book itself is prior to any specification. For more on pre-specifics, see Bühlmann and Wiedmer, Pre-Specifics.* [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=330&amp;annotation=G6NVQAEN)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*It is not about looking at a book from a specific perspective, but about giving it a different milieu to react with and present itself in.* [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=306&amp;annotation=9ZM3CEQI)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*concept of the universe as a living mirror, where each part reflects the whole* — **Interesting way of thinking of ML, where the expression of a entity is entirely defined by the whole set** [02.c summary.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JJWF3MAS?page=1&amp;annotation=CCZ8TDT8)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Again, this small play was taken place with-out imposing any predefined and external categories on books.* — **Question of categorisation of things through context is useful. Could evolve in the vectorisation of activated SOM. Another inversion by shelves of new and current things. Might be conceptually relatable to the renaissance study of astronomy (ludger piece in coding as literacy)** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=370&amp;annotation=ZT8EKUYM)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Either the text is ruled by the image (as in those paintings where a book , an inscrip­ tion, a letter, or the name of a person are represented); or else the image is ruled by the text (as in books where a draw ing complet es, as if it were merely tak­ ing a short cut, the mess age that words are charged to represent)* — **Important to understand the dynamic** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=44&amp;annotation=7D7LXDYL)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The world model is, therefore, undoubtedly “exhaustive” and “resolved” within itself, hence the character of Totalvorstellung. However, it can never be “exhausted” nor lead to a definitive “solu­ tion,” as this would confer the systematic character proper to the world image* — **Relevant for the digital twin argument and the question of what an image is, as an absolute in relation to text.** [Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7EH52CZI?page=43&amp;annotation=MBIVBTDN)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*But since individuality in its activity should show itself to be alive, or in its thinking should grasp the living world as a system of thought, there would have to be present in thought itself a content for that individuality, in the one case a content of what is good, and in the other of what is true, in order that what is an object for consciousness should contain no other ingredient whatever except the Notion which is the essence. ButheretheNotion as an abstraction cuts itself off from the multiplicity of things, and thus has noconten tin its own selfbutone thatis. given to it.* [Hegel Phenomenology of Spirit.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/25NBYKQR?page=158&amp;annotation=UDFDK3P3)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*is present, being and operation* [03.b. en (gpt) _ deuxiÃ¨me chapitre_ troisiÃ¨me partie [Serres, Michael_Le systÃ¨me de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9G4QDC2Y?page=23&amp;annotation=DGHAUHHX)&quot;</li>
