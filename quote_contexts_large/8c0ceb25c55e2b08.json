As I write, the text editor's output is constantly being shaped by the ambient sounds, smells, and visual stimuli that surround me, much like the way a painter's brushstrokes are influenced by the texture and color of the canvas. The text editor's ability to capture and process this information allows for a new form of writing that is no longer confined to the page, but is instead a dynamic and immersive experience that blurs the boundaries between the digital and the physical.", "suggest_context": "This chapter will describe how this model is constructed and how other modes can be used to establish other biases, which will be demonstrated in the writing of chapter 4. - The purpose of the text editor is manyfold. It is to make the writing of the thesis its own experiment, because if proposing a different way of writing then what better way to demonstrate that in the writing itself? Furthermore it is to form a manner in which the transitions between image and text constant, and volatile while the method stabilises through the demonstration of its use throughout an extensive document. The other aspect is to take the coded out of the coding environment as this is the only way to domesticate its use, for as long as we're engaging with the information in a coded way we are inevitably bound to be engaging with it through the thought of it's higher level structure. Of course this is essential, and therefore this process will be outlined in detail throughout this chapter, however in order to domesticate the information within a non coding activity it has to become intuitive and constant, in the same way that the 3D models on the shelves are present in the studio of OMA the images and texts have to be present constantly, effortlessly, and quickly in order to interwine themselves with the process of writing as is. To refer back to the new materiality discussed earlier, the ambition here is to start getting a sense for these pieces of information, and to combine and sculpt them into the synthetic process of writing by incorporating their characteristics within these new contexts. This is also in line with the ambition to move beyond the attitude of set based approaches, but instead trying to emulate an algebraic manner of forming equations, therefore maintaining the presence of both domains at all times. Perhaps the most important shift this entails is in learning to cope with a certain notion of indeterminateness and cyclicity that is immanent to materiality itself, and within which chance factors as an objective, formally determinative aspect. Bhlmann, 2021, p. 35 pdf Nice addition to the Katie Lloyd Thomas argument - As Buhlmann extends on this topic of materiality, it is important to note that the text editors findings are always contingent and susceptible to entropy. The data is found through probabilistic findings, and therefore never purports to be of any truth, it is only there as a piece of information that through this process has shown a resonance with that which is being written. And secondary to this, the choices which are then finally made are personal. They are my preference and ideas of what is of appropriate proportion to what I am writing. The context from which these choices are being made are constantly available through links, therefore providing a means of insight in both the nature of projection that the editor facilitates, as well as the choices I have mode from amongst these contexts."}
