Spatial elements will represent the geographical or physical location of the data, while temporal elements will represent the time period in which the data was gathered. Categorical elements will represent the specific attributes or characteristics of the data, such as the type of data or the domain it belongs to. These elements will be used to create the indexing system that allows for efficient retrieval of the data.", "suggest_context": "3.3 ELEMENTALS Now that we've established the material we'll be using, this chapter will discuss the ways in which the contents are managed into their subsequent elements. These elements are what will act as the indices by which we will compute the projections and searches within and across the domains. We shall therefore here outline how these elements will act as symbolic representations for their domains, and how this representation is achieved through different ways of encoding the information."}
