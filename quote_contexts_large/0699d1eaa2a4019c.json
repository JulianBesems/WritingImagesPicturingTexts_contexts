These screens are constructed by using the SOMs to cluster the data into a two-dimensional map. The SOMs are used to find patterns in the data and represent it in a way that is easy to understand and visualize. This allows the user to navigate through the data in a more intuitive way.", "suggest_context": "3.4 CONSTRUCTING THE 'SCREENS' This chapter is how to start establishing the screens, between which the different projections are cast. The screens are constructed through the technology of SOMs or the navigation through the whole of the data in the manner of a dataset query. We use the term screen because it is constrctued to facilitate the casting of a projection on a full domain of information, in principle to address a particular character of the way in which the projection is to be constructed. In total there are 4 primary 'screens', the two generic ones of books and images, and the two personal ones of the multi-modal text-words and figurative-words. Of these four 3 are represented through the method of Self Organising Maps, except for the generic image which relies on a database structure only."}
