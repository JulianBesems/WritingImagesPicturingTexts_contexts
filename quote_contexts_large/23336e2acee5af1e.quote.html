    <pre>4.1.1 FLOOR . . the floor. Thats right. The floor. Its typically the largest horizontal surface in the room and undeniably the most used. The floor is a site of the body in extremis. In tragic history plays and epics, at the point of climax, characters must keel over or fall over backwards onto the floor. In making object form, the floor is a medium of active forms that organize interplay and interdependence with spatial consequence. Floor coverings If floor coverings are to be used, a person must choose between carpeting, area rugs, or hard coverings, known as resilient floors. Carpeting helps unify the entire room. We identify ourselves with this space, this place, this moment and these dimensions become ingredients of our very existence. Architecture is the art of reconciliation between ourselves and the world, and this mediation takes place through the senses. All the materials discussed so far have characteristics which make them obviously suitable for use in structures, including staircases. The same cannot be said of glass.

<em>In particular, glass is a material that resists being used as a floor covering, as it does not provide the necessary support or traction. However, it can be used in structural elements, such as windows or doors, which can still be aesthetically pleasing while providing functionality. This highlights the importance of considering the specific properties of a material when designing a structure.  The floor, in this sense, is a surface that demands a certain level of functionality and usability.  It must be able to support the weight of people, furniture, and objects, while also providing a sense of comfort and well-being.  In this way, the floor is a fundamental aspect of architecture, as it plays a crucial role in defining the spatial experience of a building or room.  The way the floor is designed and constructed can have a significant impact on the overall feel and functionality of a space.  It can also influence the way people move through and interact with the space, shaping their experiences and perceptions of the environment.  In short, the floor is a vital component of any architectural design, and its importance cannot be overstated.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Glass has become invisible. Thus, the inherent properties of glass, along with its technical capabilities, allow designers to choose the degree of material presence of glass.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;82 The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture Glass can “reﬂect, bend, transmit, and absorb light” (Bell 2006: 14). Manipulating these inherent characteristics of reﬂectance, transmittance and absorbency alters the experience of light through glass.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Glass 520 All the materials discussed so far have characteristics which make them obviously suitable for use in structures, including staircases. The same cannot be said of glass.&quot;[Campbell, James W. P., and Michael Tutton *Staircases: History, Repair and Conservation*. Routledge, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Architecture’s endless quest for ‘transparent’ buildings can simply mean excessive use of glass. This then requires ingenious design to solve problems created by the designer.&quot;[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Chapter 6 Glass The use of glass as a material for buildings exploded in the twentieth century due to many technical improvements making it less costly to manufacture and safer to use, and, as a result, no material has a greater correlation to the architecture of the modern movement.&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*.

<li>&quot;floor&quot; to prompt or indulge a spectrum of behaviors is perhaps another underexploited power  worth retrieving from a study of architectural elements. section A historical fast-forward through the changing cross-section of the floor would remain steady on  hardened earth for centuries, eventually incorporating aggregates of stone and wooden timbers.&quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;. . the floor. That’s right. The floor. It’s typically the largest horizontal surface in the room and undeniably the most used. It’s important to choose flooring that fits your taste, lifestyle, and budget.&quot;[Farris, Jerri *Kitchens &amp; Baths for Today &amp; Tomorrow  Ideas for Fabulous New Kitchens and Baths*. Cool Springs Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;In floor construction columns help to support beams and girders when floor joists are used over long span. Beams are long horizontal pieces of squared timber or steel supported at both ends used to carry the weight of a building.&quot;[Г.И., Железнякова *Civil Engineering Часть 1*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;structural glass A glass which is cast in the form of cubes, rectangular blocks, tile, or large rectangular plates; used widely for the surfacing of walls.&quot;[Ernest., Burden *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The use of glass imposes new solutions … I discovered by working with actual glass models that the important thing is the play of reflections, and not the effect of light and shadow as in ordinary buildings.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;floating floor The floor is separated from the rest of the building by supporting it on sleepers or a built-up structural system, to provide sound insulation or space for high-tech flexible electrical service, independent of wall locations.&quot;[Ernest., Burden *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Floor coverings If floor coverings are to be used, a person must choose between carpeting, area rugs, or hard coverings, known as resilient floors. Carpeting helps unify the entire room.&quot;[Н.М., Філіппова, and Смуглякова М.К. *Focus on Design. Part Two. Interior Design*. 2017.]</li>

<li>&quot;523 524 7. 12 Composite glass and stainless steel staircase, Apple Store, Glasgow. (Michael Tutton) If a stair structure is to be clad in material that is stiffer than the stair itself, the detailing of the cladding needs to include joints that will allow structural deflections to occur without loading up the cladding.&quot;[Campbell, James W.
