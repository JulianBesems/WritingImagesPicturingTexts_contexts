    <pre>Together they operate orthogonally shared measures, different information so that the operation between them is proportion rather than translation. The two PUBLIC screens can also be seen as the observational substrate, while the PRIVATE screens act as the projective instruments through which the different observations are refracted onto a spectrum of observations of the other public screen - more like a prism than a mirror. 3.4.1 INFORMATIONAL SCREENS Screens provide a constructed field for projection: a low-dimensional, addressable surface that lets a whole domain be handled at once. Not a picture, but an instrument, like the silver screen in a cinema is a host for the film projector. &quot;The point-by-point correspondence of the solid volume and its delineation, ichnography or scenography, makes the latter a characteristic or a language; conversely, language establishes a correspondence of the same type as the painting - one then understands the deformations and avatars of the former, if one observes that the projection can be made on a left surface, or &#x27;humpbacked&#x27;&quot; - Serres, Le systme de Leibniz et ses modles mathmatiques Our screens align with the projection surface Serres describes in his discussion on the way Leibniz achieves a formal analysis of representation, designed to keep correspondences legible under changes of projection surface. It fixes indices what can be addressed, supplies a compact metric how things can touch, and offers a plane where proportions can be cast without collapsing modalities into translation. In the PUBLIC screens books, images the surface remains generic and tends towards observation. In the PRIVATE screens multimodal text-words, figurative-words the surface is biased on purpose, an authored cast that curates attention. Together they coexist without collapse: shared dimensionality, different information. This coexistence is further grounded in Serres framing of Leibniz universal language: &quot;There are, therefore, two orders, the order of reasons and the order of images, but these orders are multiple.&quot;. Distinct orders, still able to communicate via projection. The screen is where that projection becomes operable: public surfaces make private biases legible; private casts turn the public surface into a playground. Placed within WIPTe the Self-Organising Map becomes a way to constitute an alphabet of a domain rather than to represent it. Roman puts it concisely: &quot;A SOM provides a context for articulating a kind of genericness&quot;, a way to encode potentials on a generic plane without explicating what they are. Kohonens own description tells us why this suits our use: The SOM model may not be a replica of any input item but only a local average over a subset of items that are most similar to it, which makes it a compact, query-time-light substrate for projecting and re-projecting. In this sense the screen functions as a generic machine for alphabets: it lets domains speak in their own terms, and then enables us to read them architectonically via casts.

<em>The SOM&#x27;s genericness allows it to bridge the gap between the public and private screens, as it can project and re-project the biases and observations across the different surfaces. This enables the constitution of a common ground, a shared dimensionality, for the different modalities to interact and communicate. The SOM&#x27;s ability to average over subsets of items also means that it can handle the complex relationships between the different modalities, and project them onto a common plane where they can be read and understood. In this way, the SOM becomes a key instrument in the construction of the alphabets of the different domains, allowing us to articulate their genericness and encode their potentials.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;My analyses also makes apparent the two other dimensions of Saxe’s (2002) analytic framework—sociogenesis, concerned with appropriation and spread of cultural forms, and ontogenesis, the shifting relations between form and function of cultural artifacts—though it does so in a different way. Despite ample evidence that children make reference to each other’s contributions (e. g. , “the square that Connor said”), more important appears to be the emergence of the classification as a cultural artifact.&quot;[Roth, Wolff-Michael *Geometry as Objective Science in Elementary School Classrooms: Mathematics in the Flesh*.

<li>&quot;This is why I propose that we understand the generic in the ﬁrst way rather than the second. This reasoning generalizes to ‘p things k in way w’. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 22/2/2018, SPi  THE MECHANISM Here is another way to make the point. Suppose that there is such a thing as the way that Americans look and such a thing as the way that Canadians look and that these two ways are the same. Call this way ‘w’.&quot;[Breckenridge, Wylie *Visual Experience: A Semantic Approach*. Oxford University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;There are many ways of saying the same thing, and many different things communicated in every sentence. For a machine to process the full range of human language, it must “understand” and react appropriately to a huge variety of potential expression. Many promising techniques are being developed using both manual and automated analysis of language, including statistical studies of massive data sets drawn from the Web. The intersection of language and knowledge is an area that we have great interest in and are actively pursuing in Project Halo, dealing with the full range of linguistic expression.&quot;[Allen., Paul *Idea man : a memoir by the cofounder of Microsoft*.

<li>&quot;The mind thus becomes aware of sets of similar differences, and forms series of terms with the same kind and amount of difference between them, terms which, as they succeed each other, maintain a constant direction of serial increase. This sense of constant direction in a series of operations we saw in Chapter XIII (p. 490) to be a cardinal mental fact. &quot;A differs from B differs from C differs from D, etc. ,&quot; makes a series only when the differences are in the same direction. In any such difference-series all terms differ in just the same way from their predecessors.&quot;[James, William *Principles of Psychology*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;At the same time, the ﬁgure for great sense of self has hardly changed, and that for great sense of community has actually doubled. Nonetheless, the prediction based on qualitative semantic analysis is supported by both sets of ﬁgures: they both show that the ﬁgures for great sense of community are, as predicted, much higher than those for great sense of self (in 2007, ten times higher, and in 2008, thirty times higher).&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*.

<li>&quot;It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to understand one another: we must also em- Purchase the entire Coradella Collegiate Bookshelf on CD at http://collegebookshelf. net 239 ploy the same words for the same kind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN COMMON. On this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations, even when they use the same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there ORIGINATES therefrom an entity that “understands itself ”—namely, a nation.&quot;[Nietzsche Friedrich, coradella *Beyond Good and Evil*. 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;And these differ from one another in the aforementioned way. Therefore, in a way [the starting-points] they mention are the same, and [in a way] different. Certainly it would seem to most people that they are different, but they are the same [189a] in that they are analogous. For they take contraries from the same column,4 some of them wider in extent and some narrower. So in this way their accounts are both the same and different, some better and some worse, and some [posit contraries] better known by definition, as we mentioned [5] before, and others [posit contraries] better known by perception.&quot;[Cohen, S. Marc, Patricia Curd, and C.D.C. Reeve *Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy: From Thales to Aristotle*. 5th. Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Whether described as classification, indexing, categorisation or taxonomy, the typological effort essentially constitutes grouping similar things together in a way that is meant to be helpful. The helpfulness of types can be expressed in different ways by different architects. A prized benefit is the legacy of rationality. The systemic reasoning behind the emergence of a type replicates a scientific approach; it conveys that an underlying strict logic is controlling a discipline that might at times appear incoherent and out of control.&quot;[Jacoby, Sam, and Christopher Lee *Typological Urbanism: Projective Cities (Architectural Design January February 2011, Vol. 81, No. 1)*.

<li>&quot;(Here and in the rest of this section I draw upon the very helpful discussion in Tye (1984), pp. 207–9. )According to Conjunction, someone can have a visual experience that is occurring in way wg and a visual experience that is occurring in way ws without having a visual experience that is occurring in way wgs, because in such cases she has two simultaneous visual experiences—one that is occurring in way wg and one that is occurring in way ws. This is plausible only if in such cases there are two things involved that we can use to individuate the visual experiences in a principled way.&quot;[Breckenridge, Wylie *Visual Experience: A Semantic Approach*.

<li>&quot;Aristotle already has established that the common term, or common attribute, the medical, is non-synonymous insofar as he has shown that there are different uses of the term: “medical” does not signify the same character or quality when it is used in reference to an instrument, an 22 The slippage from medical art in Meta. to medical man in EE as the primary thing can be explained by the fact that the medical person and the medical art are the same with respect to having the same form; both serve as primary instances insofar as medicine and the medical person are intrinsic denominations of the medical in Cajetan’s sense.&quot;[Ward, Julie K. *Aristotle on Homonymy: Dialectic and Science*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The relevance of the public/private dimension to great sense is also supported by the marked contrast in results obtained for great sense of community (common) and great sense of self (rare). Here, the difference in proportions is staggering (see table 6. 15): TABLE 6. 15. sense of community great sense of community sense of self great sense of self 1,500,000 114,000 1,500,000 11,400 As we have seen in the section on sense of self, this phrase, too, can readily take some modiﬁers, especially strong.&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*.

<li>&quot;that e. g. a particular (in the sense of &#x27;specific&#x27;) shade of knowledge or a particular bit of linguistic knowledge cannot be present in more than one individual. In the latter cases we are dealing, not with particulars in the strict sense of the word, but with infimae species. One specific shade of pink may be present in (A) as well as in (B), but at the same time (A)&#x27;s particular pink and (B)&#x27;s particular pink are-though specifically identicalnumerically different. It is only in the latter (numerical) sense of the words &#x27;the same&#x27; (identical)-and in the corresponding strict sense of &#x27;particular&#x27; -that different subjects indeed cannot share the same (identical) particular property.&quot;[Algra, Keimpe *Concepts of space in Greek thought*. Brill, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;Such quantitative corroboration is not necessary to validate the qualitative semantic analysis but is nonetheless extremely interesting and valuable. In any case, the prevailing overall consistency of the numerical results requires an explanation. 10. 3. Stable and Overwhelmingly Sharp Contrasts In many cases, predictions based on semantic analysis are corroborated by extremely sharp numerical contrasts that have proved stable over time. For example, in May 2007 the results for deep sense of shame and deep sense of sadness were many thousands of times higher than those for clear sense of shame and clear sense of sadness, and the same proved to be the case when the search was repeated in March 2008 (table 10. 4).&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*.
