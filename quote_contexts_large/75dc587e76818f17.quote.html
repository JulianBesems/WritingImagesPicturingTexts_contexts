This last chapter is intended to sum up the findings in a short format by revisiting the main problem and the hypotheses with their respective research questions as they were formulated in the Introduction and in Part I (‘System’). A final paragraph touches upon the issue of further development perspectives and the need for future research.&quot;[Vibæk, Kasper Sánchez *Architectural System Structures: Integrating Design Complexity in Industrialised Construction*.

<li>&quot;the dichotomy of opposing renderings which is to explain humour. As stated before in the paper, the mere incongruity is not the ideal explication behind the comic. What is therefore a must is a further study into the nature of Summary of humour analysis and conclusions 209 such incompatibility. It would be profitable to establish the restrictions on this, for instance the type of incongruity or opposition that creates humour. Hence, further research must focus its attention on this issue.&quot;[Jabłońska-Hood, Joanna *A Conceptual Blending Theory of Humour: Selected British Comedy Productions in Focus*.

Empirical Convergence and Ampliative Reasoning Peirce asked how a concept, proposition, or argument could achieve empirical reality and suggested that the Cartesian single-chain mode of deductive reasoning, used by modern logic, be replaced by the multifilament cable mode of ampliative reasoning, for his postmodern logic.&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*.

<li>&quot;Hence there is an urgent need to reformulate the optimality principles, or simple limit them even further, and this again is a task for research in future. Summary of humour analysis and conclusions 211 It is also important to look back at the material analysed in order to decide whether humour explained by means of CIT is always based on metaphor and metonymy as such. The conclusion that must be drawn is that there are no humorous examples in chapter 3 that would hinge their input relations on either metaphor or metonymy.&quot;[Jabłońska-Hood, Joanna *A Conceptual Blending Theory of Humour: Selected British Comedy Productions in Focus*.

<li>&quot;The ﬁrst hypothesis states that, as the complexity of social groupings and functions contained within the home has reduced over time, the fractal dimensions of plans and elevations should decrease to reflect this change. In the chronological analysis of the results some evidence to support this position was presented, with trendlines recording a gradual reduction in complexity of both plans and elevations over time. However, the least emphatic of these results was the one for plans without roofs, the very data set which might have been expected to reveal this answer most clearly.&quot;[Ostwald, Michael J., and Josephine Vaughan (auth.) *The Fractal Dimension of Architecture*.

<li>&quot;2. 8 Conclusion and Future Perspectives In this chapter, we described a process model for concept invention that is based on and extends the conceptual blending theory of Fauconnier and Turner (2002). According to this process, concept invention is characterised by different subprocesses—discovery, blending, and evaluation—that together account for concept invention. Apart from the blending mechanism modelling the creation of new concepts, we focused on two extra dimensions that are typically not addressed in computational approaches of concept blending.&quot;[Confalonieri, Roberto, Alison Pease, Marco Schorlemmer, Tarek R.

<li>&quot;18 19 160 C. Pearson Thus, applying this to our present discussion, with each new law subsumed, the USST converges to the most powerful explanation available in all of semiotics. The Semantics of Perception Many interesting theories, explanations, and solutions to important problems had to be left out of our discussions for lack of space. I have arrived at the conclusion that every semantic problem of interest can be solved using the USST. One theory that I deliberately left out was Peirce’s philosophical theory of perception.&quot;[(eds.), Peter Pericles Trifonas *International Handbook of Semiotics*. Springer Netherlands, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;The regions resulting from both settings are assembled to stage a scenography alongside the writing; not illustrations of it, but a backdrop and context. In practice, the prose navigates one textual field while, orthogonally, a visual field unfolds. This is our instrumented way of involving multiple domains while maintaining their differences. Serres, reading Leibniz, describes such contrapuntal analysis: “Generally, the analysis is spun in such a way that several areas are involved at the same time: it is by this contrapuntal style that one recognises the 234 &quot;[INPUT: content_small.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;This is the direction of reasoning in reverse engineering. We just assume that the architecture exists and proceed to analyze it. Learning analysis first creates the conditions for successful synthesis. Chapter 7 adopts a forward engineering approach, examining how systems derive from a solution-neutral statement of function and arrive at a concept. Finally, in Chapter 8, we demonstrate how this concept flows to an architecture. References [1] K. T. Ulrich and S. D.

<li>&quot;This initial chapter sets the scene for much that follows. Chapter 2, by John Bissell, moves from the wide-ranging to the highly specific: a variety of approaches in science and technology based on the notions of dimensional analysis and dimensional reasoning. Like many of the themes of this book, the dimensional approach is one which is of enormous utility for scientific and technological practice, but one which finds only a minor place in the professional education of scientists and engineers.&quot;[(auth.), John Monk, Chris Bissell, and Chris Dillon (eds.) *Ways of Thinking, Ways of Seeing: Mathematical and other Modelling in Engineering and Technology*.

<li>&quot;This means that we maintain the tree-like hierarchical organisation of the RST analysis by specifying and refining just what it means for elements to be the ‘same’ or not. Finally, the fourth problematic area for a multimodal RST concerns the entire notion of what a multimodal rhetorical analysis can adopt as its minimal unit of analysis. Whereas for text analysis spans are generally restricted to clause or clause-like phrases, rhetorical relations holding across distinct semiotic modes open up several further significant possibilities, that we now describe.&quot;[Bateman, John *Analysing Multimodal Documents: A Foundation for the Systematic Analysis of Multimodal Documents*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;CONCLUSION the related chapter. Distance measures, dichotomic trees, and the evolution model implicit in some of the statistical inference techniques have to be evaluated and reviewed in this particular context. We believe that there is an intrinsic value in this approach and debate, and in this line of questioning. In a coherent analysis framework that produces global results from individual observations, any confirmation or surprise is a valuable contribution to the refinement and systematic correction of our own perspectives and assumptions.&quot;[Guimaraes, Nuno, and Luis Carrico? *Hypermedia Genes: An Evolutionary Perspective on Concepts, Models, and Architectures (Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts Retrieval and Services)*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;This has, as Weiberg suggests, deeply temporal implications. Using examples by Marcel Duchamp and Roland Barthes, in my own chapter, “Transpositionality and Artistic Research,” I propose to understand transpos14 Introduction itions as differential constructs that may but need not “decay” into representation, that is, conventional forms of knowledge. In fact, I argue that certain types of art and artistic research tend towards a continuing suspension of representation proposing new and more complex epistemic objects that, while exceeding conceptual understanding, can still be grasped aesthetically through further transpositions.&quot;[Schwab, Michael *Transpositions: Aesthetico-Epistemic Operators in Artistic Research*. Leuven University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;[] Thus there is a tension between too broad and too narrow a definition of genre. ” (Yates and Orlikowski 1992, p305) We do not accept this tension at all; the situation is actually the same for any linguistic analysis. The question is simply one of how fine an analysis needs to be for a specific analytic purpose. This decision should rest with the analyst and not be imposed a priori by the framework: the framework employed should be able to support analytical resolution of any granularity that is appropriate for the kinds of research questions raised.&quot;[Bateman, John *Analysing Multimodal Documents: A Foundation for the Systematic Analysis of Multimodal Documents*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The production of a coherent theory of drawings requires that we abandon the idea that one can distinguish between artistic and nonartistic productions. Hierarchies and judgmentsof merit must be abandoned because attempts to distinguish between “worthy” and “unworthy” works ultimately prevents us from understanding crucial relationships between different works. The second issue is that of generating a rigorous taxonomy of drawings, which I attempted to create in chapter 10 in a very general sense, but which needs a much more detailed analysis, before it can become a useful tool for understanding graphics.&quot;[Massironi, Manfredo, and Translated by N Bruno *The Psychology of Graphic Images: Seeing, Drawing, Communicating (Volume in the University of Alberta, Department of Psychology, Distinguished Scholar Lecture)*. 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;Where should we draw the line?Later in this chapter, we will illustrate a quantitative analysis by which we can prune downstream stakeholders if the impact diminishes, but the reality is that this depth of analysis is challenging to undertake (indeed, there is substantial discussion on measuring the multiplier effect).&quot;[Cameron, Bruce, Edward Crawley, and Daniel Selva *Systems Architecture.

<li>&quot;By enveloping the reader’s gaze ﬁrst in grim darkness and then in comparable luminosity, the shift from gloom to brightness crowds the peripheral vision, and is felt as much as comprehended. This chapter has striven to conduct a formal analysis that concentrates on these texts’ pictorial styles alone.&quot;[Miodrag, Hannah *Comics and Language: Reimagining Critical Discourse on the Form*.

<li>&quot;)8 2c (programmatically) Let us defer this until after the next ‘geometric’ section, and only remark that ﬁnite-element analysis only gives a barometric reading of the actual stress, and no hint as to the path of force nor the tendency of collapse. With the spectre of the ‘hanging-chain’ model9 still hanging in our by-now fusty nineteenth-century imagination (i. e. with no better real-time form/force generative tool despite computation!), we envisaged a real-time spring-based engineering applet that might add a formative potency to our emergent Sinthome, possible only via the excessive computational proclivity of digital machines .&quot;[Goulthorpe, Mark *The Possibility of (an) Architecture: Selected Essays by Mark Goulthorpe dECOi*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;In his analysis of Husserl’s The Origin of Geometry, Derrida invokes Ricoeur’s analysis of Husserl to note that the root of this contrariness lies in the distinction, and clear but tense relationship, between intention and intuition [Derrida 1978: 140, n. 167]. Intuition operates without intention. However, its own grasping ghosts the very same serial mode of encounter and relaying of significance that is hoped for by the methods of fulfilling intention. 4 That is to say, the instrumentality of intention more often than not requires a series of moves to convey such intent; this is akin to intuition in that it too operates by grasping things in series.&quot;[(auth.), Robert Kirkbride, and Robert Kirkbride (eds.) *Geometries of Rhetoric*.
