Rather than treating this gap as a technical flaw to be overcome, it is reframed as a conceptual opportunity. Drawing from Simondon\u2019s notion of transduction, Foucault\u2019s analysis of Magritte\u2019s pipe, and the epistemic logic of architectural modalities, the multimodal gap is approached as a productive obstacle for speculation."}
