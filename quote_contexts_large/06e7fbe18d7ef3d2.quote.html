    <pre>This proposes a non-linear model that facilitates the communication between domains, maintaining a proportionality. Focussed on facilitating an understanding. These associations are approached as invitations into conversation. As stated by Valry, as soon as we make a comparison it is not moving and we are not entering the relation between the objects. Comparison communicates through distance, difference, and proximity; it tends to stabilise. Instead of focussing only on what is close and similar, the scope here is to explore a means of association that forms constellations, what Ishigami calls an approachable abstraction. These constellations are treated as indefinite and ambiguous clusters of things that might engage in talks, much like the Kunstkammer as discussed by Horst Bredekamp. Within this context, machine learning ML is approached less as an means of classification or generation, and more as a family of techniques that enable projections within domains and between domains. Examples range from self-organising maps SOM to contemporary textimage systems. Although these projections rest on encoding domains into vectors between which distances can be measured the relations they establish do not behave like a single explicit function that can be written down in advance. Using ML methods, the projection from a domain to a co-domain follows contingent relations established through associations of data. Removing a strictly linear connection between domain and co-domain has the potential to lift the resulting architectonic connection out of geometry onto a communication between non-commensurable fields. This does not mean abandoning geometry; rather it means resisting its monopolisation. It will rely on discerning proportionalities between domains instead of translating them into the same common set, comparable to the proportion between plan and section. These domains in architecture are not the same, nor can they be reduced to one field; they need to stand orthogonal to each other to bear meaning. Within that scope, we treat ML as a non-systematic means of orienting qualitative data: facilitating projections within and between domains that do not follow a pre-declared mathematical function, and thereby tuning indefinite and ambiguous constellations of communication. At the same time, the scope of the thesis is explicitly instrumental rather than model-inventive. Current ML developments have culminated in models that can transform input data to related information, both between domains e.g. text to image and within domains e.g. text to text. These developments are of evident relevance here because they enable continuous interaction. Because of the high complexity, requirement of resources, and the reliance on enormous scale of data of such models, the thesis does not attempt to extend their computational architectures, nor retrain them; instead it focuses on using and connecting existing technologies, using small scale datasets to curate particular kinds of interactions. Their original setup is used, connected, and probed in ways that support the thesiss architectonic propositions about projection, proportion, and heterogeneity. Their rapid evolution is therefore addressed as context and constraint: it informs what can be staged, but does not determine what counts as an architectural outcome.

<em>These connections, in turn, are understood as invitations to explore the tensions between the domains, which are not necessarily compatible with the existing infrastructure. By embracing this complexity, the thesis proposes a new architectural paradigm that redefines the relationship between the domains and the infrastructure, allowing for novel forms of communication and interaction to emerge. This is achieved by using ML methods to project the domains onto each other, creating a constellation of connections that transcend the boundaries between them. The resulting architectonic connection is no longer based on a single explicit function, but rather on the emergent properties of the connections themselves. In this way, the thesis challenges the dominant paradigm of infrastructure as a fixed and predetermined system, and instead proposes a more dynamic and adaptive approach that is capable of responding to the changing needs of the domains. The focus is on creating a space for dialogue and collaboration, where the domains can engage with each other in a way that is both meaningful and productive.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;Such structure yields complexity beyond that typically shown in co-speech gestures or the binding of text with individual images (Cohn, 2013a). This work seeks to characterize such complex multimodal interactions by expanding on Jackendoff’s (2002) parallel architecture for language. Here, focus will be placed on how grammar and meaning coalesce in multimodal interactions, extending beyond the semantic taxonomies typically discussed about text–image relations (e. g. , Kress, 2009; Martinec &amp; Salway, 2005; McCloud, 1993; Royce, 2007).&quot;[INPUT: Cohn - 2016 - A multimodal parallel architecture A cognitive framework for multimodal interactions.pdf]</li>

To this point, this overall parallel architecture emphasizes both the structures involved in behaviors, but also the interfaces linking these structures. This is especially important when considering development, both for monomodal and multimodal information, since fluency in a structure requires an interface between structures, not just the structure itself.&quot;[INPUT: Cohn - 2016 - A multimodal parallel architecture A cognitive framework for multimodal interactions.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;This approach can instead involve “metaphorizing” the literal sentences in the relevant discourse segment: translating the information in them into sourcedomain terms. We present this possibility as a potentially fruitful topic for future research into metaphor. Conclusion AI is not just about the engineering of “intelligent” artefacts for useful purposes but also about mapping out the space of possible principles and mechanisms of cognition, whether artificial or natural.&quot;[Jr., Raymond W. Gibbs *The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought*. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;AI is in a peculiar position to add both to the appreciation of the variety and complexity of metaphor as it arises in practical discourse and to the question of how to process real metaphor in practical contexts, because of the inclusion within AI of applications-oriented research. One of the AI systems reviewed above (MIDAS, by James Martin) concentrated on metaphor arising in question-and-answer sessions between users and an automated Unix help system.&quot;[Jr., Raymond W. Gibbs *The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought*. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The topic of the main Section 2 is a discussion of ontological and methodological aspects of contrastive information structure analysis. Section 2 also contains some relativising remarks on the ideal methodological requirements on contrastive information structure analysis as discussed before. The point here is that keeping this ideal in mind and explaining in how far a prospective instance of contrastive information structure analysis matches it is more fruitful than not undertaking the analysis in the first place just because it may be impossible to heed the ideal completely.&quot;[Breul, Carsten, and Edward Göbbel *Comparative and Contrastive Studies of Information Structure*. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;This notion can be extended to many text–image relations as well (Cohn, 2013a), where bundled text and image form a coherent message within a single panel that progresses to subsequent units (e. g. , McCloud, 1993). In both cases, modalities may make a semantic correspondence in relating to common conceptual information (McNeill, 1992), but the visual-graphic domain does not use temporal correspondence as in co-speech gesture (i. e. , association from occurring at the same time) unless it is produced in real time interactions (e. g. , Green, 2014).&quot;[INPUT: Cohn - 2016 - A multimodal parallel architecture A cognitive framework for multimodal interactions.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;The VERL approach does not refer to large–scale domain ontologies or to acknowledged patterns to provide a structure to the event models. Ballan et al. use the hierarchical linguistic relations over lexical entries encoded in WordNet to learn and refine rules that detect complex events from simple ones [3]. An ontology-based approach to the detection and annotation of events is video is pursued also by the 116 M. Cataldi et al. Mind’s Eye project [10]. In this work, the events detected in video are described as “verbs”, described in terms of a spatial model of motion.&quot;[Oltramari, Alessandro, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin (auth.), Alessandro Oltramari, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin, and Eduard Hovy (eds.) *New Trends of Research in Ontologies and Lexical Resources: Ideas, Projects, Systems*.

<li>&quot;In the desired framework, visual intelligent systems should be able to reconstruct a “story” from basic information, blending relevant visual data with common-sense knowledge into a unifying conceptual pattern. Adopting an architectural perspective, implementing this capability would require three different strata of information elaboration: basic optical features (low-level), object detection (mid-level) and event classification (high-level). In this contribution we focus on high-level mechanisms and contents, namely the core visual intelligence as opposed to state-of-the-art machine vision.&quot;[Oltramari, Alessandro, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin (auth.), Alessandro Oltramari, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin, and Eduard Hovy (eds.) *New Trends of Research in Ontologies and Lexical Resources: Ideas, Projects, Systems*.

<li>&quot;The compositional structure claimed for SF is very much in line with the proposals of lackendoff (1983, 1987, and chapter I, this volume) about conceptual structure (CS), with one important difference, however, which has consequences for the relation of language and space. The problem is this. Although what lackendoff calls &quot;lexical conceptual structure&quot; (LCS) is-details aside-very close in spirit to the SF information SF(le) of lexical items, he explicitly claims that conceptual structure (CS; and hence LCS) is an extralinguistic level of representation.&quot;[P., Bloom, Peterson M.A., Nadel L., and Garret M.F. (eds.) *Language and Space*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, another basic concept in CA, i. e. social action, has not been fully addressed. An account of linguistic features of turn design may provide us with a point of departure to explore how social actions are formed through different turn designs. Curl and Drew’s (2008) illuminating research shows that the two different forms of syntactic structures (i. e. “Can you…?” and “I wonder if…?”) form two types of requesting actions in different contexts. Drew (2010) also addresses ascription of action through analyzing the linguistic design of turns.&quot;[Li, Xiaoting *Multimodality, Interaction and Turn-taking in Mandarin Conversation*. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;By analogy with O’Halloran’s (1999) semiotic metaphor, we propose to analyze the motivated patterning across modes in terms of “semiotic foregrounding. ” As far as the analysis in this chapter is concerned, this means that the level of multimodal symbolic articulation has to take account of three types of foregrounding: verbal foregrounding, visual foregrounding, and semiotic foregrounding.&quot;[Webster, Jonathan J., and Xuanwei Peng (eds.) *Applying Systemic Functional Linguistics: The State of the Art in China Today*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;The uses illustrated above exploit the cognitive association between a change o f physical orientation (through rotation) and a change of state. By contrast, an example such as T he talk turned to fo o d derives from the notion of trajectory change (the talk did not turn into food but changed direction). There are two metaphors at work here. The underlying metaphor, ‘Conversation is a journey’, is a prerequisite for the superimposed metaphor of change of topic as change of direction.&quot;[David., Lee *Cognitive linguistics: an introduction*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Then, we gave an introduction to the pdtb browser, which gives access to discourse relation annotation of the Penn Discourse Treebank. Finally, we rounded off the chapter by providing an overview of Annis, a multi-purpose search and visualization tool that captures syntactic annotation as well as coreference and discourse annotation. 270 9781441164476_txt_print. indd 270 02/10/2014 09:41 Searching for Semantic and Discourse Phenomena 13. 5â•‡ Further Reading Section 13. 1 Frame Index: The index of semantic frames is accessible at https://framenet. icsi. berkeley.&quot;[Kuebler, Sandra, and Heike Zinsmeister *Corpus Linguistics and Linguistically Annotated Corpora*. annotated edition.

<li>&quot;In this respect, accessibility theory resembles recent attempts to reduce some anaphora phenomena to pragmatic principles, such as Reinhart (1983), Kempson (1984), Levinson (1987, 1991), Huang {1994), Gundel et al. (1993), and Ward et al. (1991). One Accessibility theory could then suggest that accessibility theory should be formulated as a set of extralinguistic inferences, connecting between linguistic forms and proper contexts on the basis of common sense inferences from their semantic meanings, rather than based on conventional form-function correlations (see Reboul 1997; Bach 1998).&quot;[Sanders, Ted, Joost Schilperoord, and Wilbert Spooren *Text representation: linguistic and psycholinguistic aspects*.
