{"created_at": 1763140904.493584, "confirmed": true, "origin": "searched", "search_input": "", "suggested_query": "This epistemic upheaval resonates with the endeavour of WIPT, which endeavours to expose precise contexts from a vast amount of writing, while acknowledging the heterogeneity of the dataset. As such, the WIPT instrument is designed to navigate the abundance of texts, rather than to impose any particular norms or standards. This approach is exemplified in the construction of Chicago-style endnote references, which allows for the coexistence of reliable and problematic information. The instrument's ability to resonate with diverse texts, including those that may fundamentally disagree or be highly problematic, enables it to engage with the dataset in a nuanced and context-dependent manner. By doing so, WIPT can uncover new insights and perspectives that might be overlooked by more traditional methods of analysis.", "suggest_context": "The intention is not to read these documents in a conventional matter nor to retrieve them in full. Instead we are interested in creating a digital substrate, and normalising the data format is the first step that facilitates the operability of this TEXT domain. That said, at this stage the texts do remain in legible form, no lemmatisation, segmentation or filtering is applied. They are merely reduced to their most basic form of plain text, line breaks as the only formatting retained. As such these 1.1M texts form the generic domain of text onto which the personal projections in WIPT will be cast. They provide the substrate through which WIPT can expose precise contexts from an amount of writing no single individual could read, and they stage the demonstration of a personal perspective set against a public domain of text. In this thesis demonstrated through the quotes in red and magenta . The metadata accompanying each file was recorded as available upon retrieval and used to populate a minimal dictionary: ID, Title, Author, Year, Edition, Publisher, City, Pages. Based on this information, Chicago-style endnote references are constructed for the red and magenta quotations that appear throughout the thesis. Given the quantity and heterogeneity of the dataset, no additional effort was taken to reduce textual noise originating from bibliographies, tables of contents, OCR artefacts, or other causes that may produce segments not immediately recognisable as running prose. In practice, the vast majority of the corpus is legible plain text with the occasional interruption of a page number mid-sentence. This was not deemed a major issue: projections are expected to circumvent such noise by virtue of resonance, since illegible strings tend not to produce strong matches with intended queries; or, where they do, the query itself will likely be of an equally obscure and illegible nature. Furthermore, no form of thematic filtering has been applied. The current building of this dataset has simply been concerned with gathering a large amount of text from published documents; the nature, reliability, correctness, or norms of its contents lie outside the remit of this stage. Inevitably, the corpus therefore contains texts with which I may fundamentally disagree, or even find highly problematic; such is the condition of the generic and the digitally available flow from which these documents are obtained. What matters is not the mere presence of these documents within this dataset, but the manner of engagement with them. How they are proportioned, cast, and set into resonance by an instrument designed to work with abundance rather than to legislate it. Echoing this posture, whilst referencing Calasso, Riccardo Villa notes the epistemic upheaval that the digital introduces: Once it becomes digital, every form of knowledge does not simply stand but is always open to digitability. To quote Calasso, it turns into an encyclopedia that juxtaposes impeccably reliable information with baseless information, equally accessible and on the same level.\""}
