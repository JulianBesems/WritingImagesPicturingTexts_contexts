Selected: Although such programs are beginning the work of creating a culture and tradition of research, borrowing from more established fields such as psychology, computer science, and linguistics, Richard Buchanan (1999) has argued that design is different from traditional academic fields, a “transdiscipline” that focuses not on subject matters but on problems and on production as a mode of inquiry. As such, we should note that it has much in common with the Aristotelian conception of rhetoric. Researchers in English and communication departments recently have shown great interest in the role of visual communication within their own research domains, as illustrated by the increasing number of conferences, special journal issues, and courses in this area. 7 Reconceptualized doctoral programs are necessary, for several reasons.[Petraglia, Joseph, and Deepika Bahri *Realms of Rhetoric: The Prospects for Rhetoric Education*. 2011.]

02. "The use of typical situations as a primary vehicle of design is a new departure toward an approach that may best be described as situational or as a new poetics of architecture (figure 8. 15). The aim of the new poetics is not to become a new theory but to formulate a limited set of creative principles, articulate in the fullest possible way the content and structure of the typical situations, and establish the basic orientation of design. The articulation of content may include contributions from nonarchitectural areas, such as theater, painting, literature, or poetry, where we very often find a surprisingly rich understanding of architectural space."[Vesely, Dalibor *Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation: The Question of Creativity in the Shadow of Production*. The MIT Press, 2004.]

03. "We flirted with a systematic approach to game design and tried two alternative models—one based on cooperation, one on competition—to be tested for research and classroom use. In the initial interface, we imagined the game taking place from a “source text” as a series of “moves” composed in a “work space” that could make use of textual, musical, visual, or time-based media materials."[Hawk, Byron, David M. Rieder, and Ollie Oviedo *Small Tech: The Culture of Digital Tools*. Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2008.]

04. "She emphasizes that to understand and use the computer as a “representational medium,” designers should be able to draw on history, myth, ritual, narrative, patterns of repetition, and spatial and temporal orientations—rhetorical resources, all—as well as on technical considerations such as database design and user-interface development. Integrating the disciplines of written, oral, and visual communication, each with its own resources for theory and research, could produce important academic programs positioned to address the communication practices and problems of a digital age."[Petraglia, Joseph, and Deepika Bahri *Realms of Rhetoric: The Prospects for Rhetoric Education*. 2011.]

07. "This approach can instead involve “metaphorizing” the literal sentences in the relevant discourse segment: translating the information in them into sourcedomain terms. We present this possibility as a potentially fruitful topic for future research into metaphor. Conclusion AI is not just about the engineering of “intelligent” artefacts for useful purposes but also about mapping out the space of possible principles and mechanisms of cognition, whether artificial or natural."[Jr., Raymond W.

08. "Their use in industrial design, artistic applications, and museum interaction entails some innovative uses for touch in a craft and design context. Traditional CAD/CAM utilizes a predominantly visual interface, requiring movement of the mouse on a two-dimensional (2D) desktop to be translated into a threedimensional (3D) virtual model within a visual display. Traditional input through the keyboard and mouse, as Robert Stone argues, is regarded as “very user-unfriendly and completely inadequate for creating organic, free-form shapes” (“MUSE Virtual Presence”)."[Hawk, Byron, David M.

They argued that "the two-domain model is actually part of a larger and more general model of conceptual projection," and they called this new model the "many-space" model. 3 Both the earlier two-domain model and the later many-space model of conceptual integration are part of ongoing research. into blending (see Coulson & Oakley, eds. 2000). The most widely disseminated definition of blending can be found on Turner's web-site (http://www. wam. umd. edu/---mturn/), as well as in many of his articles and will therefore be reproduced here as the standard definition: Conceptual blends arise from conceptual integration."[Dirven, Rene, and Ralf Porings *Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast (Cognitive Linguistics Research, 20.)*. 2002.]

10. "Each section proposes complementary and comparative views from interdisciplinary research (mostly anthropological, but also sociohistorical and science-historical) on different areas of practice. Showing by contrast is both a strategy for apprenticeship and the style of these case studies. For example, brain imaging is compared to navigating skills; wood-sculpting to C. A. D. (computer-aided design) drawing; the Linnaean botanical drawings used in colonial botany are compared against pictorial production in the colonies; the skills of medieval masonry with the ones of managing the London underground traffic."[(ed.), Cristina Grasseni *Skilled Visions: Between Apprenticeship and Standards*. Berghahn Books, 2007.]

11. "From a scientific perspective, it seems to be perfectly possible to bring continuous adaptation and operation to processes, but that does not mean there is still a clear model for how to do this. The problem is quite similar to the one studied by Deming. The answer might begin by factoring out the semantics of a process completely into a different level of description, leaving behind a purely dynamical one, without risk of semantic instability. The role of the ‘composer’ is then to design a performance that is stable and repeatable, with a continuous viewpoint."[Burgess, Mark *In Search of Certainty: The Science of Our Information Infrastructure*.

12. "On average, the resulting time window lasted 1073 ms, with some modest variation between items and conditions, given the separate recordings that had to be used for this part of the stimuli. Target advantage scores were computed as detailed above and transformed into empirical logits. As before, we used mixed-effects models to analyze the data. As the range of possible random effect structures (RES) becomes more complex in an interaction design, we use the following shorthand indications to facilitate presentation of results."[(eds.), Florian Schwarz *Experimental Perspectives on Presuppositions*. Springer International Publishing, 2015.]

13. "But methodical work provides a different kind of support. It retains the knowledge that emerges through intuition. We use both these work approaches, intuitive and methodical, in successful systems development, and the skill lies in the ability to alternate between the two, in being able to use the intuitive process to create new knowledge, and the discursive process for critical comparative evaluations. They become interwoven so that the discursive process in its turn opens the door for the intuitive process."[Goranzon, Bo, Richard Ennals, and Maria Hammeron *Dialogue, Skill and Tacit Knowledge*. 2006.]
