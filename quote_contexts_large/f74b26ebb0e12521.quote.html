    <pre>This projection is thus a two-stage proportioning: first by weighted overlap to secure relevance, then by quota-constrained gains to keep the list variegated across the input vocabulary, producing a compact legible image constellation around the words rather than a repetitive cluster. Because the searches are acknowledged to always be partial they bring a further insight into the figurative screen as to which sorts of figurative features are brought to the foreground through their presence alongside the aspects by which they were projected.</pre>

    <div class="selected">The condition that a category I has a terminal object ω says something about the undercategories (i ↓ ω) for each object i; likewise, the condition that a functor α : K → I be homotopy terminal says something about the undercategories (i ↓ α). So the adjective ‘terminal’ lets one remember how to connect all these concepts (and likewise for ‘initial’). One also has the following analog of Theorem 6. 9: 28 DANIEL DUGGER Theorem 6. 14.

<li>&quot;Consider a (somewhat simplified) example. Let C be some object or, rather, substance; call it Corsicus. Now suppose that Corsicus is such that whenever it is put in water it dissolves. Let A be this pattern of sensible events.&quot;[Wilson, Fred *The Logic and Methodology of Science in Early Modern Thought: Seven Studies*. University of Toronto Press, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;Allegory (one might think) behaves in rather the same way. Look how Plato offers an allegory—the sun—for the intelligible world dominated by the form of the good: But, my lucky friends, let us leave for now the question of what the good itself is, for it seems to me to be beyond the scope of our present attempt to arrive at what I think about that now; instead I should like to describe something that seems to be an offspring of the good, and very like it, if that is pleasing to you; if not, I am happy to leave it.&quot;[McCabe, Mary Margaret *Platonic Conversations*.

<li>&quot;109–10). 14 Martin R. Dean, “Nature as a Book—a Book as Nature,” Journal of Garden History 17 (1997), 172–73. 15 Carmontelle, Jardin de Monceau, Paris, 1779, 4. A translation of the passage reads in part: “If a picturesque garden can be made into a territory of illusions, why shouldn’t we do it?Illusions provide only delight; if liberty guides them, let art direct them, and we’ll never be far from nature. Nature varies according to climate; let us try through illusion to vary climates also, or rather to banish the memory of our own; let us carry into our gardens the scene-changes of the Opera; let us show, in a real situation, what the best painter might design as decor—all times and all places. ” For more on this passage, see my essay, “The Garden as Virtual Reality,” in Das künstliche Paradies: Gartenkunst im Spammungsfeld von Natur und Gesellschaft, ed.&quot;[Coan, Michel *Perspectives on Garden Histories (Dumbarton Oaks Colloquium Series in the History of Landscape Architecture) (v. 21)*.

<li>&quot;The size of a node indicates how quantitative the correlation weight is. For connection relations, there are three types of lines between the nodes: the solid paths for direct connection relations between elements on two diﬀerent tables, and the solid paths between nodes on the same table –which represents a correlation of messages– and dashed paths between diﬀerent tables for indirect connection relations (Fig. 2g). With that encoding, the user can interact by hovering on and selecting the node or link that s/he wants to examine, where more visual cues are added to the associated nodes and connection links.&quot;[Kreinovich, Vladik, Songsak Sriboonchitta, and Nopasit Chakpitak (eds.) *Predictive Econometrics and Big Data*.

<li>&quot;71 For a useful discussion of ἐπιστήμη and its relation to practices (ἐπιτηδεύματα) and virtue, see Rist, Eros and Psyche: Studies in Plato, Plotinus, and Origen, 115–156. 72 Symp. 210d5-6. 73 Symp. 210d3-7. 74 Symp. 210d6-7. 75 Good was earlier substituted for beauty at 204e1-3; the daimon Eros was described as intermediate between the beautiful and ugly, wisdom and ignorance, immortal and mortal, good and bad; there is perhaps, then, good reason to view the beautiful, good, immortal, and wisdom as coextensive, though not as identical.&quot;[Lamascus, Lorelle D. *The poverty of Eros in Plato’s Symposium*.

<li>&quot;And hence forth shall the charming child I’ the starry heavens be set, And, rising, setting, clear and mild, Shoot twinkles at us yet. 14 The following, with the scriptural title of “Vanitas vanitatum vanitas,” is a good disclosure of the author’s philosophy of life: I’ve set my heart upon nothing, you see; Hurrah!And so the world goes well with me. Hurrah!And who has a mind to be fellow of mine, Why, let him take hold and help me drain These mouldy lees of wine. I set my heart at first upon wealth; Hurrah!&quot;[Brownson, Orestes A., Patrick W. Carey, and Patrick W. Carey *Early Works of Orestes A. Brownson: The Transcendentalist Years, 1838-39*. Marquette University Press, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Using this, one obtains very slick proofs of most of the main theorems. 11. 1. Basic definitions. Let M be a simplicial model category (see Section 8. 2). The reader is free to assume M = Top, but we have reason for the extra generality. Let I be a small category and let X : I → M and W : I op → M. Define B• (W, I, X) to be the simplicial object a (11. 2) [n] 7→ W (i0 ) × X(in ). i0 ←i1 ←···←in The face map dj corresponds to ‘covering up ij ’, with two provisos.&quot;[D., Dugger *A primer on homotopy colimits*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;If two goods are somehow rightly pronounced to be equally good, no circumstance can render one better than the other. And if the locus in which the good is to arise is somehow pronounced to be indifferent, it will certainly be indifferent whether that good arises in me or in you. But how shall these two pronouncements be made? In practice, values cannot be compared save as represented or enacted in the private imagination of somebody: for we could not conceive that an alien good was a good (as Mr. Russell cannot conceive that the life of an ecstatic oyster is a good) unless we could sympathise with it in some way in our own persons; and on the warmth which we felt in so representing the alien good would hang our conviction that it was truly valuable, and had worth in comparison with our own good. The voice of reason, bidding us prefer the greater good, no matter who is to enjoy it, is also nothing but the force of sympathy, bringing a remote existence before us vividly sub specie boni.&quot;[Coleman, Martin A. *The Essential Santayana: Selected Writings*. Indiana University Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Men bring what they have in themselves and see it reﬂected in the Scripture. 345 On Thoughts and Aphorisms 483 – My lover took away my robe of sin and I let it fall, rejoicing; then he plucked at my robe of virtue, but I was ashamed and alarmed and prevented him. It was not till he wrested it from me by force that I saw how my soul had been hidden from me. Let us drop our robe of virtue so that we may be ready for the Truth. 5 22 April 1970 484 – Sin is a trick and a disguise of Krishna to conceal Himself from the gaze of the virtuous.&quot;[Mother, The *On Thoughts and Aphorisms*. 2nd ed. 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;Babel appears in Genesis 11: Now the whole earth had one language and few words. And as men migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. ” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. ” And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of men had built.&quot;[Higgins, Hannah *The grid book*. MIT Press, 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;We’ll outline the proof of this following [Schl], leaving most steps as exercises for the reader. First, let Iω denote the subcategory of Set whose objects are the sets (n) together with ω, and where the maps are the monomorphisms. Let j : I ,→ Iω denote the evident inclusion. Finally, let BM denote the category with one object and endomorphism set M , and let i : BM → Iω denote the inclusion sending the unique object of BM to ω. The following exercise contains a key result due to J. Smith, which first appeared in [Sh, Lemma 2. 2. 9].&quot;[D., Dugger *A primer on homotopy colimits*. 2008.]</li>

<li>&quot;The Gerardi index, however, satisfies property 3 in addition to the other properties which the Geary–Khamis index satisfies [36, p. 83]. These two indices are studied in great detail in ref. 14. A serious problem common to all multilateral index number formulas is that for m &gt; 2 the PPP between two countries r and s is not independent of the value of m. A typical example of the main use of PPP, based on [18, pp. 5–10], is shown in Table 1, which is self-explanatory. (The PPPs in this example were calculated by the Geary–Khamis method. )&quot;[Read, Campbell B., N. Balakrishnan, Brani Vidakovic, and Samuel Kotz *Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences*. 2nd.
