To block out an undesirable view, use a stained glass panel the size of the window; to focus attention on the view, select a rectangular or curved stained glass frame around clear glass. Clear glass mixed at random with colored glass in a single panel gives a feeling of depth. Dramatic window accents can be beautiful, but if too much light enters a room, furnishings can take a beating.", "suggested_query": "The neutral frame, then, is the threshold between the window's transparent function and its opaque presence. It is this threshold that allows for the transformation of a view into a picture, and in turn, for the transformation of the spectator's gaze from a direct engagement with the external world to a mediated one, where the frame acts as a filter between the self and the outside. As a result, the relationship between the inside and outside is no longer immediate, but rather one that is filtered and mediated through the frame.", "suggest_context": "In all of this the window serves as the prop for discovering new and unexpected relationships between the inside and outside. This window, like any other, relies on mechanisms of operation, instruments of opening and closure. Fundamentally, glass is hard, yet fragile and brittle. The polished surface receives the gaze and, through its invisibility, reects eeting glimpses of the other, much like a mirror. Even with perfectly clear glass, the extent of this view is bounded because most glass panels require a frame. The neutral frame isolates the glass and what may be seen through it from its context Ortega y Gassett 1986: 24. The frame turns the view into a picture and alters the nature of the spectators gaze."}
