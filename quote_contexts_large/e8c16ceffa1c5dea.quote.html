    <pre>In this thesis we will not attempt to encode all these non-geometrical dimensions directly into a single, comprehensive model. Instead, we treat them as a field of possibilities and domains against which any digital architectural instrument has to be positioned. Such an instrument must leave room for textual, temporal, atmospheric and scalar operations that cannot be collapsed into geometry or into a single logic of optimisation. If architecture is partly constituted by what it does across media, it must accept that some of its crucial operations live in probabilities, atmospheres, and misalignments.</pre>

      <li>&quot;This new condition of textualization within Internet language, and the layers of translation and transit required in online communication, reroute my discussion back to an earlier debate on the transformation of natural languages and the mutation of alphabetic writing into moving, animated, and ultimately postalphabetic forms of textual communication. Text moves not only because it can be animated, however, but because the language behind this written representation is also moving, shifting, alternating from one language domain to another.&quot;[Sutil, Nicolás Salazar *Motion and Representation: The Language of Human Movement*.

<li>&quot;To discuss the courtyard house in terms of the polarity between ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ is futile. The courtyard model demands consideration in a broader theoretical framework that acknowledges the role of the study of traditional typologies in the process of design. Practitioners must ask whether vernacular architecture is a valid source to be considered during the design process and, if so, then they must critically examine what is meant by tradition and how it can be employed. This chapter argues that a study of the regional tradition is valuable as a learning tool for the designer, especially those operating in the Gulf region.&quot;[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;One example of this is the kind of protogeometrical vision that can underlie both the seemingly different structures found in formal dance (e. g. , ballet or Forsythe technique) and mathematical geometry. Throughout this book I will consider two facets of a language machine: the abstract and the concrete. The concrete aspect of a language machine refers to the actual embodiment or materialization of a motor language through physicalized or mechanized movement performance. Thus, a concrete language of movement is performed closer to some kinetic hardware: a body or mechanical/computational device.&quot;[Sutil, Nicolás Salazar *Motion and Representation: The Language of Human Movement*. The MIT Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Most important, the space represented must seem contiguous with that in front of the picture: Its space must also appear to be our space (Leffert, 20–2 1). The choice of what is to be painted, then, is governed by the principle of maximum fidelity; letters, papers, curtains, and even canvases themselves are common objects represented in such paintings, in part because their flatter dimensions can be rendered most believably and fool the viewer into ‘‘seeing’’ what is in fact not there. Here I am distinguishing, following Mastai, between trompe l’oeil and architectural illusionism, which certainly shares some, but not all, of the features of such paintings as described here.&quot;[(editor), Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka *Human Creation Between Reality and Illusion (Analecta Husserliana)*.

<li>&quot;This accommodation can be addressed from varying viewpoints: (1) philosophically, in terms of satisfying a human and social need; (2) legally, referring to code requirements that must be fulfilled; and (3) pragmatically, insofar as barrier-free concepts should be seen as a means to plan interior spaces that are more comfortable for all users—often referred to as universal design. The purpose here is not to address the conceptual or philosophical aspects of universal design but to present it as one necessary factor in the space planning process.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics, 4th Edition*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Since his representation must simultaneously be a detached interpretation, he must always ask the question of what context he should see the building’s commission and commissioner. This context should never be a general one, but should always be as precise and specific as possible. Therefore ‘Building in Renaissance Italy’ or ‘Architecture in Imperial China’ can only be the easy title of a glossy book, but never the context of serious architectural research.&quot;[Mekking, Aart J.J., and Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;These in architecture give rise to specifically &#x27;architectural values&#x27;. As we have seen, harmony is nearly a synonym for design, and the elements of any composition are ordered by imposing a &#x27;pattern&#x27; upon them. To be aesthetically satisfying this pattern must be endowed with &#x27;unity&#x27;, i. e. it must contain a dominant theme or centre of interest (focus or climax) and all parts must be related to the whole. The architect does not consider the aesthetic problem as merely a question of applying ornament to a finished scheme, but begins at once by arranging his basic elements of plan and mass (not only in size, but in colour, tone, texture, strength and vigour of design) i6i L THORN house: A reinforced concrete frame structure.&quot;[West, T. W *A history of architecture in England*. 2nd ed. David McKay Company,Inc., 1966.]</li>
<li>&quot;This spatial determination of language can be questioned, however, by adding further dimensions to thought, from which one might expect further dimensions of language to emerge. We return to an idea I brought up in the introduction, and which I borrowed from Rodolfo Llinás (2002): linguistic language is part of a larger category that includes motor languages. In other words, speech and words are only one fraction of the entire production of language generated by the human brain, and which includes motor languages.&quot;[Sutil, Nicolás Salazar *Motion and Representation: The Language of Human Movement*. The MIT Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;One could more accurately say that the visual provides a glimpse of an “ontology without ontology,” to adopt the rhetorical figure of Meister Eckhart’s preference. Beckett has no doubt that the visual medium is able to achieve what language cannot: its immediacy eludes language. Only the visual, Beckett insinuates time and again, can disclose the immediate presence of phenomena because it skips the mediation of language.&quot;[Beckett, Samuel, Samuel Beckett, Sandra Wynands, and Samuel Beckett *Iconic spaces : the dark theology of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s drama*. Notre Dame, Ind: University of Notre Dame Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Representation involves presence. It gives presence to what had hitherto not been presented. It is of course this formulation that marks the problem representation poses for itself. Any representation must lack authenticity in its striving to be authentic. A painting of a bowl of oranges can never be the same as a bowl of oranges. Consequently a representation must try and capture an essential quality. The representation must recognize the impossibility of camera-work and try therefore to present the reality of the object.&quot;[Benjamin, Andrew *Art, Mimesis and the Avant-Garde: Aspects of a philosophy of difference*. 1991.]</li>
<li>&quot;That which can be shown is not the &quot;redemption&quot; of place, but the dissonance existing between the equivalence of technico-scientific space and the characteristic of space as a game of a combination of places, where things are gathered and dwell with man. This dissonance must be composed: even the extreme dissonances must be the object of composition. Loos and His Angel 172 But the Loosian exterior cannot therefore be reduced to a simple fiction supposedly hiding the truth-justice of the place.&quot;[Cacciari, Massimo, Stephen Sartarelli (transl.), and Patrizia Lombardo (introduction) *Architecture and Nihilism: On the Philosophy of Modern Architecture*.

<li>&quot;Jennifer Jaramillo, Architectural Intern, Dekker/Perich/ Sabatini, LLC  As architects, we must acknowledge our connectivity to others; we must know that what we see is often not the entire truth. We must venture beyond our comfortable boundaries into the reality of others. Kathryn T. Prigmore, FAIA, Senior Project Manager, HDR Architecture, Inc.  As building information models become standard in architecture practice, architects will reestablish themselves as the master builder coordinating the whole process from design to construction to post-occupancy.&quot;[Waldrep, Lee W. *Becoming an Architect: A Guide to Careers in Design*. 2nd ed.

<li>&quot;Consider how common it is today to take computer language as a paradigm for language as such. When we take computer language as a model for all language, we then see language as a set of rules that, if followed, allows one to produce in another an intended representation or response, just as a programming language 52 C. CULBERTSON allows one to successfully communicate instructions to a machine. Given how common it is for linguistic research to approach language in this way, it is striking to hear in Heidegger’s dialogue that language, in its essence, speaks like a hint or a gesture.&quot;[Marsh, Leslie *Walker Percy, Philosopher*. Springer International Publishing;Palgrave Macmillan, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;As pointed out earlier, the eccentricities of real projects cannot be simulated by planned exercises. It would take many long, detailed case study documents to begin to explain the variables that the designer must deal with in planning projects of even moderate size. Existing building conditions may present an unusual floor or ceiling construction assembly, a peculiar door detail, or an HVAC system that is particularly inflexible. Local building and zoning code requirements often place limitations on space planning options.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics, 4th Edition*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Both render the world in numerical terms: just as every medium becomes digitized; every entity becomes commoditized. Both stand between, and must take into account, the capacities (and limits) of people and the capacities (and limits) of machines—​a fact Manovich referred to as ‘dual encoding’ in the case of digital devices. For example, just as a computer program must be readable/​writable by a human, it must be runable/​storable by a machine; and just as an industrial commodity must be useful, or desirable, to a human, it must be producible with a machine.&quot;[Kockelmann, Paul *The Art of Interpretation in the Age of Computation*.
