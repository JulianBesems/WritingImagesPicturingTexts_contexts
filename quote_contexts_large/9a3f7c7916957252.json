Each mode - plan, section, model, image, text - carries its own semiotic logic and operational affordances. Rather than dissolving into a unified representation, these modalities sustain architectural reasoning through their interplay and disjunction. As Gunther Kress argues on multimodality in the process of learning in general, each mode brings distinct potentials shaped by its material and cultural history: \"While speech is based on the logic of time, still image is based on the logic of space. ... In image, meaning is made by the positioning of elements in that space; but also by size, colour, line and shape. Image does not have words; it uses depictions. Words can be spoken or written, images are displayed. ... Meaning relations are established by the spatial arrangement of entities in a framed space and the kinds of relation between the depicted entities.\" In architecture, this supports the notion that drawing, modelling, writing, and narration do not overlap but align momentarily through acts of design. The architects work lies in composing their proportionality, producing meaning by exploring the resonances and tensions that emerge across modes, an operation that extends beyond that of translating between the different notations of geometry. Modalities define not only what is represented but how thought itself is organised and communicated. This orchestration extends into communication and discourse as well. The architectural project is not finished when built; it is continuously mediated through publications, exhibitions, arguments, and critique; each constituting yet another modality. If we widen the lens from the building to the city, multimodality becomes even less a question of representations of an object and more a question of relations and gestures. In urbanism, the architect rarely designs a singular artefact in isolation; the work is to shape arrangements; connections and separations, gradients of access, densities, adjacencies, thresholds, patterns of movement and pause. These dispositions are mediated through plans and sections, but equally through schedules, codes and contracts, governance diagrams, budgets, consultation images, press narratives, and the friction of public argument. In this sense, the architectonic is not simply architecture at a larger scale; it is an emphasis on how architecture operates as a relational practice across heterogeneous media and publics. This shift clarifies what is at stake in speaking about architectural multimodality here. If modalities are treated as parallel depictions of a stable object, then the task is to align them. If, however, modalities are treated as operative instruments, then the project is not contained in any one of them. It is produced through their interplay: how a plan frames a possibility of movement, how a policy clause reconfigures a threshold, how an image persuades or provokes, how a diagram ranks priorities, how a brief scripts use, how a critique re-indexes a project within culture. Architectural work then consists in moving between modes, maintaining productive gaps, and composing their proportionality rather than eliminating difference.\n\n*The multimodal orchestration of architectural thought and practice can be seen as a form of situated cognition, where designers navigate and negotiate the complex networks of relations, gestures, and modalities that constitute the urban fabric. As they move between modes, architects produce and re-produce the city through a continuous process of exploration, experimentation, and critique. This relational practice of architecture is not limited to the built environment, but extends to the social and cultural contexts in which it is situated. In this sense, multimodality is not a static condition, but an ongoing process of negotiation and adaptation, where the architect's task is to compose the proportionality of multiple modes, rather than to resolve them into a single, unified representation.*", "suggested_query": "The multimodal orchestration of architectural thought and practice can be seen as a form of situated cognition, where designers navigate and negotiate the complex networks of relations, gestures, and modalities that constitute the urban fabric.
