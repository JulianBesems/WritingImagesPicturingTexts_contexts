    <pre>*“Nothing inevitable links the concavity of my nose with the convexity of my forehead. And yet your hand is no longer
free to stray about on the wall; now ‘you will’ something and impose upon your drawing this law from without: that it
must reproduce a given form.” *-Valéry</pre>

      <li>&quot;*Nothing inevitable links the concavity of my nose with the convexity of my forehead. And yet your . \ th all &quot; hand is no longer free to stray about on e w ; now you will&quot; something and impose upon your drawing this law :i from without: that it must reproduce a given form.* [390723681-Paul-Valery-Eupalinos-or-the-Architect-1.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9X8GE69S?page=23&amp;annotation=XIRFMIPE)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Since this convergence is always established arbitrarily, the picture produced is veritable only circumstantially, in relation to and depending on the contingency of that decision. In this analogy, the vanishing point would coincide with Blumenberg’s Sinnbezug, the contingent ref­erence of sense.* — **Beatiful comparison for the reference of the perspective as a new method but always only contextually true** [Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7EH52CZI?page=45&amp;annotation=BPLGJJCF)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*It is commonly believed that only an irreversible deduction by order, even more, that a single deductive chain guarantees the consistency of meditation. Thus, it is fitting to think according to the norms of &#x27;geometry&#x27;, from principles or terms that cannot be defined or from an evidence from which one cannot escape without doubting or erring* [00b. en gpt4 _Introduction [Serres, Michael_Le système de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8CLNKQ9?page=5&amp;annotation=4ZGMIEF6)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Serres’ notion of a system which contracts the invariant conservation (1st law, orthographia) and its drift towards dissolution (2nd law, ichnographia) is alway integrated, bound together (scenographia) mathematically, in models.* [VERABUEH - 2016 - Architectonic disposition ichnography, scenograph.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J3U2SLAT?page=7&amp;annotation=K3S5HNA6)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*One can admit, as a first approximation, that a punctual multiplicity represents the simplest model of such pluralism, generalized to the entirety of philosophical questions.* — **relevant to the multiplicity of an architectonic sculpture** [03.b. en (gpt) _ deuxiÃ¨me chapitre_ troisiÃ¨me partie [Serres, Michael_Le systÃ¨me de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9G4QDC2Y?page=4&amp;annotation=4THWGXSS)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The image is, here, richer than it was in Pascal: to optical and mechanical values are added infinitesimal, analytical, perspective, logical, physical and metaphysical meanings.* — **Interesting in terms of a mechanics of addition to an existing paradigm: similar though to expanding the digital encoding of architecure beyond that of optical and mechanical values!!!!** [03.b. en (gpt) _ deuxiÃ¨me chapitre_ troisiÃ¨me partie [Serres, Michael_Le systÃ¨me de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9G4QDC2Y?page=4&amp;annotation=2G2F32YF)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Technics—Cacciari writes—does not mean ideal constitution (Verfas­sung) of signs—but the immanent modalities of those transformations. Technics is the expression* — **CAADRIA - modalities!!** [Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7EH52CZI?page=76&amp;annotation=XQ8FREBQ)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*There is a kind of tautology here which involves assigning an architectonic function to an idea whose content is identical to the function.* [02.b. en (gpt) _deuxiÃ¨me chapitre_ deuxiÃ¨me partie [Serres, Michael_Le systÃ¨me de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGEHV9RY?page=4&amp;annotation=QZJ7PBDY)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The representation of nature becomes a “vectorial” one, so to speak, contingently oriented according to the point it takes as a reference and thus independ­ent from any supposedly necessary orientation.* [Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7EH52CZI?page=39&amp;annotation=ZM45Q3PD)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The resulting displacement of effort and indirectness of acce~smll seem t_ome to be distinguishing features of conventional arc_h1te~ture cons1dere~as a visual art, but whether always and necessarily d1sa_dvantageous 1s another question.* [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=5&amp;annotation=S9ANLS7C)&quot;</li>
