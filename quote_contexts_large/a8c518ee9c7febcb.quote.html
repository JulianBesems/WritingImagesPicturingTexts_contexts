    <pre>3.2 DOMAINS Domains in this context are the fields of information between which the projections take place, as well as those that establish said projections. In the architectural communication, domains could be understood as the ichnographic, orthographic and scenographic drawings. Here, given the focus on images and text, these will form the primary domains, with the third being a collection of documents that inherently contains both. The choice was made to have the interactions take place between two domains that can be seen as the generic, big enough to not be curated, and broad enough to be able to expose an exhaustive amount of information hosted by the writing. The projections between these two generics are however of a more precise nature, although we will explore the variety of scale within this as well.

<em>These projections can be seen as filters that narrow down the information within the domains, creating a new, more focused domain, and allowing for the exploration of different aspects within the data. This new domain can be seen as a refinement of the initial domains, as it selects specific subsets of information within the larger domains. By doing so, it enables the writer to create a narrative that is more specific, yet still broad enough to encompass the complexities of the information at hand.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;In such situations, representation is not a serious issue. A case consists of essentially a sequence of operators that are selected from a predefined set, along with additional information related to the choice of these operators. Carbonnell recommends recording the following pieces of information in each step of the solution process: Task decomposition (sub-goal structure), Alternatives considered and rejected, Rationale, Dependencies and Final solution. It is clear that all the above information can be easily captured by autonomous problem solvers.&quot;[Smith, Ian F.C. *Intelligent Computing in Engineering and Architecture: 13th EG-ICE Workshop 2006, Ascona, Switzerland, June 25-30, 2006, Revised Selected Papers*. Springer, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;This fact — that the generating procedure monotonically generates more complete information structures — could be interpreted as excluding the possibility for information loss and thus making design states reversible. However, the inclusion of an information removal operator is possible providing more flexibility at the cost of limiting search strategies [18]. Datta [4] also presents a visual notation for representing design correspondence between designer and typed feature structures, using the concepts of mixed initiative and rational conversation.&quot;[Smith, Ian F.C. *Intelligent Computing in Engineering and Architecture: 13th EG-ICE Workshop 2006, Ascona, Switzerland, June 25-30, 2006, Revised Selected Papers*. Springer, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The changing, aleatory quality of these emerging phenomena and the fractal nature of this structure—in which there is no universal metanetwork, and each subnetwork subdivides inﬁnitely into still smaller ones—combine to ensure that no division will ever be permanent or absolute. Information itself emerges only in the interval between too much and too little change. So, following Taylor, the meaning of the texts in this volume should emerge less from the groupings imposed by the editors (or the metalanguage of this Introduction) than from the spontaneous interaction between the various pieces.&quot;[Lunning, Frenchy *Limits of the Human*. University of Minnesota Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;), so that they can be compared to one another, in order to make the analysis useful. Not all of these objects imply the same type of analysis, since the amount of information they convey is different. Analysing a 200page book is different from analysing a graphic brand, since one is characterized by a large amount of information and the other is characterized by conciseness, clarity and extreme reduction of means. However, both elements have the common purpose of communicating graphically, and this justiﬁes a single analysis matrix.&quot;[Ahram, Tareq, Waldemar Karwowski, and Redha Taiar *Human Systems Engineering and Design: Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Human Systems Engineering and Design (IHSED2018): Future Trends and Applications, October 25-27, 2018, CHU-Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, France*.

<li>&quot;In the KMan tool, knowledge is mainly inferred from contextual information made easily accessible and filterable; the tool aims to manage Data, Information and Knowledge, without trying to fit particular items into any of these categories. An item might be input into the system as Information at a point in time A and be retrieved later with other information to form knowledge at a point in time B. Or, alternatively, something that is pure data for an experienced designer X, for instance, the dimensions of standard steel members, can later become the basis for knowledge inferral for a novice user Y that might read this as a summary of steel construction solutions.&quot;[Van Leeuwen, Jos P., and Harry J.P. Timmermans *Innovations in Design &amp; Decision Support Systems in Architecture and Urban Planning*. Springer, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;These are observations – examples that are good or bad. The information is relatively unstructured. This is qualitative and unstructured data that requires interpretation and application by humans. It is the weakest form of problemsolving information. Such information can be organized as case information and structured as a case-based reasoning system [23]. Given some case or condition, here is what is known about it?Given the case of ‘circulation’, the help system might identify alternative building configurations; for the case of ‘courtroom’ it would provide cases and design guidelines for that space type.&quot;[Smith, Ian F.C. *Intelligent Computing in Engineering and Architecture: 13th EG-ICE Workshop 2006, Ascona, Switzerland, June 25-30, 2006, Revised Selected Papers*.

<li>&quot;On the other hand, when we talk about a human-centered perspective we sometime tend to forget about the technology in our efforts to describe the human, her needs, social situation, etc. Thus, a challenge for anyone interested in understanding the current texturation of information and interaction technologies in our everyday world is to find a focus of analysis that is situated in between these two stereotypical worlds, i. e. to focus on the links or space in between rather than to focus on computers and humans as isolated entities.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Dretske identifies the alteration of a situation by information – its evention – as ‘learning’ (1981: 45 and passim), and gives information the following ‘nuclear’ sense: ‘a state of affairs contains information about X to just that extent to which a suitably placed observer could learn something about X by consulting it’ (1981: 45). Suffice to say that Dretske’s ‘state of affairs’ and ‘suitably placed observer’ all testify to the ‘situatedness’ of information that is being emphasized here. Learning, then, would be another name for the temporalization of meaning that is evented by information.&quot;[Fraser, Mariam, Sarah Kember, and Celia Lury *Inventive Life: Approaches to the New Vitalism*. SAGE Publications Ltd, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The source is the generator of (new) information. The channel is that set of existing conditions that generate no (new) information. … It is in the determination of what constitutes a relevant alternative, a determination that is essential to the analysis of any information-processing system (whether it results in knowledge or not) that we find the source of that otherwise puzzling ‘flexibility’ in our absolute cognitive concepts.&quot;[Fraser, Mariam, Sarah Kember, and Celia Lury *Inventive Life: Approaches to the New Vitalism*. SAGE Publications Ltd, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;How are these sessions related to the three aspects above?• • • • The nature of these questions is further summarized in Table 2 as they relate to each category identified. When looking at these categories as outlined in table x from a general perspective, it is easy to see how various online services, communities, virtual worlds, and social networking services could be analyzed via these questions. In essence, questions related to representation concern images of the user, or the user’s actions, i. e.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;There are sequences of 0s and 1s, without any precise meaning: they could be characters in a text, songs, 3d models, etc. Groups of bits form patterns used as codes. Structured and coded strings of bits are finally defined as data, whereas information is generally defined as data in context. In this “epistemological chain” of digital data, information marks the threshold in which the material properties are stored in the hardware can designed. This specific act is performed through algorithms which allow information to be “interpreted, manipulated, and filled with meaning” (Ross 1968, p. 11; quoted in Cardodo Llach 2012, p. 42).&quot;[Bottazzi, Roberto *Digital Architecture Beyond Computers: Fragments of a Cultural History of Computational Design*. Hardcover. Bloomsbury Visual Arts, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;And from my perspective I like to think about the enabling character of these new textures as a wholeness in terms of an interaction grid. This interaction grid might be physically manifested in physical objects but a huge part of this grid is about digital materials including e. g. online resources, storage, processing power, information flows (including the whole range of solutions from e. g. secure data transactions to open RSS-streams), communication sessions, functions, algorithms, and various representation techniques.&quot;[Wiberg, Mikael *Interactive Textures for Architecture and Landscaping: Digital Elements and Technologies*. Engineering Science Reference, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;This information was useful in helping neighbors use the tools to describe setting, evaluate situations, and prescribe redevelopment interventions to resolve problems. In this manner, the information system may be thought as the initial notion of what later became the EDC’s reflection space (Arias, 1994). Figure 3. 8: The Information Tool: predecessor of the EDC’s reflection space: (a) the digital base map of COLE on a property-by-property basis with (b) the 3D visualization capabilities of different types of information to indicate a priority area for intervention.&quot;[Arias, Ernesto G., Hal Eden, and Gerhard Fischer *Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory*. Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Action spaces are areas where stakeholders can construct designs and interact with the simulations; reflection spaces are those areas where argumentation, visualizations, and other information displays are presented to support the action space activities; and the first two are in turn supported by information spaces, such as GIS databases, Google Earth data, and live GPS data. While we distinguish between the reflection and action spaces, the line between the two is somewhat arbitrary: there can certainly be reflection activities that go on within the action spaces as well as design actions that can take place in reflection spaces.&quot;[Arias, Ernesto G., Hal Eden, and Gerhard Fischer *Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory*.
