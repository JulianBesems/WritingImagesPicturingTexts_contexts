For instance, the simplicity of a well-crafted error message or the unobtrusive guidance of a well-timed hint can elevate the user experience to an art form. In this sense, the surface of ornament is not a question of code, but of the invisible infrastructure that underlies our digital interactions.", "suggest_context": "Then what is the surface of ornament in a digital context? AI? Coding in natural language? Where does the simplicitly sit? In functional programming, through sheer elegance in code? Or exactly the opposite, where there is an absence of code in the operation? But then what about the literacy, because this is the clever thing about Ishigami and Nishizawa, they don't just automate or make something clean, they do the unexpected, impossible through sophisticated technological ability and knowledge - Literacy, but silently. Then how can we approach this not in the engineering manner but in the digital concept?"}
