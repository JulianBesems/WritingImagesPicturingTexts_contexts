This raises questions about the nature of these indices and how they relate to each other, particularly in cases where the conversation revolves around a specific topic like a playground. It would be interesting to investigate further whether there are any commonalities or patterns that emerge when examining the relationships between these indices and the topics they represent.", "suggest_context": "If this fails we use a fallback where xi  is set to cover 60 of the activation mass. 3. Binary mask and connectivity: Form B  c:AwtF, C; gamma  xi. Then we establish adjacent neighbourhood through connected cells based on lattice adjacency toroid wrap around with 8 surrounding cells. 4. U-matrix connectivity: The neighbourhoods are split up if connected across large U-matrix distances inverse cosine similarity between adjacent SOM cell vectors, indicating splits along semantic ridges: Uc,c'1-cosvc, vc'. 5. Split oversized regions: Regions above a set maximum size are split up along U-matrix creases. 6. Label: For each region Rj we record the peak index argmaxA in Rj This results in a variety of different divisions, sometimes very clearly fragmented like the first example, in some cases completely singular like with umbrella fig 3.5:7 or where the regions are less naturally distinct in which case the upper bound of coverages divides the large regions into multiple smaller ones like with night fig 3.5:8 and a mix between these as seen with beauty fig 3.5:9.

The reverse shows a further contrast compared to the textual internal projection of the topic of conversation. Where conversations about playgrounds onto the figurative and the playground as a figurative index projected on its own had a certain correspondence, at least in its primary region, the textual internal projection and the figurative playground onto text do not have any significant alignment based on the two textual screens comparing figures 3.5:2 and 3.5:10. From this we can clearly see the two aren't equivalent, nor are the projections reversible. But it also suggests that when a conversation revolves around a playground it does occur a significant amount of times that we also see a playground. However the topics that are discussed on the background of a playground do not have as strong a bias towards also mentioning a playground. An easier to measure metric is by showing that playground is in the top 6 of most relevant figurative indices to playground , while playground is in the top 12 of most relevant textual indices to playground ."}
