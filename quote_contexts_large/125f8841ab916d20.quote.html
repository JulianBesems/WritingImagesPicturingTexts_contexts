    <pre>In all of this the window serves as the prop for discovering new and unexpected relationships between the inside and outside. This window, like any other, relies on mechanisms of operation, instruments of opening and closure. Fundamentally, glass is hard, yet fragile and brittle. The polished surface receives the gaze and, through its invisibility, reects eeting glimpses of the other, much like a mirror. Even with perfectly clear glass, the extent of this view is bounded because most glass panels require a frame. The neutral frame isolates the glass and what may be seen through it from its context Ortega y Gassett 1986: 24. The frame turns the view into a picture and alters the nature of the spectators gaze.

<em>The neutral frame, then, is the threshold between the window&#x27;s transparent function and its opaque presence. It is this threshold that allows for the transformation of a view into a picture, and in turn, for the transformation of the spectator&#x27;s gaze from a direct engagement with the external world to a mediated one, where the frame acts as a filter between the self and the outside. As a result, the relationship between the inside and outside is no longer immediate, but rather one that is filtered and mediated through the frame.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;The polished surface receives the gaze and, through its invisibility, reﬂects ﬂeeting glimpses of the “other,” much like a mirror. Even with perfectly clear glass, the extent of this view is bounded because most glass panels require a frame. The neutral frame isolates the glass and what may be seen through it from its context (Ortega y Gassett 1986: 24). The frame turns the view into a “picture” and alters the nature of the spectator’s gaze. In an essay called “Fear of Glass: The Barcelona Pavilion,” the author says that glass allows eternal special currents to ﬂow through space (Quetglas 2001).&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Even though a structural frame appears across the face of the building, in certain places, such as the entryways, there is a misalignment between the expressed and the structural frame. On the upper levels a clear distinction between walling on the exterior and structure on the interior is apparent; what appears on the outside as the structural frame represents the actual load-bearing elements hidden within, but corrected. This use of “structure” as image also makes the “inﬁll” panel ambiguous: it is both integral with a wall and contained within a frame, which also means it is both heavy and lightweight.&quot;[Leatherbarrow, David, and Mohsen Mostafavi *Surface Architecture*. 2002.]</li>

<li>&quot;Unless the frame is steel, which offers no resistance to heat transmission, it provides some level of reduction in thermal transmittance. The frame factor and its effect on the window&#x27;s U-value establish a basis for comparison when considering the energy savings of a change in window frame or sash material. A window&#x27;s location in a building affects its conductivity. In their 1974 study Windows: Performance, Design and Installation, authors Beckett and Godfrey categorized window exposure by localized environmental conditions. &#x27;&quot;[York, New *Repairing Old and Historic Windows: A Manual for Architects and Homeowners*.

<li>&quot;Only fits across the top of a window frame. A focal point; usually mounted on the outside of a window frame. Curtain: A simple treatment, typically unlined, usually stationary or possibly hand drawn. Usually hung on a simple rod. Damask: A finer, thinner fabric than brocade, it mixes shiny and dull threads to create beautiful patterns of high luster. Can be crafted of silk, cotton, rayon or linen. Its patterns are usually reversible, an example being twocolor damask in which the colors reverse depending upon which side is shown.&quot;[Stoehr, Kathleen S., and Charles T.

<li>&quot;Toggle fixing shading or as part of a twin face wall 16. Glazing frame 11 Windows are fitted into stick glazing by applying an additional sub frame within the main framing against which the opening light is closed. The overall width of the window frame is usually of similar width to that of the main framing of mullions and transoms. Both outward or inward opening windows and doors are used, with some with their frames silicone bonded to the glass to reduce their visual impact externally, though the frames look similar from within the building.&quot;[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*. Ambra Verlag, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Moreover, as Deleuze points out, these rings and frames are all places, establishing “an operative ﬁeld” within the painting. Inside this ﬁeld, the frame exerts a force on the central ﬁgure, isolating a suspended body. Deleuze describes this force as a “double motion,” with the background ﬁelds of color pushing towards the ﬁgure and the ﬁgure pushing back. The subsequent tension accounts for the drama and oppression so characteristic of Bacon’s work. The framing also separates the iconic central shape from the continuity of the outside world, suggesting a profound, even universal, scenario. 67 Lynch utilizes domestic architecture in a comparable manner.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Only the basic frame stayed still, and this frame was meant to be almost invisible. A necessary prop—no more than that. As Esther McCoy wrote as a caption for an image of trees reflected on the glass walls of the Eames House, “After thirteen years of living in a house with exposed steel frame, Ray Eames said, ‘The structure long ago ceased to exist. I am not aware of it. ’ They lived in nature and its reflections—and reflections of reflections. ” 15IEE1 The house dissolved in a play of reflections, restless images that immediately caught the eye of the world.&quot;[Colomina, Beatriz *Domesticity at War*. The MIT Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Palladian window [page 41] Windows Treatments Made Simple Picture Window This window is designed to create a frame of the outside view. It consists of one or two large fixed pane of glass, which cannot be opened. It sometimes is flanked with two side panels that may be opened. In the process of planning window treatments, the light, the function and the type of window in A picture window frames the beautiful a room always impacts decisions. So, as you view outsideof this dining room. verify each window type, decide what level of natural lighting is needed and what will be the window’s purpose.&quot;[M.K., Makridakis, and Holland M. *How to Create Rooms of Radiance. Windows Treatments Made Simple*. 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;The inner window frame was not protected by the outer window. To isolate the inner window from the cavity air, the window was removed, and the cavity was sealed with insulation and a peel-and-stick membrane. After the repair, condensation and frost no longer formed between the windows or on the inner window frame. Conclusions The CRF is a reliable indicator of the condensation performance of a window as an isolated product under exposure conditions and installation details similar to those assumed in standard tests and analytical simulations.&quot;[Barry G. Hardman, Carl R. Wagus, and editors Theresa A. Weston *Performance and Durability of the Window-Wall Interface (ASTM special technical publication, 1484)*. 2006.]</li>

<li>&quot;See Modern Structures, p. 78. Exposed-frame curtain wall A type of glass curtain wall. Unlike the hidden-frame iteration, here the frame stands proud of the glass surface and may also include some additional trim. Although the frame is highlighted, its only structural function is to attach the glass panes to the supporting frame behind. See Walls and Surfaces, p. 99. F Fanlight A semicircular or elongated semicircular window sitting above a door but contained within the overall surround, with radiating glazing bars in the form of a fan or sunburst.&quot;[Hopkins, Owen *Reading Architecture  A Visual Lexicon*. Laurence King, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;This inner liner/awning then needs an outside frame, which is very similar to the first design style, the flat-framed window. Porthole windows can have any sort of mullion or divider used to divide the interior space of the window just as with the flat-framed windows. MULLION DETAILS Mullions are the additional delicate elements within the frame of the windows that add style and interest.&quot;[Smith, Sally J. *Fairy Houses: How to Create Whimsical Homes for Fairy Folk*.

<li>&quot;The new sections are secured to the old frame, and standard panning trim is clipped on or secured by screws to the existing wood. In some instances the new unit is placed in front of the existing window svs- tenn, and the remainder of the frame is covered by trim, thus substantially changing the window&#x27;s appearance. Because of rigid standardization of components, differences in size have to be accommodated by standard sizes expanded with panning trim. Because the material cannot easily be worked with in the field, adjustment is limited.&quot;[York, New *Repairing Old and Historic Windows: A Manual for Architects and Homeowners*.

<li>&quot;E S I E S I EES The visitor of 1964 could achieve “ unity” only through a “frame,” a collage of images assembled as he or she moved through the fair. This visitor, unlike that of 1939, was given the illusion of control (control over the images both “ inside” the house and “outside” on the fairgrounds). This “frame” became that of the television screen. Television was everywhere. Virtually every exhibit in the fair involved television. Indeed, the fair itself was read at the time as “ the biggest television set in the world,” in the words of one reporter.&quot;[Colomina, Beatriz *Domesticity at War*. The MIT Press, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;This window is an instance of Scarpa’s method of reinvention and exploration of even the most conventional elements of architecture. The design consists of an unglazed circular opening behind which is a larger rectangular opening containing a glazed timber frame. 22 The inter-reflection of light in the void between the outer façade and the inner frame, and the softness of the rounded marble lining to the circular opening, achieve a transition from the bright exterior to the subdued illumination of the office.&quot;[Hawkes, Dean *The Environmental Imagination: technics and poetics of the architectural environment*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Seen from the other side of the room, it appears as a beautiful silhouette. If the usual pair of sliding shoji are placed within the perimeter of a window, it is possible to have only half of it open at any time, but if the shoji frame is extended and only one shoji inserted, it becomes possible to have the entire window open. The frame joints must of course be at perfect right angles, and the sides parallel; otherwise it will not match well with the window.&quot;[Yagi, Koji *A Japanese Touch for Your Home*.

<li>&quot;The introduction of irregular shapes has been possible as a result of the development of digital cutting tools. Interface with external envelope In common with reinforced concrete frames, steel frames can be either exposed outside the external skin or set inside the building; but when set externally, the frame is typically thermally insulated to reduce thermal movement of the frame. However MCH_ 298 3D detail view showing curved steel I-beam connection the connection of the externally-set columns and beams to the floor slab through the external wall can be challenging.&quot;[Watts, Andrew *Modern Construction Handbook*.

<li>&quot;Something is always askew in Lynch’s houses: his rooms “don’t look well” either. However, the ﬂattening perspective of two-dimensional photography is especially distorting for Loos’ work. As Beatriz Colomina explains, Loos’ interiors “are experienced as a frame for action rather than as an object in a frame. ”10 Walking within a Loos house, one feels how rooms converge and delineate themselves unexpectedly, how optical connections are impossible to traverse physically. To use a cinematic term—and Loos himself was a keen ﬁlm critic—the “cut” (or, sometimes, the lack of it) between domestic scenes is highly unusual in his designs.&quot;[Martin, Richard *The Architecture of David Lynch*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;A good way to allow for the combination of these tolerances in the primary structure is to set the outer face of the light steel frame 20 mm outside of the designed face of the primary frame. The outer face of the light steel frame then becomes the coordinating plane for the render system and placement of windows. The position of windows in plan and height can be further defined by other coordinating planes that define the structural opening position and size within the light steel frame. Typically, the light steel frame manufacturer will increase window openings by 3 mm all around to avoid small manufacturing deviations affecting the designed window opening.&quot;[al Wright, C. et *Insulated render systems used with light steel framing*.

<li>&quot;Notice, too, how the treatment also works beautifully as a corona over the bed frame —- a sweeping focal point. Scarf: A single, lengthy piece of lightweight fabric with a color/pattern that shows on both sides (as opposed to simply being imprinted on one side) that either wraps loosely around a stationary rod, or loops through decorative brackets placed on either side of a window frame.
