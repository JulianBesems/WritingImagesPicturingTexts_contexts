Selected: A screen reader is simply a program that does some analysis of the text that appears on a screen, or in a window, and passes it to a text-to-speech synthesizer. Most screen readers are phenomenally unintelligent about their analysis of what is on the screen. Commonly, for example, they will read a text line-by-line, without any consideration of what kind of text it is and therefore whether it is appropriate to read it in that fashion—for example, in the case of poetry or a list of short bullet items; or if it is ordinary prose text, such as what 244 Language, Technology, and Society you are reading now, where line breaks serve no function other than to Wt text on the page.[Sproat, Richard *Language, Technology, and Society*. 2010.]

02. "3. 2 KEY CONCEPTS TEXT AND DISCOURSE A text can be defined as any stretch of language which forms a unified whole, whether spoken, written or electronic. In a railway carriage, for example, you might be exposed to language such as: Alarm. Lift flap & pull handle. That’s all right, I’ll just get the Met. Any tickets from Stockport?Spurs on the slide as Butt posts late winner. Between London Euston – Manchester Pi. No, I’m on the train. Such disconnected scraps of language do not form a coherent whole and therefore do not constitute a text."[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

03. ". . Writers are not only inscribing text. They are also repeatedly rereading text that they’ve written, revising text as they write as well as going back later to revise, pausing to read other texts (their own notes, texts they have written, source materials, inspirations), pausing to think and plan. (Prior 2004: 170) The context of production and the activities that this encompasses are seen as part of the whole practice of text production. A text is accomplished through the organisation of language resources, but its meaning relies on its relationship to other previous texts, other similar texts and to the knowledge brought to its reading by a reader."[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

04. "I had a chance to dabble in machine translation and information extraction. My interest in speech synthesis, and in particular the problem of how to get computers to read from ordinary text, got me interested in the question of how text actually represents language, and thus how writing systems work. The present book is in many ways a synthesis of a wide variety of areas that it has been my good fortune to work on over the years. The book also grew out of a course that I developed during my five and a half years at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which was called ‘Language, Technology and Society’."[Sproat, Richard *Language, Technology, and Society*. 2010.]

05. "TEXT AND DISCOURSE Text refers to a stretch of language which forms a unified whole. Discourse refers to: 1 2 3 a linguistic unit above the level of the sentence (more or less equivalent to ‘text’); the use of language in a given context, e. g. legal discourse, classroom discourse (text + context); the way language embodies ways of thinking, being and acting in the world (text + context + practice). (cf. Swann et al. 2004: 83) Along a spectrum from ‘text’ to ‘practice’, discourse analysis at one extreme would look at texts as linguistic objects without regard to their function within a social context, while at the other end it would focus on practices as social action, without relating this to any concrete linguistic data."[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

06. "A translation in English also is provided, including an attempt to illustrate paraphasic errors. The cohesion analysis In Halliday and Hasan’s (1976) study of cohesion, text is referred to as any passage, spoken or written, of whatever length, that forms a unified whole. A text is considered to be a semantic unit of language in use whose cohesion  that is, what makes it a unified whole  is provided by the semantic relations among its elements. The occurrence of a pair of semantically related items in a text is defined as a tie , and, in a given text, five different patterns of ties can be found: reference , substitution, conjunction , lexical , and ellipsis."[Centeno, Jose G., Raquel T. Anderson, and Loraine K. Obler *Communication Disorders in Spanish Speakers: Theoretical, Research and Clinical Aspects (Communication Disorders Across Languages)*. 2007.]

07. "", excluding temporal reference as a structuring device, suggesting either an object-oriented organization or a structure which follows the spatial organization of the picture. The characteristics of the first text segment with respect to the referential movement correspond to what has been said for descriptive texts. The referential fillers show properties typical for this text type: the time reference is unspecified, and the predicates are all unbounded states. At the end of text CI the same picture emerges again."[Dietrich, Rainer, and Carl F Graumann *Language processing in social context*. North-Holland, 1989.]

08. "Of course, for all of its widespread use for more than 150 years, telegraphy remained largely the domain of specialists. Very few people learned how to operate telegraphs, or the Morse code needed to send the signals. It was not until the widespread availability of computers that electronic communication of text became available in practice to everyone. The history and some of the design features of computer coding systems for text are the topic of the next section. 6. 2. 2. 2 EBCDIC and ASCII Computers represent text as a sequence of numbers."[Sproat, Richard *Language, Technology, and Society*. 2010.]

09. ". Recommendations for linguists Computational Linguistics has often been divided into two extreme positions. On one hand the community of researchers involved in lexicography and computational treatment of texts have developed tools for the treatment of large amounts of linguistic data, as well as linguistic studies based mostly on statistics. This was true in the Sixties and early Seventies, when text processing was based on punched cards, the software definition of special characters and diacritics, and printing chains for those special characters, and is true now, when texts are marked-up and standardised by the use of exchange languages like SGML or XML."[Van Sterkenburg, P. G. J., and Republique tcheque International congress of linguists 17 Prague *Linguistics Today: Facing A Greater Challenge*. 2004.]

10. "The main features of different forms of writing are used appropriately, beginning to be adapted to different readers. Sequences of sentences extend ideas logically and words are chosen for variety and interest. The basic grammatical structure of sentences is usually correct. Spelling is usually accurate, including that of common, polysyllabic words. Punctuation to mark sentences—full stops, capital letters and question marks—is used accurately. Handwriting is joined and legible. Level 4 Pupils’ writing in a range of forms is lively and thoughtful."[Toolan, Michael *Language Teaching: Integrational Linguistic Approaches (Routledge Advances in Communication and Linguistic Theory)*. 2008.]

11. "Ideas are often sustained and developed in interesting ways and organised appropriately for the purpose of the reader. Vocabulary choices are often adventurous and words are used for effect. Pupils are beginning to use grammatically complex sentences, extending meaning. Spelling, including that of polysyllabic words that conform to regular patterns, is generally accurate. Full stops, capital letters and question marks are used correctly, and pupils are beginning to use punctuation within the sentence."[Toolan, Michael *Language Teaching: Integrational Linguistic Approaches (Routledge Advances in Communication and Linguistic Theory)*. 2008.]

12. "Harris’s integrationist theory of writing provides a vigorous solution that manages to clearly tease writing apart from the transcription of speech, which is just one of writing’s possible uses. Instead, writing is (re)aligned with spatial configurations in general (Harris, 1995). Postcard From Tunis presents an integrationist exploration of writing and its possible transformations at the human-computer interface. Pictures are not dominated by writing, as is so often the case in language learning and elsewhere, but instead the two are treated as complementary facets of one integrated form of communication, that is, spatial communication."[Toolan, Michael *Language Teaching: Integrational Linguistic Approaches (Routledge Advances in Communication and Linguistic Theory)*. 2008.]

13. "To simplify this text analysis the author has obtained a computerized version of the three catechisms. 1 This includes a reverse-order dictionary, a word-frequency dictionary, an item-locating dictionary listing every separate word with its specific location in the texts, and a search capability that can produce a list of all words in the texts with any desired sequence of letters. Of course this does not yield any information that was not available earlier by counting, but it saves considerable time."[(Ed.), Anders Ahlqvist *Papers from the 5th International Conference on Historical Linguistics, Galway, April 6–10 1981*. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1982.]

14. " EXPRESSION AND CONTENT � 59  i   contains in itself an expression-form and a content-form. The    first stage of the analysis of a text must therefore be an analysis I  into these two entities. To be exhaustive, the analysis must be  so organized that at each stage we analyze into the parts that    i. e. , of  lowest number, either within  are of greatest extension,  the analyzed chain in its totality or within any arbitrary section    of it. If a text, for example, includesboth sentences and clauses,  we can show that the number of clauses  is greater than the nummust not proceed directly to an  ber of sentences; therefore we  analysis into clauses, but first analyze into sentences and then  analyze the sentences into clauses."[INPUT: Hjelmslev__Prolegomena_to_A_Theory_of_Language.pdf]

15. "It is also accepted that the discourse structure can be exploited in different natural language processing applications, such as summarisation, machine translation, natural language generation. Thus, research has been carried out to produce systems that automatically chunk discourse into segments and assign them labels according to some theory of discourse acts, the discourse parsers. Many of these attempts have been based on the recognition of the internal structure of discourse (see Kurohashi & Nagao 1994; Asher Lascarides 1993), but they failed to produce reliable results, especially with real texts."[Van Sterkenburg, P.
