    <pre>FLOOR. . . staking the claim of civilization on the raw ground, encoding usage and assuming decoration, the floor then accrues complexity in its section while simplifying its surface details. The textural details of previous occupants are kept intact. Featureless and soundless except for sneakers, which squeak on it.

Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor.
