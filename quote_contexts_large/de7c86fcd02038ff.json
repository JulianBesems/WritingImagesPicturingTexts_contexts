As such the communications (plans, sections, scale models) are not mediated by the comprehension of the designers but by the singular definition of the design within the computational model. This results in a compulsory simplicity that through ever more added details gives the suggestion of complexity. The broader complexity of architecture provided by its inherent multi-facetted nature as identified by Vitruvius when talking about the education of the architect - *\u201cLet him be educated, skilful with the pencil, instructed in geometry, know much history, have followed the philosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of medicine, know the opinions of the jurists, and be acquainted with astronomy and the theory of the heavens.\u201d*- is however absent in this manner of encoding the architectural project. This approach does not allow for the integration of the theoretical, cultural, literary, atmospheric, philosophical and associative dimensions of architectural design or for the flexibility of the design as an idea when mediated by the designer."}
