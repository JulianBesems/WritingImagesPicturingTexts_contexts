It suggests that the design process can be understood as a quest for a universal form that underlies all architectural projects, a form that is capable of generating an infinite number of well-formed buildings. This form would be the architect's ultimate tool for creating order and meaning in the built environment. However, this dream of a total system of relations, where form mediates between all aspects of architecture, has not yet been fully realized.  The CAD model and the BIM model, powerful as they are, remain limited in their ability to capture the complexities of architectural meaning.  They are still bound by the constraints of geometric representation and the rigidity of parametric rules.  The soft and operative dimensions of architecture, its narratives, atmospheres, and mis-readings, continue to elude their grasp.  Nevertheless, the idea of a universal form, a form that underlies all architectural projects, remains a powerful and enduring ideal in architectural theory and practice.  It is an idea that continues to inspire architects to push the boundaries of their craft, to seek new ways of giving form to intent, function, structure, and technics.  And it is an idea that continues to inform the development of new digital tools and technologies, tools", "suggest_context": "Whatever we call a digital architectural instrument should therefore be able to register and work with such conversations and projections, not only with their geometrical traces. Language Games In all these cases, geometry is necessary but not sufficient. The CAD model can specify the grid of columns in Berlin, the slope of the Kunsthal ramps, the modularity of metabolist pods. But their architectural status depends on operations that exceed geometric representation: disciplinary memory, material and cultural referencing, choreographies of movement, political ideology, economic registers, integration of art and building, the slow inscription of use and discourse. A BIM model can host tags and metadata about these things; it cannot encode their interplay. The soft and operative dimensions of architecture, its narratives, atmospheres, and mis-readings, behave more like open-ended language-games than like closed geometric objects. At the same time, we cannot ignore that form plays a central role in architecture as a whole, including in the manifestation of the aspects beyond geometry discussed above. For an architects account of architectures inherent relation to form, we turn to Eisenman. In his early essay Towards an Understanding of Form in Architecture, he argues that formal considerations are basic to all architecture regardless of style and that they alone can help develop an agreed language both for criticism and for design. Architecture, for him, is in essence the giving of form  to intent, function, structure, and technics, with form occupying a position of primacy in the hierarchy of elements. He distinguishes a generic form, close to a Platonic or structural template, from specific form, the concrete configuration that realises a particular intent and function. In this model, the architectural object is a legible resolution of a deeper, more abstract order. Read against the context of the 1960s, Eisenmans position resonates with structural linguistics and early generative grammar: a finite deep structure generates infinitely many well-formed sentences. Generic form plays the role of such a deep structure; specific buildings are its instantiations. The promise is that architecture can be articulated as a total system of relations, with form as the all-encompassing code that mediates between intent, function, structure and technics. From this perspective it is tempting to imagine that a fully detailed 3D model, together with its parametric rules, layers and schedules, could serve as a sufficient encoding of an architectures essence. Jorge Orozco Esquivel underlines this ambition when he notes that Eisenman seeks an architectural logic based on form, where the giving of form is far more than the making of shapes and becomes a way of presenting order at both building and environmental scales. In Orozco's reading, Eisenmans synthesis of intentfunction and structuretechnics addresses both the ideal and the real, the generic and the specific, the semantic definitions and symbolisations through which architecture communicates. Form is not mere appearance; it is the medium through which architecture as a whole is encoded and made communicable."}
