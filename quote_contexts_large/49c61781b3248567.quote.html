      <li>&quot;Not everyone might try to enter a labyrinth or return unharmed from one; to enter it was equivalent to an initiation. The “centre” might be one of a variety of things.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The gate too would be the natural place for transactions between citizens and outsiders. Appropriating places at doorways Doorway places are not always so formally incorporated into the architecture of an entrance.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The shrine consisted of a long room, with its principle entrance on one side, and the cult-focus on the distant short side. For example, in the temple of Anu at Warka, once one has entered, and in order to orient oneself toward the deity, one must make a ninety degree turn to face the altar.&quot;[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The name of the gateway is written above it: “Moment”. ’ Nietzsche (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 1883. trans. Hollingdale) Informal Occupation of Doorways Like the old man in Borges’s story, and notwithstanding Mongolian superstitions, we all find ourselves at one time or another occupying a doorway, on the step between one place and another.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Earlier temples had been small and hardly distinguishable from houses. In fact the functional requirement in thetemple of a normal Greek cult was easily satisfied; it was not a place for congregational worship, since the animal sacrifices which formed the major part of the ritual took place at the altar outside.&quot;[Raeburn, Michael, and Hugh Carson *Architecture of The Western World*. Crescent Books, 1984.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is not just a different place, but a place that no longer exists at all. Our primitive psyches were not wired for that knowledge. Where once existed a familiar home, favorite shop, or longtime office, a place whose microcosm of geography we could easily and comfortably navigate (it’s out the door, down the hall, on the left. . . ), now there is a void.&quot;[Skrdla, Harry *Ghostly Ruins: America&#x27;s Forgotten Architecture*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;The stakes were high, but it is not clear that ‘winning’ would always have been the aim. 21 1 2 A 1 Elevation 2 Section A-A 3 Plan N 0 10 20 20 m 40 60 ft 3 A Culture-Defining Monuments 22 Great Stupa of Sanchi Bhopal, India; 300 bce A stupa is a mound commemorating the place where a significant event took place or where holy relics were kept.&quot;[Ballantyne, Andrew *Key buildings from prehistory to the present : plans, sections and elevations*. Har/Cdr. London: Laurence King Publishing, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;There should be two centres: an external one (the courtyard); and an internal one (living space for the family).&quot;[Edwards, Brian *Courtyard Housing*. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Nylon See Plastic Nympheum A Classical building or room with a fountain, statues, and plants; a place for relaxation. O o Oak See Wood Obata, Gyo (1923–) Partner in the firm of Hellmuth Obata and Kassabaum, noted for the Chapel Priory of St. Mary, St. Louis, MO (1962); the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC (1976); the renovation of Union Station, St. Louis, MO (1985), and the Dallas/Ft.&quot;[Ernest., Burden *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Only in a hut of one’s own can a person follow his or her own desires—a rigorous discipline, and one that the poet Gary Snyder calls the hardest of all, presupposing as it does self-knowledge while balancing free action and cultural taboo, knowing whether a desire is instinctive or the imprint of culture, or if personal, whether such desires are the product of thought, of contemplation, or of the unconscious. 18 Even if this hut is only one’s normal abode inhabited in a different way, here in a hut of one’s own, a person may find one’s very own self, the source of humanity’s song.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;This linked the social context to Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s ideal of &#x27;One thing instead of many things a collection of small ones&#x27;. &#x27;In ; a great thing instead of organic architecture&#x27;, Wright goes on, &#x27;it is quite impossible to consider the building as one thing, its furnishings another. &#x27;&quot;[McCorquodale, Charles *The History of Interior Decoration*. Phaidon Press, 1988.]</li>
<li>&quot;Once hesitancy has been resolved and one turns left to the church proper, another manipulation of spaces begins, for one enters behind the chancel at a half-level below the nave floor via a “cloister,” or ambulatory, which allows glimpses of the auditorium while permitting latecomers to enter without disturbing others.&quot;[Smith, George Everard Kidder *Source Book of American Architecture: 500 Notable Buildings from the 10th Century to the Present*. Princeton Architectural Press, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;Basically, once one has decided to move beyond a style-critical and morphological assessment, one has to try to come up with a satisfactory answer to the following questions: why did that commissioner, at that time, choose for this building, while he could have chosen a completely different one?&quot;[Mekking, Aart J.J., and Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;This hearth became a social place, a place of community and of rite and ritual. In Vitruvius’ account, this deliberate assembly of people prompted the invention of language (II. I. 1).&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*. McFarland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;SC I think the point where I begin a painting is the point where traditional landscape painting leaves off. I am interested in working SC I do not want to depict architecture or expect it to play a role in an unfolding narrative.&quot;[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]</li>
