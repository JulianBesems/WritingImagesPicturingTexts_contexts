<li>&quot;In the preceding discussion what was modified was the object of the prediction— the occurrence. For we related the occurrences not to the directly given sense world, but to an artificially created 1 4 5 world picture, and we thus found it possible to determine occurrences accurately. But instead of modifying the object of predictions we can alter our notion of the subject of the prediction, that is, of the predicting intellect. For every prediction presupposes somebody who does the predicting. Therefore, in the following discussion we shall direct our attention solely to the predicting subject, and shall consider as the objects of prediction the directly given occurrences of the sense world, without introducing an artificial world picture.&quot;[Planck, Max *Scientific Autobiography And Other Papers*.

<li>&quot;I retain some version of the much-Â�disparaged subject-Â�object distinction in behalf of apprehending an object-Â�thing distinction whose explanatory power lies in the cultural field (and not, that is, in the field of metaphysics or psychoanalysis). After providing a chart of my scheme for describing the thingness of objects—the thing that is the other thing, understood in either a physical or a metaphysical register—I track Heidegger’s repeated approach to the question of the thing (in its autonomous being).&quot;[Brown, Bill *Other Things*. University Of Chicago Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;We can speak intelligibly about something being an object only in so far as it can be presented as such to a subject. And in so far as it is presented, it must satisfy the most fundamental conditionsÂ€– namely, having temporal and spatial coordinates and being causally related to other objects or eventsÂ€– for something to be an object for that subject. The weaker view makes no reference to the non-existence of unperceived objects. The onus, rather, is on what can count as an object. We can now understand better the role time plays in the overall design of Schopenhauer’s system.&quot;[Hammer, Espen *Philosophy and Temporality from Kant to Critical Theory*. Cambridge University Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;(Stachel 2002, 249) One difficulty in understanding this proposal comes from Stachel’s use of the term “model. ” If this is a thesis only about models—that is, that which is used to represent the world—then it is hard to see how it could be supported by GP, a thesis about the relation between models and the world. If, however, we take the proposal to concern particles and space-time points themselves, the proposal suggests that such objects are structurally individuated. The intuitive idea here seems to be that models related by permutation attribute the same structure to the world, and hence, if objects are picked out by that structure, these models attribute the same properties to the same objects.&quot;[Guay, Alexandre, and Thomas Pradeu (eds.) *Individuals Across the Sciences*. Oxford University Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;The potentially lethal machines and apparatus produced by this technological viewpoint emerge as a subsidiary effect, set into motion by the redefinition of man in rational terms that affirms through representation his mastery of nature and the world. The second characteristic of representation as a new theory of the world is thus revealed. By forcing and framing the world into a particular order, this mathematical rhetorical demand reduces the world to an object that has the character of a picture.&quot;[Silverman, Hugh J. *Postmodernism and Continental Philosophy*. State University of New York Press, 1988.]</li>
<li>&quot;Consider the very simple case of a world with two exactly similar material objects: clearly, such a world exhibits twice the mass of a world with only one such object. Generalizing from this type of thought-experimental scenarios, it seems right to claim that the naturalist, aiming to only formulate scientifically grounded metaphysical claims, need not, and should not, take indiscernibility as a criterion of individuation for objects but, rather, for worlds.&quot;[Guay, Alexandre, and Thomas Pradeu (eds.) *Individuals Across the Sciences*. Oxford University Press, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;This does not foreclose the possibility that there are moments when the thing about an object seems to name the object’s inherent strangeness, though I consider the assessment of strangeness as such to be a judgment made by a subject (individual or collective, unhuman or human). As the fields of history and anthropology have demonstrated, what is weird for one culture may be the norm for another. Although in this book I spend very little time engaging the new metaphysics (or speculative realism) that focuses on objects and things, particular points often resonate, as when Tristan Garcia argues that “reductionism consists in refusing to consider the irreducibility of a what which is a thing to that which 311 312 Notes to Introduction to Part One and Chapter 2 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 it is. ” Form and Object: A Treatise on Things, trans.&quot;[Brown, Bill *Other Things*. University Of Chicago Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Now, returning to the analysis of the object which we called &#x27;pencil&#x27;, we observe that, in spite of all &#x27;similarities&#x27;, this object is unique, is different from anything else, and has a unique relationship to the rest of the world. Hence, we should give the object a unique name. Fortunately, we have already become acquainted with the way mathema- t icians manufacture an endless array of individual names without unduly expanding the vocabulary. If we call the given object &#x27;pencili&#x27;, we could call another similar object &#x27;pencil2&#x27;,.&quot;[Korzybski, Alfred *Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics*. 5th. Institute of General Semantics, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;Nonetheless, as Alfred North Whitehead emphasized, the subject-Â�object relation may pattern experience, but “subject and object are relative terms,” and the relation must not be regarded as the structure of knower to known. This is because “experience is an activity” and the “basis of experience is emotional”: “The occasion as subject has a ‘concern’ for the object,” he argues; “the ‘concern’ at once places the object as a component in the experience of the subject. ”6 If the perennially demonized subject-Â�object distinction was a defining feature of modern thought (the thought of Descartes, say), then it remains difficult not to admit (however reluctantly) that this is a modernity that we continue to inhabit.&quot;[Brown, Bill *Other Things*. University Of Chicago Press, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Of most importance for us is the phenomenological stage. For Husserl, one of the major issues in this discipline was that mental representations of any type of object had to provide a set of expectations (i. e. a context) for structuring incoming data. If expecting a car to be the next object, we expect that it will have certain default attributes e. g. an internal combustion engine, four wheels, doors. These default assignments Husserl called the “predelineations”: the object at the top level he expected to be invariably the same, even if certain of the default assignments turned out incorrect (an invalid’s threewheeled vehicle is still a car).&quot;[Nuallain, Sean O *The Search for Mind. A New Foundation for Cognitive Science*. 2nd. Intellect (UK), 2000.]</li>
<li>&quot;Here we find the age old and necessary, on this early level, identification of the ordinary object with the scientific object. This form of identification is extremely common even in 1933, and, to a large extent, responsible for our low development, because, no matter what we &#x27;think&#x27; or feel about an object, an object represents only an abstraction of low order, only a general symbol for the scientific object, which remains the only possible survival concern of the organism. But, obviously, such identification, being false to facts, can never be entirely reliable.&quot;[Korzybski, Alfred *Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics*. 5th. Institute of General Semantics, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;This assumption is actually valid in certain situations, as when the agent is a computer program that interacts only with other computer programs and not with the world outside the computer. Normally, though, simply expressing the continuing identity of an object does not suffice to keep track of the object in a 248 Computation and human experience causal sense. Sometimes it is imagined, somewhat more reasonably, that the agent stores a set of spatial coordinates for each such object, updating the stored values each time any fresh knowledge about the object&#x27;s whereabouts becomes available, as part of the general process of maintaining an objective world model.&quot;[Agre, Philip E. *Computation and Human Experience*. Cambridge University Press, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;Object recognition, for example, involves processing information about many different aspects of an object in many different parts of the brain. In recognizing a cup of coffee as a unified object, for example, we must process the feel of its weight, the texture of its surface, the curve and shape of the cup, the colors, the handle and its fit with the human action of grasping, the taste and smell of the coffee. These aspects are “apprehended and processed differently in anatomically different locations, and there is no single site in the brain where the various apprehensions are brought together. ” While we can refer to neural networks, neuroscience cannot yet fully explain how the coffee cup is regarded as a unified object.&quot;[Gosetti-Ferencei, Jennifer Anna *The Life of Imagination: Revealing and Making the World*. New York City: Columbia University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;Perhaps the skill of making and testing such interpretations can help get at the essence of activity in the world. 11 Representation and indexicality World models As an agent gets along in the world, its actions are plainly about the world in some sense. In picking up a cup, I am not just extending my forearm and adjusting my fingers: those movements can be parsimoniously described only in relation to the cup and the ways that cups are used.&quot;[Agre, Philip E. *Computation and Human Experience*. Cambridge University Press, 1997.]</li>
