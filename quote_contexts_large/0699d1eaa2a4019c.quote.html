      <li>&quot;For example, the Oxford English Dictionary has accumulated a great mass of valuable data but presents it in an entirely atheoretical manner, producing a jungle with no paths leading from A to B, no clear signposts, and no consistent system of semantic analysis that would allow either insiders or outsiders to ﬁnd their way. By contrast, the approach taken in this book follows the way of the bee in that it gives close attention to the meanings of words gathered from the gardens of literature and modern linguistic corpora and then transforms them by means of a coherent semantic methodology—NSM.&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*.

<li>&quot;Perhaps switching from conjunction to composition will help. The idea is this: way wgs is a complex way that is composed from ways wg and ws; because of this, when a visual experience occurs in way wgs it follows that it occurs in ways wg and ws; and just because a visual experience occurs in ways wg and ws it does not follow that it occurs in way wgs, because it does not follow that wg and ws compose in this case to form wgs. Let’s call this theory ‘Sum’: Sum. wgs is the mereological sum of wg and ws (i. e.&quot;[Breckenridge, Wylie *Visual Experience: A Semantic Approach*. Oxford University Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;Here the problems start, for ( 19) would also qualify as a description of a situation in which Suehas the impressionof seeinga blue squareand a red circle. One way to cope with this is to use compound adverbs such as &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; square-bluely and square-redly (supplied with adequate logical principles to take care of the relations betweensuch compounds and their constituents ). That would allow one to discriminate between the following two possibilities: (20) Sue seessquare-redly and circle-bluely. (21) Sue seessquare-bluely and circle-redly.&quot;[Casati, Roberto, and Achille C. Varzi *Holes and Other Superficialities (Bradford Books)*. 1995.]</li>

<li>&quot;(Here and in the rest of this section I draw upon the very helpful discussion in Tye (1984), pp. 207–9. )According to Conjunction, someone can have a visual experience that is occurring in way wg and a visual experience that is occurring in way ws without having a visual experience that is occurring in way wgs, because in such cases she has two simultaneous visual experiences—one that is occurring in way wg and one that is occurring in way ws. This is plausible only if in such cases there are two things involved that we can use to individuate the visual experiences in a principled way.&quot;[Breckenridge, Wylie *Visual Experience: A Semantic Approach*.

<li>&quot;17- 29; seealso Antony Quinton , &quot; Matter and Space,&quot; Mind 73 ( 1964), &#x27; pp. 332- 352). Note that Sanford s thesis is stronger than the one according to which two individuals can occupy the same spatio-temporal region: such two individuals could be categorially distinct (say the statue and the piece of marble), whereasin Sanford&#x27; s casethey are categorially homogeneous(they are both solid bodies). Sanford also defines the notion of a material plane: a sort of two -dimensional solid which has no volume and is neverthelesscausally interactive.&quot;[Casati, Roberto, and Achille C.

<li>&quot;As we remarked in commenting on that figure, in generalthe topology of the object is not sufficiently fine-grained to allow a proper distinction betweenobjects having different holes. In this respect, object topology is far inferior to common-sensereasoning, which provides a clear and soundjudgment as to the nature and the variety of the tunnels of figure 4. 14. Consider for instance the two objects reproduced in figure 5. 17. Common senseand ordinary perception definitely say that in a there are two tunnels, each with two mouths, while in b there is only one tunnel: a ramified tunnel, with three mouths (IX, . 8, &#x27;)I).&quot;[Casati, Roberto, and Achille C.

<li>&quot;In many situations Globish may be a more feasible communication tool than normal English, but it is still, to some extent, a vehicle of culture—in particular, Anglo culture. The invisible cultural legacy of English is hidden in the meaning of many Globish words. By contrast, the NSM minilexicon of sixty-three words that have matching semantic counterparts in all languages is independent of any one speciﬁc culture. To demonstrate NSM methodology, I propose two explications: one of the French word empirique and one of the English word empirical (in the English version of NSM, which closely matches the French version).&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*. Oxford, Toronto: Oxford University Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;This book focuses on three aspects of this enduring heritage of British empiricism linked with three key English words: experience, evidence, and sense (all of which have, as it happens, false friends, des faux amis, in French: experience, evidence, and sens). In his classic text, An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense, Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid wrote: “Wise men now agree, or ought to agree in this, that there is but one way to the knowledge of nature’s works; the way of observation and experiment” (Reid 1997 [1764], 11).&quot;[Wierzbicka, Anna *Experience, evidence, and sense : the hidden cultural legacy of English*.

<li>&quot;A second consequence is the mutually constitutive nature of individual experiential nodes and a network of movement possibilities as a whole (i. e. , conception). It is a dialectical relation characterized by a situation where the whole is present in each of its part: “The two sides of the relation entirely interiorize the other in a way that from now on the two are identical in their difference” (Sève, 2005, pp. 131–132). As experiments with computer models of such networks show, strong (experience-based) inputs will draw the entire network to a state corresponding to one conception (category) rather than to other possible conceptions.&quot;[Roth, Wolff-Michael *Geometry as Objective Science in Elementary School Classrooms: Mathematics in the Flesh*.

<li>&quot;I take a paper book of what size I please. I divide the two first pages that face one another by parallel lines into five and twenty equal parts, every fifth line black, the other red. I then cut them perpendicularly by other lines that I draw from the top to the bottom of the page, as you may see in the table prefixed. I put about the middle of each five spaces one of the twenty letters I design to make use of, and, a little forward in each space, the five vowels, one below another, in their natural order.&quot;[Locke, John *Complete Works of John Locke*.

<li>&quot;Alpha concerning dialectic. + 7 8 9 10 See, e. g. , Barnes (1975; 1980, 495), and Frede (1987, 95). Irwin (1988), following Owen’s lead (1961), presents one such account, distinguishing between an earlier, weaker conception of dialectic termed “ordinary” dialectic and a later, stronger one, termed “strong” dialectic, which is useful to scientific inquiry. On pairing dialectic with the developmental approach, see Owen (1961), Irwin (1988), and recently, Berti (1996) and Witt (1996).&quot;[Ward, Julie K. *Aristotle on Homonymy: Dialectic and Science*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Note, by the way, that here already 43 King (1950) 88. CONCEPTIONS OF TOPOS IN ARISTOTLE 141 Aristotle seems to imply that only one of these candidates can in the end turn out to be the right one. 44 Next, from 211 b 10 onward, Aristotle considers the four candidates one by one. In the course of this investigation the third possibility is said to derive its plausibility from the fact that we are inclined to imagine that in the case of a vessel there is something, an extension, which remains when we take away the actual content of the vessel (e. g.&quot;[Algra, Keimpe *Concepts of space in Greek thought*.

<li>&quot;This dimension of having-been, however, has itself been seen to condition all appearing insofar as memory cooperates with φαντάσματα in order to translate what is encountered in perceiving to thinking. 83 This dimension of having-been is reaffirmed by the imperfect ἦν in the expression 83 pair in wedlock. Yet the two that become one here can be thought only through the encounter with the one, which appears precisely not as two, but as one. Any attempt to trace the being of this one to a more original two is a kind of abstraction.&quot;[Long, Christopher P. *Aristotle on the Nature of Truth*. Cambridge University Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Presentation of English equivalents differed greatly from the traditional approach. It happens very rarely that one English equivalent fits every context. Instead of one or two equivalents traditionally found in bilingual dictionaries, this Dictionary offered equivalents for many potential contexts. My aim was to avoid the all-too-familiar impasse experienced when a word or phrase can be easily found on the left side of a bilingual dictionary, but its equivalent on the right side simply cannot be squeezed into a given context.&quot;[Lubensky, Sophia *Russian-English Dictionary of Idioms, Revised Edition*.
