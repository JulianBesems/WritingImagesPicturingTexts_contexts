    <div class="selected">We’d left Japan so abruptly that I had completely forgotten to bring any books. I read two novels I’d picked up at the airport, and a copy of Aeschylus’ tragedies Izumi had brought along. I read them all twice. To cater to tourists, the kiosk at the harbor stocked a few English paperbacks, but nothing caught my eye. Reading was my passion, and I’d always imagined that if I had free time I’d wallow in books, but, ironically, here I was—with all the time in the world and nothing to read. Izumi started studying Greek.[Murakami, Haruki *Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman*. Vintage, 2007.]</div>

      <li>&quot;When I crossed the street by the bank, the clock read exactly 9:20. • • • The next day, Friday, felt like a new era. Hannah had exams all day so I sat in our common room, working on my philosophy paper about action sentences. Nobody knew how to put action sentences into logic notation. Donald Davidson thought the action was an invisible extra thing, hiding in the sentence. He thought you had to call it “x. ” I read and reread the examples. I flew my spaceship to the Morning Star. ( x) (Flew (I, my spaceship, x) &amp; (to the Morning Star, x)) Did spaceships even work that way?&quot;[Batuman, Elif *The Idiot*. Penguin Press, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Here&#x27;s a smear for instance of the remains of my raspberry tart: Síle. P. S. Happy Valentine&#x27;s Day. Struggling to decipher the crazy handwriting, Jude&#x27;s first impression of this letter was that it was indeed written to kill half an hour. And was that &quot;Kathleen (my girlfriend)&quot; as in friend or as in . . . On the second reading, she paid more attention to the bits about waiting six weeks and a struggle of wills, and the pointed reference to Valentine&#x27;s Day. It must have taken quite a while to copy by hand.&quot;[Donoghue, Emma *Landing*. Reprint. Mariner Books, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;I took out my notebook and pen and started to write. The words seemed to flow on to the page as easily as the river ran downstream. I like to just jot down whatever comes to me, not worrying whether it makes sense or not, and then work on it later. I read the words I’d just written, knowing that they were far from perfect, but knowing too that they reflected my feelings so, if nothing else, they were certainly honest. When I thought about the last song I’d written it seemed like a lifetime ago. So much in my life had changed since then.&quot;[Cassidy, Laura Jane *Angel Kiss. Laura Jane Cassidy*. Razorbill, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Junpei stuck close to home, waiting for word from Kirie, but nothing ever came. A month went by. One month became two, and two became three. The season changed to winter, and a new year began. His story came out in the February issue of a literary magazine. A newspaper ad for the magazine listed Junpei’s name and the title, “The Kidney-Shaped Stone That Moves Every Day. ” Kirie might see the ad, buy the magazine, read the story, and call him to share her impressions—or so he hoped.&quot;[Murakami, Haruki *Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman*. Vintage, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;432 Could I have been different than I was?Nonsense, I thought!1 had become what Fd chosen to become. The world where time was rigidly partitioned into hours was far away. 1 sat in that cellar and read hundreds of those letters. Then, to my surprise, I found, buried in the business correspondence, two letters to my father from myself, written during the winter of my second year at college. Dear Pop: (went the first) Thank you for your present. I have to admit I was surprised. But it made me awfully happy to get it I’m sure glad you had that good day at the races.&quot;[Kazan, Elia *The Arrangement*. New York: Avon Books, 1968.]</li>
<li>&quot;Bukowski?Burroughs?Hunter Thompson?Gimme a break. I was the best. I wrote almost nothing but record reviews, and not many of those. …” He was half-kidding until the parenthesis began (he never closed it); then he was telling the truth. Perhaps what this book demands from a reader is a willingness to accept that the best writer in America could write almost nothing but record reviews. I don’t really know about the claims preceding the parenthesis. Like thousands of other people, I knew Lester mostly through his writing.&quot;[Bangs, Lester, and Greil Marcus (editor) *Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung: The Work of a Legendary Critic: Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Roll as Literature and Literature as Rock &#x27;N&#x27;Roll*.

<li>&quot;Tomorrow. Tomorrow . . . That night she went to bed at nine o’clock so that she would lookfine in the^rnoming, but she could not sleep. Perhaps he won’t cometomorrow, she was thinking; perhaps it will be the next day. Can Ibear it, to wait another day?I ve waited so long already. But sheknew that she would wait the day if necessary, or another week, or 383 any time, since nothing could be so long as these sleepless hours inthe last, anticipatory night.&quot;[Jaffe, Rona *The Best of Everything*. Penguin Books, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;We chose it to end our book this year. It is the longest story in this book and, perhaps, even, the best. What a ﬁne year when stories of this quality contend for best!This is what William Wachter wrote in his spiral notebook during study hall, the ﬁrst day. “Funny dream last night. I was standing on a beach. I looked out, shading my eyes, and I could not see a thing. It was like a big fog bank was over the ocean way far away so that everything sort of faded white. A gull ﬂew over me and screeched, and I thought, well, not that way.&quot;[Hartwell, DG, and K Cramer *Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy 5*. Eos, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;She often felt like one possessed during these creative afternoons. “Cracks”, Aditi’s first story, had appeared in Hemen’s magazine last month. All the uncertainty that had once made her so jittery had disappeared for good. Her first story had been a distinct hit. Hemen Mamas circle of critics was a fairly large one. He had insisted on their reading her story. Nearly all of them agreed that it didn’t read like a first attempt. The language was mature, the treatment showed depth of understanding and what was most important, it led to a smooth climax.&quot;[Bhattacharya, Suchitra *Hemanter Pakhi*. Srishti, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;I was aching for Abhi. It was a longing which I had not allowed myself to feel. I did not know what to do, as I made my way home. Then I felt that writing to Suvi would help. I took out the new stationery I had bought. I began writing. Words poured out like a flood. I wrote about meeting Abhi that last day, I wrote about the time during the youth festival when Abhi and I had first kissed, I wrote about the waterfall that I had just painted. I wrote about every little detail that I could remember about Abhi.&quot;[Shenoy, Preeti *Life is What You Make it: A Story of Love, Hope and How Determination Can Overcome Even Destiny*. westland, 2014.]</li>

<li>&quot;I read. I read all the time. I read books that tell the pure honest truth. Over there in my suitcase I have books by Karl Marx and Thorstein Veblen and such writers as them. I read them over and over, and the more I study the madder I get. I know every word printed on every page. To begin with I like words. Dialectic materialism—Jesuitical prevarication&#x27;— Jake rolled the syllables 59 in his mouth with loving solemnity—&#x27;teleological propensity. &#x27;&quot;[McCullers, Carson *The Heart is a Lonely Hunter*.

<li>&quot;Luckily, I had a notebook, and I wrote this story at my little hotel desk. By the time the sun came up, it was done and I was able to sleep for another couple of hours. A story should entertain the writer, too—that’s my opinion, we welcome yours. “Mute” I read a story in my local newspaper about a high school secretary who embezzled over sixty-five thousand dollars in order to play the lottery. My first question was how her husband felt about that, and I wrote this story to find out.&quot;[King, Stephen *Just After Sunset: Stories*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;I might not be able to sing on key, but maybe one day I could write a character who was an opera singer or a rock singer, beset by trials and tribulations but finding love where and when it mattered most. Best of all, if I were a writer, I could write my own endings, whether I was in the mood for tragedy or joy. I could kill those who deserved to be killed, I could kill those I loved best in my fictional worlds just for the sake of creating great drama, I could love without fear.&quot;[Baratz-Logsted, Lauren *How Nancy Drew Saved My Life*. 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;I never knew that spring could be so painful and lonely. Better to have three Februaries than a spring like this. I know it&#x27;s too late to be saying this, but your new hairstyle looks great on you. Really cute. I&#x27;m working at an Italian restaurant now, and the cook taught me a great way to make spaghetti. I&#x27;d like to make it for you soon. I went to the university every day, worked in the restaurant two or three times a week, talked with Itoh about books and music, read a few Boris Vian novels he lent me, wrote letters, played with Seagull, made spaghetti, worked in the garden, masturbated thinking of Naoko, and saw lots of films.&quot;[Murakami, Haruki *Norwegian Wood*.

To-day tis hot and We half been Working at the Corn all day Hoing Wedes. Thomas put the diary away again. This was not glamorous war history. This was boring farmer talk. Besides, the churning in his stomach made it impossible for him to concentrate. Though he hadn’t mentioned it to his mother, or to anyone else, he was desperately afraid, and though home was barely behind him, he was already lonely.&quot;[Kowalski, William *Eddie&#x27;s Bastard: A Novel*. 2000.]</li>

<li>&quot;She thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it. When it came to letters and literature, Madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem: namely, clarity. The week after they read Eco, they read portions of Derrida’s Writing and Difference. The week after that, they read Jonathan Culler’s On Deconstruction, and Madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time. Before she could do so, however, Thurston beat her to it.&quot;[Eugenides, Jeffrey *The Marriage Plot*. HarperCollins Publishers, 2011.]</li>

<li>&quot;Anyway, I reckoned, the parts of the concent that were most interesting to her were those that concerned the Ita, and, in a sense, she had access to that all the time because she made stuff for them. On any given day of Apert I could have written an entire book about what I was thinking and feeling, and it would have been completely different from the previous day’s book. But by the end of the eighth day, the thing had been settled in such a way that I can sum it up much more briefly.&quot;[Stephenson, Neal. *Anathem*. Atlantic Books. 1 Cloth(s), 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;I was fascinated. We spent the first class getting to know one another, talking about what we liked to read and what we hoped to write and who we were. Conversations like children imagine grown-ups having. Frederick liked Less Than Zero—“Well, who doesn’t?” I said. I hadn’t read it yet—and wanted to write something real, raw, poetic. I was into John Cheever and wanted to write short stories. “I like your hair, Frederick,” said one of the North County girls. “You look like that guy from Simply Red. ” And he did.&quot;[Holmes, Dave *Party of One: A Memoir in 21 Songs*. Crown Archetype, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;He was lucky. ” “No he wasn’t!” I said. “They must have seemed so boring and repetitive, when she read them all in a row like that. One day at a time it would be much less boring. ” “Hmm,” said Ivan. “You’ve got a point. Reading ninety cards in one day is different from reading one card per day for ninety days. ” He leaned back in his chair and stared into space, apparently satisfied with the conclusion we had reached. “So what happened in the end?” I asked. “Hmm?” “With your roommate and the girl. ” “Oh—nothing. ” “Nothing?” “Well, they met, they took a long walk, there was some kind of a river, or maybe it was a moon.&quot;[Batuman, Elif *The Idiot*.

<li>&quot;It could hardly be otherwise, with so many families still without a roof. The repairs went on from first light to last, and still many houses and cabins were uninhabitable. It was a new word for Birdie, one she liked. Since the flood she had learned a lot of new words, because when Ma was worried, she started to talk like a book. Other people might babble when they were scared, but Birdie’s ma would talk more slowly, and her sentences got longer, and her words got bigger. Birdie’s list was longer every day: chaotic, debris, indestructible (because the schoolhouse had mostly survived), turbulence, and the best of all: Mesopotamian and aqueduct.&quot;[Donati, Sara *The Endless Forest: A Novel*. Reprint. Bantam, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;We’d left Japan so abruptly that I had completely forgotten to bring any books. I read two novels I’d picked up at the airport, and a copy of Aeschylus’ tragedies Izumi had brought along. I read them all twice. To cater to tourists, the kiosk at the harbor stocked a few English paperbacks, but nothing caught my eye. Reading was my passion, and I’d always imagined that if I had free time I’d wallow in books, but, ironically, here I was—with all the time in the world and nothing to read. Izumi started studying Greek.&quot;[Murakami, Haruki *Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman*. Vintage, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;Then I put these pages away, without a sense o f failure, since I hadn’t been writing to interest anyone. I began to work on a story about a college boy, obsessed with hatred of one person, who transfers that hatred to everyone else he meets, revenging himself against them all, and never taking the pleasure o f loving anyone. In time a young girl came into the narration, and she was understanding and patient and finally loving, the first person he allowed to be that way to him. And that all took I don’t know how many months. I didn’t care. I was in no hurry. It was the first time in my life that I didn’t want anything more. I even foreot about my plans to travel. I just did the same old thing every day (as Gwen said to a friend) seven days a week. And Sundays, when the store was closed, was the best day of all, because it was ail mine. I’d never before had the experience I had on certain of those mornings, like I’d been rescued from suffocation, could breathe freely for the first time.&quot;[Kazan, Elia *The Arrangement*.
