<li>&quot;Perhaps considered to be the dirty or untamed element continuous with landscape, the floor  has always been obsessively cleaned -  even scrubbed, polished and made to gleam. In th e PAGE 64 FLOOR 1843 &quot;I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber,  and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards  so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye-not even his-could  have detected any thing wrong. &quot; — Edgar Allen Poe, The Tell-Tale Heart  (illustrated by Daniel Horowitz, 2012) 1521 Vaulted floor, illustrated by Cesare Cesariano,  ready for the introduction of pipes. &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;floor&quot; to prompt or indulge a spectrum of behaviors is perhaps another underexploited power  worth retrieving from a study of architectural elements. section A historical fast-forward through the changing cross-section of the floor would remain steady on  hardened earth for centuries, eventually incorporating aggregates of stone and wooden timbers.  Floors in ancient palaces and temples across all civilizations, paved with every possible stone and  metal, would animate the section slightly. The Greeks introduced beams combining stone and  iron to resist bending. Romans introduced the chemical composite of concrete also occasionally &quot;[INPUT: floor.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;2. 1. Structure To provide a flat, horizontal surface on which desired human activities can take place, all buildings contain at least one floor. In primitive buildings, the ground may be used as the floor. In better buildings, the floor may be a deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist indicated in Fig.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;The primary concern of this text is space planning, not design presentation. Despite this, the language of space planning is the floor plan, and its graphic qualities cannot be entirely ignored. One of the premises of the planning methodology presented here is that the transition from the rough floor plan to the preliminary or presentation floor plan is part of the planning process, not just a graphic refinement.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;The walls are a large “plane. ” The sofa is a large “plane. ” The floor coverings and floor are large planes. My apartment might be a fun example to analyze . . . Our dining room and living room have zany painted floors—a deep beigey color coupled with a crisp white to make a wild, but not too wild, checkerboard floor. The walls pull from the white in the floor—a quiet “plane” in contrast with the “pop” of the painted floors.&quot;[Salway, Christina, and Monica Pedersen *Home improvement projects for the busy &amp; broke: how to get your $h!t together and live like an adult*. Skyhorse Publishing, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;Later in this chapter, there are illustrations of refined rough floor plans employing different drawing methods. Regardless of the drawing method employed, this refinement process presents an opportunity to see the rough floor plan from a fresh vantage point, almost demanding a closer look at the plan details for the first time in the space planning process.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]</li>
<li>&quot;These added drawing elements make for more easily read and communicative floor plans. Consistency in technique and strong communicative drawings are essential to the success of all designers, students and professionals alike. Refining the Rough Plan The development of the rough floor plan, as described in Chapter 6, suggests significant review and evaluation within the plan development process.&quot;[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed.

<li>&quot;At the waiting area, the wood floor pattern breaks the normal long-running board pattern with cross-stitched short boards slowing the visitor down. In the lounge area a brick floor with a simple running bond pattern define the informal dining area. At the kitchen visitors walk on an antiqued hexagonal brick floor. Even in the bathrooms, a carefully considered large stone floor pattern support a larger series of discrete experiences that work overall to quietly engage the visitor into quiet contemplation.&quot;[Du (Editor), Darren *New Art Deco Style*.

<li>&quot;13. I5b). The header in that case should be provided with a rigid cover plate capable of supporting floor loads. For all types of underfloor installation, the floor surface may be covered with usual flooring materials, such as carpet, linoleum or tile. Cellular Metal Floor Raceways. In steelframe buildings with cold-formed steel cellular decking, the cells of the structural deck may conveniently and economically be used as raceways (see Fig.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

<li>&quot;Figure 4 shows that the expressions contained in the seismic provisions of the UBC 1997 and ASCE/SEI 7-10 to determine floor accelerations for the design of nonstructural components are representative of the floor acceleration envelope. The term Ai /Ag represents the amplification of the floor acceleration with respect to the peak ground acceleration, and the term hi /hr represents the floor height divided by the roof height.&quot;[Lynn, Abraham C., and Robert Reitherman *AEI 2011 : building integration solutions : proceedings of the 2011 Architectural Engineering National Conference, March 30-April 2, 2011 Oakland, California*.

<li>&quot;In all cases, a successfully tiled floor relies on proper preparation. That starts with laying down a stable, secure surface for the tile (see pages 70 to 75). But the most important step for the look of the finished floor is snapping the chalk lines and dry-fitting to determine the most visually pleasing tile placement.&quot;[Press, Editors of Cool Springs *Black &amp; Decker Complete Guide to Bathrooms 5th Edition : Dazzling Upgrades &amp; Hardworking Improvements You Can Do Yourself*. 5th ed.

<li>&quot;The table and charts are usually computed by the zonal cavity method. In this method, a room is divided into three horizontal zones, called floor, ceiling and room cavities. 454 Building Engineering and Systems Design The effective reflectance of each cavity is then detennined from the reflectances of the floor and ceiling and from a factor called cavity ratio.&quot;[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.
