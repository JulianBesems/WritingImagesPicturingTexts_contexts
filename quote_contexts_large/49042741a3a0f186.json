Current ML developments have culminated in models that can transform input data to related information, both between domains (e.g. text to image) and within domains (e.g. text to text). These developments are of evident relevance here because they enable continuous interaction. Because of the high complexity, requirement of resources, and the reliance on enormous scale of data of such models, the thesis does not attempt to extend their computational architectures, nor retrain them; instead it focuses on using and connecting existing technologies, using small scale datasets to curate particular kinds of interactions. Their original setup is used, connected, and probed in ways that support the thesis\u2019s architectonic propositions about projection, proportion, and heterogeneity. Their rapid evolution is therefore addressed as context and constraint: it informs what can be staged, but does not determine what counts as an architectural outcome.", "suggested_query": "These connections, in turn, are understood as invitations to explore the tensions between the domains, which are not necessarily compatible with the existing infrastructure. By embracing this complexity, the thesis proposes a new architectural paradigm that redefines the relationship between the domains and the infrastructure, allowing for novel forms of communication and interaction to emerge. This is achieved by using ML methods to project the domains onto each other, creating a constellation of connections that transcend the boundaries between them. The resulting architectonic connection is no longer based on a single explicit function, but rather on the emergent properties of the connections themselves. In this way, the thesis challenges the dominant paradigm of infrastructure as a fixed and predetermined system, and instead proposes a more dynamic and adaptive approach that is capable of responding to the changing needs of the domains. The focus is on creating a space for dialogue and collaboration, where the domains can engage with each other in a way that is both meaningful and productive.", "suggest_context": "This proposes a non-linear model that facilitates the communication between domains, maintaining a proportionality. Focussed on facilitating an understanding. These associations are approached as invitations into conversation. As stated by Valry, as soon as we make a comparison it is not moving and we are not entering the relation between the objects. Comparison communicates through distance, difference, and proximity; it tends to stabilise. Instead of focussing only on what is close and similar, the scope here is to explore a means of association that forms constellations, what Ishigami calls an approachable abstraction. These constellations are treated as indefinite and ambiguous clusters of things that might engage in talks, much like the Kunstkammer as discussed by Horst Bredekamp. Within this context, machine learning ML is approached less as an means of classification or generation, and more as a family of techniques that enable projections within domains and between domains. Examples range from self-organising maps SOM to contemporary textimage systems. Although these projections rest on encoding domains into vectors between which distances can be measured the relations they establish do not behave like a single explicit function that can be written down in advance. Using ML methods, the projection from a domain to a co-domain follows contingent relations established through associations of data. Removing a strictly linear connection between domain and co-domain has the potential to lift the resulting architectonic connection out of geometry onto a communication between non-commensurable fields. This does not mean abandoning geometry; rather it means resisting its monopolisation. It will rely on discerning proportionalities between domains instead of translating them into the same common set, comparable to the proportion between plan and section. These domains in architecture are not the same, nor can they be reduced to one field; they need to stand orthogonal to each other to bear meaning. Within that scope, we treat ML as a non-systematic means of orienting qualitative data: facilitating projections within and between domains that do not follow a pre-declared mathematical function, and thereby tuning indefinite and ambiguous constellations of communication. At the same time, the scope of the thesis is explicitly instrumental rather than model-inventive. Current ML developments have culminated in models that can transform input data to related information, both between domains e.g. text to image and within domains e.g. text to text. These developments are of evident relevance here because they enable continuous interaction.

Their original setup is used, connected, and probed in ways that support the thesiss architectonic propositions about projection, proportion, and heterogeneity. Their rapid evolution is therefore addressed as context and constraint: it informs what can be staged, but does not determine what counts as an architectural outcome."}
