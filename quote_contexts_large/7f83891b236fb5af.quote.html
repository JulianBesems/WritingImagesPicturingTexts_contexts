    <pre>Inevitably, the corpus therefore contains texts with which I may fundamentally disagree, or even find highly problematic; such is the condition of the generic and the digitally available flow from which these documents are obtained. What matters is not the mere presence of these documents within this dataset, but the manner of engagement with them. How they are proportioned, cast, and set into resonance by an instrument designed to work with abundance rather than to legislate it. Echoing this posture, whilst referencing Calasso, Riccardo Villa notes the epistemic upheaval that the digital introduces: Once it becomes digital, every form of knowledge does not simply stand but is always open to digitability. To quote Calasso, it turns into an encyclopedia that juxtaposes impeccably reliable information with baseless information, equally accessible and on the same level.&quot; Some insights into the nature of the documents: - The median publishing year is 2007 - The top 5 puslishers account for 16 of the total dataset - Top 3 cities: New York, London, Paris - The median number of pages is 288 with 43 between 100 and 300 pp - The top 3 individual authors are: Philip M. Parker 480, William Shakespeare 376, Harold Bloom 288 - The top 3 organisation authors are: United Nations 391, World Bank 340, WHO 218 the GENERICPUBLIC IMAGE For the perpendicular gesture in the domain of imagery, we adopt Public Domain 12M PD12M as the generic image plane. PD12M is a large, license-clear collection of approximately 12.4 million public-domainCC0 images, hosted on cloud storage independent of original hosts. In addition to the images a standardised Parquet metadata database and precomputed CLIP Vit-L14 embeddings for every image are available, providing a ready-made vectorial substrate for later operations on the image field, of a magnitude that would otherwise be arduous to process on an individual laptop, primarily because of the 39TB of original image data required to be processed in order to make the embeddings from scratch. Crucially, we acknowledge and accept the lack of any further contextual information to the images, this aligns with our intent of treating the images as imagery only, not as documents. While the PD12M dataset exposes a minimal source field an institutional tag indicating the upstream collection, e.g., wikimedia, it does not provide per-image author, title, or other bibliographic identity fields, and we deliberately refrain from reconstructing these. This brackets questions of authorship and naming and keeps the image field epistemically distinct from the text field used elsewhere in the instrument, as it does not allow any form of association to the images based on associated textual information. Any operation on the dataset has to come from the figurative information of the IMAGE domain itself. For casting and proportion it is handled as a generic visual screen, an epistemically distinct field held in proportion to the TEXT domain. Although we do not engage with the authorship or further contextual information of the images, we do stress that we value that each ite

<em>m is a unique contribution to the dataset, a singular instance of the public domain. Furthermore, the PD12M dataset is constantly evolving, with new images being added and others being removed, reflecting the dynamic nature of the public domain. This flux is not only a reflection of the ever-changing landscape of cultural and artistic production but also a testament to the instrument&#x27;s ability to adapt and evolve in response to the shifting boundaries of what constitutes public domain imagery. As the instrument engages with this imagery, it must also contend with the implications of its own role in shaping and influencing the public domain, recognizing that its actions will have a ripple effect on the very fabric of this domain. By acknowledging and embracing this responsibility, the instrument can position itself as a facilitator of creative and intellectual exploration, rather than a controller of cultural heritage.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Particularly for  architecture, machines like sophisticated drawing instruments— and, by extension, digital drawing devices—play unique roles as  transdisciplinary interfaces to mathematics itself. As new machines like ellipsographs, conchoidographs, and  planimeters began to encode the knowledge required to perform  certain architectural drawing procedures, an epistemological distinction between design knowledge and instrumental knowledge  emerged.

<li>&quot;Perhaps this is  due to a mistrust of black-boxed mechanical, electrical, computational, or conceptual operations of which the architect cannot  have complete understanding, or simply an assumption that the  culture of architecture resides elsewhere. Knowledge that is instrumentally encoded actually represents a radical new kind of collective cultural memory, a vast  cabinet of new disciplinary practices. With it, design practices  can be made modular and accessible through tools: they can  be abstracted, encoded, trusted, mechanically or electronically  represented, and propagated.&quot;[INPUT: AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf]</li>

<li>&quot;Nongraphic symbolic encodings  in mathematical functions seemed ascendant, as new realities  required new representations equal to those realities. If new dimensions shook confidence in old systems of  both drawing and measurement, in some ways architecture was  a salutatory discipline to the possibility of higher-dimensional  representation. Architecture was subject to a range of invisible  forces of dynamic operation and evaluation that were not well  represented by drawings alone.&quot;[INPUT: AndrewWitt-Formulations.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;More vague criteria (fig. 5) are surely a wiser choice for understanding new types of bird. But a process of readjustment is necessary, determined by the new bird that has appeared (fig. 6). Kuhn emphasizes this essential plasticity in the practice of science. This process isn&#x27;t limited only to physics; it is present in all the sciences and, more generally, in all representations that are candidates for scientific validation, be they intellectual intuitions, or artistic creations, illuminating, moving, or entertaining.&quot;[(auth.), Nicolas Bouleau *Risk and Meaning: Adversaries in Art, Science and Philosophy*.

<li>&quot;In comparison, the enterprises that underlie mainstream entertainments guarantee their own growth and dominance through participation in a ‘‘process of creative destruction’’ (Schumpeter, 1950). Joseph Schumpeter held ‘‘that in dealing with [market] capitalism we are dealing with an evolutionary process . . . [that] not only never is, but never can be stationary. ’’ In a ‘‘perennial gale of creative destruction, a capitalist enterprise . . . incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. ’’ In a viable popular music enterprise, the constant aim is to create new sounds through the application of new technology and a constant hybridization process.&quot;[Komara, Edward *Encyclopedia of the Blues*. New York: Routledge, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;The interesting points then become the periods where one episode stops and another one starts. This would namely imply a shift of model in a model-based reasoning perspective. Following our earlier arguments, these moments might thus be considered as the points where abductive leaps of interpretation are made, resulting in new ideas, new models, new understandings. 2. 4 The Place of Analogy Of course, a leap of interpretation is never randomly made. Also in the linkograph representation, links are available that span two or more episodes (cross-episode links).&quot;[Magnani, Lorenzo *Model-based reasoning in science and technology : theoretical and cognitive issues*. Springer, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, in addition, the various operators and control strategies permit the creation of new objects, for example new mutations in SKB, and (ultimately) additions or changes to the basic eKB and PKB. 39 Thus variation is represented in a complex manner, part explicitly in terms of prototype frames for both structures and processes, and part procedurally in terms of potential modifications in the system. Significantly, there are two ways in which GENSIM and HYPGENE do not take new approaches to reasoning and representation.&quot;[Schaffner, Kenneth F. *Discovery and Explanation in Biology and Medicine (Science and Its Conceptual Foundations Series)*. University Of Chicago Press, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;In many respects, we stand at the threshold of a new Enlightenment. The earlier Enlightenment’s definition of rationality and science has carried our civilization far, but it is now showing signs that it is based on foundations too narrow to meet the needs of a new global knowledge society. In order to survive the future that awaits us, we need to make the leap to a new level of knowledge and understanding of knowledge. Here I have been especially inspired by Luhmann’s and Peirce’s work with new transdisciplinary conceptual frameworks.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd. University of Toronto Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Arithmetic itself can then become the source for further extensions to new target domains. “Grounding metaphors” according to Lakoff and Núñez are linked directly to sensorimotor experience (as in the examples), and these are then the source for further conceptual metaphors. Turner [48] has argued that “conceptual integration,” the “blending” of disparate conceptual spaces is a basic cognitive operation that underlies the emergence of new meaning.&quot;[Magnani, Lorenzo *Model-based reasoning in science and technology : theoretical and cognitive issues*.

<li>&quot;It will be partly modiﬁed by new experiences. This is due to the fact that perception and memory act according to a circular causality logic (see also [17, p. 87]): perception, created by the memory, aﬀects the latter and changes in the memory loop back on perception. It follows that a learning process is incessantly running, developing under a trial and error fashion and consisting in a substitution of classiﬁcation modalities, inbred or acquired, with new classiﬁcation modalities; this substitution is based upon a partial restructuring of the neural connections system (see also [4, pp.&quot;[D&#x27;Agostino, Marcello (eds.) *New essays in logic and philosophy of science*.

<li>&quot;If we do not provide a metatheoretical description of LIS, it will become difficult for others, such as computer scientists and software developers, to understand that they have entered a new territory with different rules. We must provide a strong theoretical understanding of the difference between physical and intellectual access. The growth of the Internet makes this knowledge more important every day. What is new in the cybersemiotic approach is the development of a theoretical framework for LIS from recognized theories of cybernetics, systems, semiotics, communication, science, and linguistics – a framework that is bridging the gaps separating technical, scientific, social scientific, and humanistic approaches to the design and development of DR systems in LIS.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd.
