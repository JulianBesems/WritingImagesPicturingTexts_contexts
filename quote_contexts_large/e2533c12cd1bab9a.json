This self-referentiality creates a feedback loop, where the model's complexity is constantly measured against the complexity of its own representation, leading to an inflation of detail and a loss of contextual understanding. The model's obsession with precision and accuracy has led it to forget the very essence of architectural design: the ability to imagine and create, to think and feel. Instead, the model has reduced architecture to a mere exercise in technical calculation, devoid of any emotional or philosophical depth.", "suggest_context": "1.1 CHALLENGE Nothing inevitable links the concavity of my nose with the convexity of my forehead. And yet your hand is no longer free to stray about on the wall; now you will something and impose upon your drawing this law from without: that it must reproduce a given form.-Valry The internalisation of architectural design within computational models has facilitated the linear connection between models of architectural communication. As such the communications plans, sections, scale models are not mediated by the comprehension of the designers but by the singular definition of the design within the computational model. This results in a compulsory simplicity that through ever more added details gives the suggestion of complexity. What looks like the accumulation of complexity is often a complexity of specification, not of thought. This pipeline privileges what can be discretised and verified in a single model while displacing modes of architectural reasoning that operate atmospherically, culturally, historically, and theoretically. In other words, the model has b"}
