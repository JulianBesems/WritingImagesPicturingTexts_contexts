      <li>&quot;Providence has been extended to the Kingdom of Ends. A God of the bottom line; that took some doing . . Â€. After the first Nature, the second nature; after the first supernatural, a second supernatural!&quot;[Latour, Bruno *An Inquiry into Modes of Existence. An Anthropology of the Moderns*. Harvard University Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;In an exterior way at first, by the very &quot;form&quot; of the text: &quot;curse words&quot; are used in the first sentence, as though to provoke the reader. At first you think it can&#x27;t go on, and then it does.&quot;[Deleuze, Gilles *Desert Islands and Other Texts (1953-1974)*. Semiotext(e), 2003.]</li>

Part Two. Interior Design*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;— — HI In trying to spell out these notions in greater detail I shall make three principal points. In the first place, I shall explain why the gloomy vision is in a sense the first stage of any reflections about a backward reality, and shall make a plea for not getting stuck in that stage.&quot;[Rabinow, Paul, and William M. Sullivan *Interpretive Social Science: A Second Look*. 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;Let us start with the first meaning. The subject as “subjectum” highlights notions such as “to be placed below,” “to be put beneath something. ” If we link such a meaning to the question of feelings, then we can say that the subject, in this first form, appears as the “support” or the “base” for feeling, at once set back, placed behind, and what gives them sense.&quot;[Gaskill, Nicholas, A. J. Nocek, and Alfred North Whitehead *The lure of Whitehead*. Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;What are the advantages of going with the flow then?“Because the first must be first,” let us look at poetry. It is now perfectly possible that Miłosz could strike a correspondence with something of the nightingale through the clever use of his unmatched poetry.&quot;[Gaskill, Nicholas, A. J. Nocek, and Alfred North Whitehead *The lure of Whitehead*. Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;(Kant, 1787, p. xiii) The first three lines of this quotation could be a summary of what Eriugena wrote a thousand years earlier. Then, it was intended to show that reason could not encroach on the mystic’s wisdom.&quot;[Glasersfeld, E. *Radical Constructivism: A Way of Learning*. Springer, 1996.]</li>
<li>&quot;Let us consider the ﬁrst case. I annihilate in thought an ex- ternal object: in the place where it was, there is no longer anything. ——-No longer anything of that object, of course, but another object has taken its place: there is no abso- lute void in nature.&quot;[Bergson, Henri *Creative evolution*. Henry Holt &amp; Company, 1924.]</li>
<li>&quot;And whenever the logic of original and copy, first and second, is operative, there, too, is a linear logic of time. Obviously, the first comes before the second, both ontologically and temporally.&quot;[Kochhar-Lindgren, Gray *Technologics: Ghosts, the Incalculable, and the Suspension of Animation (S U N Y Series in Postmodern Culture)*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;At the outside, we have to take the first gift for the model of the second one, and think, we could say, of the second gift as a kind of second first gift.&quot;[Ricoeur, Paul *The Course of Recognition*. Harvard University Press, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Peirce could have developed the example to tell me of a housewife who in a first moment perceives of her 102 / K A N T AND T H E PLATYPUS freshly washed sheet as extremely white but then, after comparing it with another, admits that the second is whiter than the first.&quot;[Eco, Umberto, and Alastair McEwen *Kant and the Platypus: Essays on Language and Cognition*. 2000.]</li>
<li>&quot;At first glance, this is a bizarre claim for Kant to advance. How could practical reason alone possibly involve turning mental representations into reality?&quot;[Stivale, Charles J. *Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;4. The sameidea is very clearlyexpressedin the Gospeltext,&#x27;So the last will be first, and the first last. &#x27;(Matt.&quot;[Guenon, Rene *Man and His Becoming according to the Vedanta (Collected Works of Rene Guenon)*. 3rd ed. Sophia Perennis, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;With these wars, practical hut dwellers reemerged. At first, like Lao Tzu, some sought survival in troubled times, but later some others, like Kamo no Chomei, sought existential closure.&quot;[Cline, Ann *A Hut of One&#x27;s Own: Life Outside the Circle of Architecture*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;It cannot be 58 Of Struction a question of establishing limits for what, in itself, ignores the limit. Either this limitlessness will be self-destructive—a construction that goes up but only to fall down right at the end—or we will find a way to recognize “sense” in struction—at the place where there is neither end, nor means, nor assembly, nor disassembly, nor top, nor bottom, nor east, nor west.&quot;[Barrau, Aurélien, Travis Holloway, Flo Mechain, and Jean-Luc Nancy *What&#x27;s these worlds coming to?*. Fordham University Press, 2015.]</li>
