01. "Figure 4 shows that the expressions contained in the seismic provisions of the UBC 1997 and ASCE/SEI 7-10 to determine floor accelerations for the design of nonstructural components are representative of the floor acceleration envelope. The term Ai /Ag represents the amplification of the floor acceleration with respect to the peak ground acceleration, and the term hi /hr represents the floor height divided by the roof height."[Lynn, Abraham C., and Robert Reitherman *AEI 2011 : building integration solutions : proceedings of the 2011 Architectural Engineering National Conference, March 30-April 2, 2011 Oakland, California*.

03. "The ground floor is a reinforced concrete slab on grade. The interior face of the exterior walls and the party wall are exposed brick. The freestanding interior columns are 6”-diameter steel lally columns. The first floor ceiling is plaster, on wood lath attached to the underside of the second-floor joists, and is at 14‘-0” AFF. A new HVAC system is planned for rooftop installation, with supply and return ducts to be fed down adjacent to the east party wall; new interior construction on the first floor may expose new ductwork or construct a new suspended ceiling to conceal the new ductwork."[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed. Wiley, 2016.]

04. "Intermediate Floors and Roof The construction of the first floor is very similar to that used in more traditional houses. The joists are usually at 400 or 600mm centres and are secured in position by nailing to the head binder. A header joist is nailed round the perimeter of the floor and, besides providing a firm base for the upper floor panels, this prevents fire from entering the floor cavities."[MBEng, Duncan Marshall BSc MCIOB, and Derek Worthing BSc Mphil MRICS *The Construction of Houses, Fourth Edition*. 4th ed.

06. "The result is a six-level house with high-ceilinged living and entertaining spaces opening out to a rear garden, as seen in the revised floor plans and sections of Illustration 9–38. New floor levels have been designated, starting with the original basement (level B) for the family room, the original first floor (level 1F) for the entry and library, the newly created floor levels 1R (living room) and 2F (master bedroom), the original third floor (level 2R) for a guest room, and the original fourth floor (level 3) for guest/ maid rooms and a studio with abundant daylight."[Karlen, Mark, and Rob Fleming *Space Planning Basics*. 4th ed.

14. "Elevators First Floor Fig. 2. 17. Stairs and floor openings. above often are referred to as a step. The steps of a stairway can be made self supporting but generally are supported on structural members. Stairs are usually provided with railings along the sides, for safety reasons. Where two floors are connected by stairs, an opening at least as wide as the stairs must be provided in the upper floor over the stairs to permit passage to that level."[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.

15. "Thus, if a floor-ceiling assembly is in IIC 61, its INR is 61 - 51 = 10. Typically, an assembly consisting of oak flooring, !-in. plywood sub floor , 2 X 10 wood joists and !-in. gypsumboard ceiling is in IIC 23. If the floor is carpeted, IIC rises to 48. Similarly, an 8-in. concrete floor slab is in IIC 35, but when it is carpeted, IIC increases to 57. These results indicate that a thick carpet over a good pad is an effective isolator of impact sounds."[Merritt, Frederick S., and James Ambrose (auth.) *Building Engineering and Systems Design*.
