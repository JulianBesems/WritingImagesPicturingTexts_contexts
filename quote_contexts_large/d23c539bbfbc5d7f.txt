Selected: The problem-solving approach to architecture is exemplified by a 'third generation' design method based on Popperian falsification: if one is interested in a problem then attempt to solve it by making a tentative assertion and devise a test to appraise that assertion critically. A number of different models form the basis for data generation, hypothesis testing and theory generation, but within an architectural context, design practice may be seen as a matter of generating design proposals and then testing them and modifying and improving them where necessary.[(auth.), H. H. Rosenbrock, and Dr Paul Arthur (eds.) *CADCAM in Education and Training: Proceedings of the CAD ED 83 Conference*. Springer US, 1984.]

01. "This is because “no one theatre artist works independently to create  a performance” (Malloy 2014, p. 1). Secondly, theatre and operatic design is a type  of multimodal, micro-design problem rare in architecture, but it also directly engages  with similar spatial and representational concerns. Finally, theatre and operatic design  occurs within the confines or limits of a building and negotiating the connections  between the physical architecture and the temporal staging of a production is one  crucial goal of the design team."[INPUT: Lee et al. - 2024 - Multimodality in Architecture Collaboration, Technology and Education.pdf]

02. "It is not economical to create the highest standard and level of provision in every area. Design judgement is needed to ensure the appropriate level of facilities for each type of space. There needs to be an ‘intelligible order for the building, and positive differences of visual environment within a simple structural shell’ (Long, 1995, p. 71)."[Architecture), Brian Edwards PhD (Glasgow University School of *Libraries and Learning Resource Centres, Second Edition*. 2nd ed.

03. "This is not a case. Architects and buildings did appear in much of the work I did in preparation for  this book, but their presence has been omitted from  the final composition. They acted almost as a sort  of cast, a scaffold to be removed after completion. I  wanted to foreground not the exemplar character  of specific architectures but rather the theoretical  milieu in which they could have been accommodated. In a way if the image I tried to speak of is the  paradox of an image without image, the architecture  I tried to foreground is an architecture without architecture."[INPUT: Villa - 2024 - Upon entropy architectonics of the image in the a.pdf]

04. "BIM can provide the basis for a wide range of simulations—  from maintenance scheduling to pedestrian movement—and Digital Twins (often an  enhanced BIM using sensor data and the “Internet of Things”) provide the capacity  to refine design operations using big data (Lee et al. 2021). Most significantly, design  is a team process using synchronous and asynchronous modes of communication,  whether copresent (in the same physical space) or not."[INPUT: Lee et al. - 2024 - Multimodality in Architecture Collaboration, Technology and Education.pdf]

05. "Gu et al. ’s research examines the role of digital technologies in supporting design  collaboration. The study not only compares collaborative processes across three  design environments (Fig. 1. 2) but also explores the impact of two different team  dynamics. Similar to the findings in Lee’s and Ostwald’s research, it reveals that  hierarchy-like teams (architects and planners) tend to generate a greater number of  ‘shared goals’ activities compared to more diverse teams (architects and end-users).  Interestingly, participants in the VR environment using Hyve-3D, which is limited  to ‘time-bound local’ and ‘collaborative decision’ in Fig. 1. 2b, produce a relatively  higher number of ‘shared goals’ activities. Nonetheless, due to the increased level  of multimodality, the videoconferencing is associated with the highest percentage of  ‘shared space’ among the three environments in their research.

06. "Users will ﬁnd conﬂicting messages which deny them any understanding of how the building is to work. Harmony is the result of dialogue between those who commission, design and ultimately use the library. First stages in planning Assessments of current and projected user needs provide vital information to the architect. Until such information is received, the design cannot begin. Needs should be analysed by library staff in terms of current service delivery and provision of facility."[Architecture), Brian Edwards PhD (Glasgow University School of *Libraries and Learning Resource Centres, Second Edition*. 2nd ed. Architectural Press, 2009.]

08. "A scaling factor of minus one forms a mirror image of a segment. This is useful if a building or part of a building shows symmetry; a module of one half can be constructed then joined with its mirror image to form the complete shape. The assembly of a limited set of standard solids obviously cannot define all possible scenes and for this reason it must be possible to create arbitrary solids for specific tasks."[(Auth.), R. A. Reynolds *Computing for Architects*. Elsevier Ltd, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1987.]

09. "By holistic, I mean that it sees interaction within a larger frame, often a cultural frame, and recognizes that an interactive artifact must be designed as a part of this larger system. By expressive, I mean that it recognizes the ways in which design and design motifs express systems of values. Design communicates . So a key component of interaction design involves considering the message that the design should communicate and how this relates both to the task at hand and to the details of the design."[Dourish, Paul *Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction (Bradford Books)*. The MIT Press, 2001.]

10. "Another important design principle from architecture is the idea of gaining gradual knowledge of the space through use. Designers should aim for a ‘responsive environment’, ensuring the availability of alternative routes, the legibility of landmarks, paths and districts and the ability to undertake a range of activities. One application of urban design principles to websites is described in Benyon and Wilmes (2003)."[Benyon, David, Phil Turner, and Susan Turner *Designing Interactive Systems: People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies*. Addison Wesley, 2005.]

11. "To make this possible, the data is arranged so that it can evolve naturally with the design just as an architect works from a broad concept to a detailed scheme. 180 Environmental analysis GOAL and ESP are applicable at different design stages. GOAL requires minimal data and is intended to give quick but approximate results at the sketch-design stage."[(Auth.), R. A. Reynolds *Computing for Architects*. Elsevier Ltd, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1987.]

12. "Technological opportunities continue to evolve, and the sets of options available to designers is continually evolving. Principles should be more stable than design practice. A second reason is one that has also been a matter of research investigation herethe importance of context. I have deliberately discussed design implications at a level that will require designers and others interested in exploring embodied interaction to pick and choose how they apply the principles to the different settings, technologies, and needs that characterize each design encounter."[Dourish, Paul *Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction (Bradford Books)*.

14. "A guideline for office design, however, needs to keep in mind the distinction between the two different groups of office experiences: Design-specific experiences; and general experiences. The two types of experience differ in their approach to office design and to specific problems. In addition, the two groups of experience provide different conditions for research feedback to the design process. Design-specific experiences are dependent on a unique condition in each specific office, determined by its architectural and functional features."[Schifferstein, Hendrik N.J., and Paul Hekkert (Eds.) *Product Experience*. 2013.]

15. "Plus les rapports des deux réalités seront lointains et justes, plus l’image sera forte” (“The image . . . results not from a comparison but from a juxtaposition of two realities that are more or less distant. The more the relations between the two juxtaposed realities are distant and valid, the stronger the image will be”) (MS, p. 324). Although Breton’s concept of the image owed as much to Apollinaire as to Reverdy, as I argued in the last chapter, we may take this statement as our guide. Whether one speaks of two intersecting planes, two contradictory terms, or two conflicting images the dynamics are the same: intensity is a function of distance or, more precisely, of dissimilarity."[Bohn, Willard *The Rise of Surrealism: Cubism, Dada, and the Pursuit of the Marvelous*.
