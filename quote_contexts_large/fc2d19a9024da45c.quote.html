    <pre>The Writing Images and Picturing Text editor (WIPTe) forms the primary subject of this thesis, as well as its operation and context. The primary focus in constructing this multi-modal instrument together is to facilitate a constant setting within which this thesis is to be written. Therefore turning on itself both as an outline of what it is proposing as a research direction, all the time whilst demonstrating the outcome of its own question, simultaneaously. Therefore it was deemed of importance that WIPT was finished before the final writing stage. This chapter will go through all of the steps of its implementation, whilst continuing to be accompanied by the imagery and textual contexts it puts forward.</pre>

    <div class="selected">As a work of effective autobiography it is never finished as the final full stop, death, remains unwritten. Yet if we’re to instead read Debord’s work as a poetics then the meaning is perhaps more elusive still. The end of the book is in a sense unwritable, this work, like all of Debord’s body, becoming a prolegomena for a work never to be finished. The finished work is not realised as a ‘work’, a body of literature that realises a definite conclusion.[Justin Clemens, Nicholas Heron, and Alex Murray *The Work of Giorgio Agamben: Law, Literature, Life*. 2009.]</div>

<li>&quot;I hoped to Collaboration, Concepts, and Assemblages create a venue or venues that would facilitate the functioning of inquiry in compelling, distinctive, and significant ways. A copse of concepts guided these initial efforts, concepts drawn from the corpus of work of Dewey, Weber, and Foucault, as well as, in this instance, Deleuze. The challenge has been to make these con&quot;&quot; cepts function in an assemblage different from the ones in which and for which they were created.&quot;[Rabinow, Paul *The Accompaniment: Assembling the Contemporary*.

Introduction  Just as photographs — images made  according to their own conventions —  are not ‘tracings of reality’, neither is  language. Le Corbusier, Pavilion Suisse,  Paris, 1930 © FLC L3(10)3-21  (U7  Modern architecture, as well as being a  new style of building, also created a new  and distinctive way of talking about  architecture. (From Pont, The British at  &quot;[INPUT: Forty - Words and Buildings A Vocabulary of Modern Architecture.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Whereas Milizia had claimed that ‘words in discourse separately have little or  no effect’, both theories of the fragment claimed that individual elements of  architecture carried potentially as much effect as the work as a whole. The force  of this particular argument about the unlikeness of architecture and literature  would appear to have contributed to a loss of interest in analogies between  architecture and classical literary theory.  (ii) to characterize ‘style’ in architecture. J. -F. Blondel’s Cours d’Architecture,  the largest and most important work of architectural criticism of the eighteenth  century, is in part an extended application of the ut pictura poesis analogy to  architecture. Blondel’s book is full of comments about the relationship of  architecture to the classical theory of poetry, principally in order to demonstrate  the range of expressive genres and characters available in architecture, but also to  &quot;[INPUT: Forty - Words and Buildings A Vocabulary of Modern Architecture.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;For this to occur, the relation between form and what is determined by form needs to be re-conceived. The first important step towards achieving this is found in mathematics, its epistemology and work done on the historical character of mathematical formalism. Serres himself devotes a significant portion of Hermès I to this question, but Webb illustrates it here by referring to Jean Cavaillès, whose work seems to precisely lead in the direction that Serres was looking.&quot;[Herzogenrath, Bernd *Time and History in Deleuze and Serres*. Bloomsbury Academic, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;The work we are speaking of, then, sides with an irreducibly endless series of interfaces. Lacking a determining negation by the other, these figures of thought cannot reflect themselves into mere identity; rather, the work in question remains suspended betwixt and between, to the side of, by right, only a virtual middle between nonidentical interfaces. It follows that the question of the (literal and figural) unity of such work must take a different turn. Although Andrzej Warminski&#x27;s Readings in Interpretation invites its reader to think about such a turn, this work must also be regarded as a book on Holderlin, Hegel, and Heidegger.&quot;[Gasche, Rodolphe *Of Minimal Things: Studies on the Notion of Relation*. Stanford University Press, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;Guattari contrasts his own account of the machinic phylum against the schema of the four causes in Heidegger’s technology essay, which he found overly pessimistic as well as too narrow in its definition of the machine. While it overlaps with What Is Philosophy?thematically and theoretically, Guattari’s final book departs from the joint work by its emphasis on the growing importance of subjectivity in contemporary world politics.&quot;[Young, Eugene B., Gary Genosko, and Janell Watson *The Deleuze and Guattari Dictionary*.

The German Vorstellung can be translated either as “presentation” or as “representation”; in both cases, as Heidegger points out, it means the mental having-of-an-object.&quot;[Heidegger, Martin, and Thomas Sheehan *Logic : the question of truth*. English ed. Bloomington, Ind: Indiana University Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Here as elsewhere in this book, I introduce a concept-assemblage-and then describe how it could be taken from the work it had been designed to perform originally and remediated so as to address a different set of problems in another time and place. Concepts, as opposed to theory, need to be constantly adjusted, remediated, and ramified. The modest pedagogy of the concept, in my understanding, lies in that work. THEORY In two books dedicated to systematizing Deleuze&#x27;s work, the theorist Manuel DeLanda provides a systematic reconstruction of his core conceptual repertoire while readily admitting that Deleuze never presented his works in this fashion.&quot;[Rabinow, Paul *The Accompaniment: Assembling the Contemporary*.
