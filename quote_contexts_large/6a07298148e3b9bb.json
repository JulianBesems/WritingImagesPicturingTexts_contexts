It is often drawn to scale, with the use of lines, symbols, and colors to convey the various components of the space. The floor plan can be used to organize and communicate the spatial relationships between different elements of the building, such as walls, doors, windows, and furniture. In this sense, it serves as a visual tool for architects, designers, and builders to plan and execute the construction of a building.", "suggest_context": "4.1.1 FLOOR . . . staking the claim of civilization on the raw ground, encoding usage and assuming decoration, the floor then accrues complexity in its section while simplifying its surface details. The textural details of previous occupants are kept intact. There is a map-like pattern on the concrete floor. It is a space of pure white. Most of the buildings in the world are structured today by three-dimensional frames, consisting of floor slabs supported by beams, beams supported by columns, columns supported by foundations, and foundations sitting on the earth. The beams and columns, usually set at the corners of a rectangular grid, are made out of steel or reinforced concrete; the floor slabs, most of the time, of reinforced concrete. Despite this, the language of space planning is the floor plan, and its graphic qualities cannot be entirely ignored."}
