The font, named \"Estrangelo\", is an Assyrian font that is over 2,000 years old, and its use in this project serves to underscore the idea that the presented images are not just random, but are part of a larger narrative that spans centuries. Through the use of this font, the viewer is able to connect with the images on a deeper level, and to see them as part of a larger story that is being told. The use of the font also adds to the sense of a connection between the past and the present, as it serves to bridge the gap between ancient and modern times. The Estrangelo font is not just used for the images, but also for the text, which helps to create a sense of continuity between the two. The font is used for both the image captions and the text that accompanies the images, which helps to create a sense of cohesion between the different elements of the project. The use of the Estrangelo font also adds to the sense of a connection between the different elements of the project, as", "suggest_context": "The nudge tightens concepts across modalities where words and labels truly coincide in a scene, thus adding a more fine-grain tuning; unrelated pairs asss,l0 remain unchanged. Updates occur along film axes, so the cinematographic embedding space basis is preserved. scene Given a frame selected by a figurative query a set of labels, we infer a scene window by sliding over adjacent frames and keeping the maximal contiguous interval whose perframe label maintains a certain percentage overlap with the input search set. I chose a threshold of  30 after manual testing, which in practice yields scenes of between 20-60 seconds. The result is a dynamic element s that supports inspection of a scenography around a figurative projection while remaining consistent with its indices. Throughout the setup in navigating between the film domains, I intended to keep the system playful. Zupanis reading of comedy via HegelLacan treats universality not as a predicative truth to be narrated or staged, but as something that incarnates; becomes the subject through the odd one in, the short-circuit between heterogeneous orders. Rather than seek a fusion of modalities a tragic identity, the editor privileges proportions that let the substance of the corpora become subject through casts that recompose indices. subject narrates the universal, the essential, the absolute; in tragedy, the subject enacts or stages the universal, the essential, the absolute; in comedy, the subject is or becomes the universal, the essential, the absolute. Which is also to say that the universal, the essential, the absolute become the subject. - The Odd One In: On Comedy - Zupani Paraphrasing Zupani: comedy is where universality appears in the singular, through operations that connect incommensurables without abolishing their difference. In this sense, the instruments projections aspire less to closure than to concrete universality appearing in the work: a bias toward operative harmony Platos proportional limit over finality, and toward architectonic becoming over representational truth. The presented images are included as context, in a way meant to be a juxtaposition to the spoken yet atmospheric to it, could come to fulfil a comical nature. The overall endeavour of the text editor is therefore one that sometimes strives to go towards the comical, certainly more than that of truth and absoluteness. PDF The method for the pdfs is largely identical to that of the films. The only difference being that the text comes from the body of text within the pdf instead of subtitles, and the images are extracted images from the pdf instead of frames. This does mean that the text corpus of the pdfs is inherently much more abundant than that within the film, and the image corpus is relatively far sparser. Also because the pdfs do not have the condition of strict co-occurrence of text and image like in the films, we do not apply the nudge step to the pdfs."}
