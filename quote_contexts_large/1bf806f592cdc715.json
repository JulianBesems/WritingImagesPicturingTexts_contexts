It does not allow for the integration of the theoretical, cultural, literary, atmospheric, philosophical and associative dimensions of architectural design or for the flexibility of the design as an idea when mediated by the designer. The consequence of this is not just representational; it is epistemic. Architecture risks forgetting how its media think."}
