01. "*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&annotation=WA8NIH6S)"

02. "*The two options, one emphasizing the corporeal properties of things made, the other concentrating on the disembodied properties in the drawing, are diametrically opposed: in the one corner, involvement, substantiality, tangibility, presence, immediacy, direct action; in the other, disengagement, obliqueness, abstraction, mediation and action at a distance.* — **Interesting as an argument for the approach that has been taken to the role of the computational in representing architecture. This has been primarily been through that of the first "popular' option. Thus the challenges of the second have been neglected in this form/technics of communication.** [Evans - 1986 - Translations from drawing to building.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LM88SVV5?page=6&annotation=Q6KQN5ZC)"

03. "*Lemke noted (2002: 303) ‘No [written] text is an image. No text or visual representation means in all and only the same ways that text can mean. It is this essential incommensurability that enables genuine new meanings to be made from the combinations of modalities’.* — **-this is exactly the right way of putting it compared to earlier sentence** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=272&annotation=KAHF5HK6)"

04. "*with moving within indexes and thereby exposing asked-for content indirectly and evocatively, and not by representation* [[Applied Virtually Book Series] Ludger Hovestadt & Vera Buhlmann - EigenArchitecture (2013, Ambra Verlag) - libgen.li (1) (Conflict) (1).pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UDVBETNW?page=66&annotation=SQ62E8IM)"

05. "*he text must say nothing to this gazing subject who is a viewer, not a reader. As soon as he begins to read, in fact, shape dissipates.* — **Again CLIP:, here this also characterises how the image does not express more than the text and the existing context from which the imagery is inferred.** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=36&annotation=WKUPEMTK)"

06. "*From paint­ ing to image, from image to text, from text to voice, a sort of imaginary pointer indicates, shows, fixes, locates, impose s a syste m of references, tries to sta­ bilize a unique space* — **How might we go about this in a digital context where description and image collapse?** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=42&annotation=Z28V8UDG)"

07. "*ey are words drawing words; at the surface of the image, they form t. he reflecti on of a sentence saying that this is not a pipe. The image of a text* [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=35&annotation=QBHNXDGX)"

08. "*Thus the interaction between modes is significant for meaning making.* [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=268&annotation=3TX4L987)"

09. "*By arranging different contexts and atmospheres, the player dances with a book, with the library it is a part of, and its concepts. As an offering, a book captivated by each new context offers more than its author conceived. A book has a life of its own; it is a complex character* — **Interesting take for how the fragmentation of things can offer new perspectives** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=330&annotation=LJX36V79)"

10. "*Bearing in mind the thoughts presented in an earlier part of this text regarding referentiality and recycling, it is important to note that the algorithms used in the project, e. g. , thePrincipalComponentAnalysis algorithm and MarchingCubesAlgorithm, are already and widely in practice. They are thoroughly adapted, functionally redirected, recycled, to fit the needs of design in this particular project.
