<li>&quot;These innovations resulted in better-performing building skin glass assemblies, sometimes with qualities that defy the very nature of glass. Theories of Glass Transparent, translucent or opaque, glass is a liquid “frozen” in a solid state, “cooled to a rigid condition without crystallizing” (according to ASTM).&quot;[Yglesias, Caren *The Innovative Use of Materials in Architecture and Landscape Architecture: History, Theory and Performance*.

<li>&quot;Glass was very expensive at the time, and its use here was sensational, giving rise to the saying: ‘Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall. ’ If the silhouette retains an idea of a turreted castle, the fabric of the building was made newly delicate; even the walls of Chambord (pages 66–67) look more solid than those of Hardwick.&quot;[Ballantyne, Andrew *Key buildings from prehistory to the present : plans, sections and elevations*.
