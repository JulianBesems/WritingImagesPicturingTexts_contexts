If the limits of an architect\u2019s digital language are shifting toward the geometric, centred around the 3D model, then we must ask what modes of architectural thinking are being excluded. This is not merely a philosophical issue; it is a practical and epistemic concern. What are the consequences when the qualitative, the speculative, and the non-geometric dimensions of architecture lose their footing in computational discourse?"}
