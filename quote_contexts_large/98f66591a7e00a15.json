Le Corbusier, writing on the Modulor, warned against the seduction of numerical scales: *\u201cIndeed it is a dangerous tool, for, starting out from its abstract obedience to numbers, one is tempted, by negligence or laziness, to perpetuate it in other convenient measures [...] much to the detriment of architecture\u201d.* Setting out with the ambition to find a harmonic alternative: *\u201ca scale of visual measures has its place because the first effect of this new tool would be to unite, co-ordinate, bring into harmony the work which is at present divided and disjointed\u201d.* These insights frame a historical precedent for the tension explored in this thesis: how instruments for measure can as easily narrow thought as they can open it. The aim here is to construct a multimodal architectonic instrument that can sustain the qualitative, the contingent, and the situated within the digital abundance of contemporary practice.", "suggested_query": "The Modulor's modular arithmetic, in its turn, was a reaction to the spatial logic of the grid, which had been the dominant organisational principle in modern architecture. By introducing a new, human-centred measure of proportions, Le Corbusier aimed to re-establish a sense of harmony in the built environment. In this sense, his work can be seen as an early attempt to vectorise the spatial, to translate the complexity of human experience into a manageable, computable system. As we move into the digital age, the challenge is not to dismiss the Modulor's vision, but to update its methods and scales to accommodate the vastly expanded possibilities of computation. This requires a re-examination of the very notion of proportion, as well as the ways in which we draw, model, and represent the built environment.", "suggest_context": "1.2.2 PROPOSAL Given the scope, and the intent of engaging with methodology over architectural material, the point being made is epistemic: architecture is mediated by many modes that do not collapse into a single model. Architectural thought does not, and never did, reside in one privileged representation, but in the proportional negotiations between several - drawings, images, texts, models - each standing apart, yet held together in practice. In the digital, this plurality meets a specific condition: vectorisation. To vectorise is to encode artefacts so that relations can be expressed as distances and neighbourhoods in a high-dimensional space. In this sense, contemporary computation introduces a geometry beyond the three-dimensional: not the geometry of solids, but of proximities, sometimes governed by explicit procedures, often emerging as probabilistic reductions. This condition is productive, but to the complexity of intuitive navigation within something we can't visualise - n-dimensions - it also comes with a risk: that translation becomes the default operation caption  image, prompt  output, and difference is flattened into alignment. The proposal of this thesis is to treat such projections as architectonic devices that stage relations between heterogeneous domains so they can be read, re-read, and re-proportioned.
