    <pre>Specifically, the work proposes an architectonic reading of the multimodal gap: the inherent misalignment between image and text that remains ingrained in machine learning embeddings. Rather than treating this gap as a technical flaw to be overcome, it is reframed as a conceptual opportunity. Drawing from Simondon’s notion of transduction, Foucault’s analysis of Magritte’s pipe, and the epistemic logic of architectural modalities, the multimodal gap is approached as a productive obstacle for speculation.</pre>

<li>&quot;Because Harries’ notion of natural symbols offers a hermeneutical means to locate broad lived qualities of architectural meaning expressed dialectically, one is provided one heuristic structure for locating the experience of buildings-in-themselves—the unique shadings of architectural presence and ambience evoked by particular combinations of specific natural symbols. Harries’ language provides one interpretive possibility for bypassing experiential accounts as they are grounded in the pre-reflective, unthematized attention of user lifeworlds and natural attitudes that Jones emphasizes in his accounts of ritual-architectural events. Harries offers an interpretation of architecture whereby the text—architecture-as-experienced-and-understood-viaexpression-of-particular-natural-symbols—can more precisely and completely reveal itself. In relation to Wachterhauser’s four guidelines for trustworthy interpretation, one can make the following claims for Harries’ language of natural symbols: 1.&quot;[(eds.), Bruce B.

<li>&quot;Fundamental to this distanciation is architecture’s internalization of technique through recollection of the tectonic. What this entails is that a discussion of ‘image’, as one consequence of the introduction of mediatic technologies into architectural discipline, although it has proliferated diverse and innovative approaches to design, nevertheless dismisses the culture of building, thus putting limitations on the scope of criticism. To speak of the tectonic relationship between column and wall, for example, does not mean to dismiss the perceptual realm offered by the mediatic technologies.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*.

<li>&quot;Each 36 The Architectural Representation of Reality of those traditions is, in fact, a reinterpretation of one or more pre-existing ones, although patrons and architects often prefer to represent them as new. The connection between this second stratum and an underlying long-cycle tradition is, as one would expect from any representation, not logical but transversal. Before proposing five representational clusters into which to roughly group these shorter-cycle traditions so they become accessible to research, it seems useful to adjust the conventional paradigm of the analysis of worldwide building.&quot;[Aart J.J. Mekking, Eric Roose *The Global Built Environment as a Representation of Realities: Why and How Architecture Should Be the Subject of Worldwide Comparison*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;Conversely, architecture as a discipline focuses on the permanence of the architectural object and the myth of its perfectability. DeLanda’s synthetic understanding of cities is inherently destabilizing to architecture because it elevates material factors to the same level as cultural production. The current fascination with fluidity may serve as a catalyst toward a new understanding of architectural processes. However, the preoccupation with representations of fluidity as built form restricts us to rigidly conventional architectural discourse.&quot;[Vincent James, Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;A contemporary building is increasingly heterogeneous and likely to include materials and systems from three or more continents. When architectural innovation is confined to the image of a building, new technologies or materials are limited to their decorative effects. If our ideas about architecture remain fluid, then buildings can continually be reconceived relative to changing problems or conditions. While new technologies are starting to erode the limitations of standardization and enable more fluid and adaptive responses to material fabrication, our social and cultural habits of design create a barrier to greater innovation.&quot;[Vincent James, Jennifer Yoos *VJAA: Vincent James Associates Architects*. Princeton Architectural Press, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Ultimately, the architectural languages of Jones, Harries, and Thiis-Evensen are all provocative hermeneutical explications. They demonstrate the prolific interpretive possibilities that a text—in this case, architecture—offers. They demonstrate that, as with any hermeneutical project, the understanding of any text is multivalent, always underway, and never complete. The work of these three architectural thinkers is inspiring and motivates researchers to forge other innovative hermeneutic renditions of architectural expression, experience, and meaning.

<li>&quot;The pleasure of architecture is granted when architecture fulfils one’s spatial expectations, as well  as embodying architectural ideas or concepts, with  intelligence and invention There is also a special  pleasure to be mentioned: the pleasure that results  from conflicts, when the sensual pleasure of space  conflicts with the pleasure of order. The architecture of pleasure lies where conceptual  and spatial paradoxes merge in the middle of  delight, where architectural language breaks into a  thousand pieces, where the elements of architecture are dismantled and its rules transgressed.  Typologies,  morphologies,  spatial  compressions,  logical constructions - all dissolve. Representa-  i7  tion then equals abstraction, as they collide in a ™  staged and necessary conflict: repetition, discontinuity, cliches and neologisms. &quot;[INPUT: Tschumi__The_Manhattan_Transcripts.pdf]</li>
