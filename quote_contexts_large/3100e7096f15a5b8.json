The films are then analyzed using a range of metrics, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis. These metrics are used to identify patterns and correlations between the films, and to establish a baseline understanding of the data. This baseline understanding is then used to inform the construction of the multi-modal model, which is designed to capture the complexities and nuances of the data.  This model is then used to generate the thesis, which is a narrative that is woven together from the patterns and correlations identified in the data.  The thesis is intended to be a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of the themes and ideas that emerge from the data.  In the following chapter, I will describe how this model can be used to establish other biases and explore new modes of analysis.", "suggest_context": "3.1 OUTLINE - The text editor operates in a multi-modal manner, constantly both personal and general. - There are different layers of private and public: the private construct of choices and curation facilitates the projection on the common sense - The Scales of the data differs. Therefore the role of the model is here interpreted as the curation and construction of the correlation between the modalities that are facilitated by a chosen set of multi-modal documents. The primary dataset for this is a selection of 215 films which are used as the primary model used to write this thesis. This chapter will describe how this model is constructed and how other modes can be used to establish other biases, which will be demonstrated in the writing of chapter 4."}
