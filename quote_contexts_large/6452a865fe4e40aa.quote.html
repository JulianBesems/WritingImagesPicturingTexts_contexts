    <pre>The PhD thesis presented here revolves around the process of writing itself. Not in the way you might expect where the writing follows it’s argument, and it traces a path throughout the 3 years spent on this research, but rather in a way where after three years the culmination of research is the process of writing this itself. To clarify, we are particularly interested in the writing as a process, in the same way that from an architectural research perspective one might be interested primarily in the process of the designing, not necessarily the outcome itself. But we digress here. The reason from mentioning this in the outset, is that the instrument in which this thesis was written is designed and developed itself, as a response to the journey of engaging with the phd research. So everything that is presented here is at once the presentation of the research within this text and images, as well as a result that provides the material of the research itself because it was written in the instrument it describes. Therefore as the writing was a back and forth process between the author and the instrument, the reader will be asked to engage in this relation as well where the text is both explanation and outcome. It proposes a similar engagement to an architect walking through a building in order to understand it rather than being presented with the plans straight away.</pre>

<li>&quot;The revolution began with the destruction of the Bastille, that monument of (military) architecture and symbol of the ancien régime, whose end it marked at the same time that it heralded, as Jules Michelet would write, the triumph of “what is outside time, outside the future and outside the past, immutable Right. ” This takes us back to theEncyclopédie and the analogy Blondel’s text suggests between the rules obeyed by architecture and the principles of natural Right. Architecture or revolution—the modernist watchword, posed in the form of an alternative or a dilemma—was to translate as clearly as possible the ambiguity of the relations that the art of building, if not architecture itself, has never ceased to maintain with the prospect of a generalized catastrophe: either architecture looks to stave off such a catastrophe by rendering it useless, or it merely aspires to furnish humanity with the means to survive such a catastrophe without too much damage.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;Is not to clad still to mask, to dissimulate, to mislead, if not—though with the proper “inconspicuousness”—to ornament?In fact, Loos’s architecture is, in its own way, an example of the “drama” of modern architecture that Manfredo Tafuri has characterized best: an architecture reduced to wishing itself pure, a strictly formal exercise, deprived of utopia, useless, but nevertheless preferable to projects that are clad in ideological rags but in fact serve the reigning order. 17 Tomb It is here that we find the confirmation, by a new paradox, of Loos’s project for the Chicago Tribune of 1922.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>
<li>&quot;Schelling’s definition of architecture as the “metaphor of construction” does not necessarily imply that the proper meaning of architecture, let alone its truth, is to be found in construction; note that Gothic architecture and its linear model of a constructive system possess in their details none of the rigor of the working drawing. However, a whole aspect of architecture also derives from the category of themask—and indeed the exterior envelope of Dubuffet’sTower acts as a mask, one whose figures deny in dissimulation the constructive apparatus of modernity.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>

<li>&quot;How could it be risked, when modern architecture’s own relationship to catastrophe too often takes the form that Le Corbusier meant when, upon discovering New York, he wrote “a catastrophe, but a beautiful and worthy catastrophe”37—though now without an aesthetic effect to redeem the social or ecological mess?The form of tabula rasa, if not a hole, to which the place known as Ground Zero now corresponds in Lower Manhattan does not invalidate the thesis underlying the organization of articles devoted to architecture in theEncyclopédie.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>

<li>&quot;Chapter 14, “Blotting Out Architecture?A Fable in Seven Parts,” translated by Julie Rose for publication inLog 1 (Fall 2003), was first given as the lecture “Effacer l’architecture” at the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal in May 2003. Introduction I keep thinking of myself as some sort of displaced philosopher. The issue of displacement is, in any sense, crucial to my work. According to Gilles Deleuze, philosophy has mostly to do with inventing concepts. In that sense, I am not a philosopher: I do not invent concepts, but I try to displace them.&quot;[Noah’s Ark: Essays on Architecture, Hubert Damisch; Anthony Vidler (ed.), 2016]</li>
