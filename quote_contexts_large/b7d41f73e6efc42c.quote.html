    <pre>Applying this to ~1.1M books and retaining words appearing in ≥30 books yields a vocabulary of 63,029 unique terms ( 1_1m_vocab ). We compute a sparse TF‑IDF matrix with 1,100,990 rows 63,029 columns (| books | × | words |) and reduce it to 300 dimensions via LSA : $|B| * 300$. Because of the size, this was done with truncated SVD in randomised batches. Cosine similarity provides the rotational metric for operations over $B$.</pre>

      <li>&quot;*An Informational Instrument celebrates these contradictions without having an explicit a priori base unit. It opens a different perspective. What if the emphasis is not on measuring reality but on encoding and decoding it in many ways, by crafting different keys to access the world in many ways? What if it is about articulating faces and mixing libraries? It is a different game then. You are not looking for specific properties to measure, but are trying to develop a communication channel through which you can articulate profiles of different encodings. This is the search for the most general and abstract ingredients in a given situation. There is no base unit of a book.

<li>&quot;*Again, this small play was taken place with-out imposing any predefined and external categories on books.* — **Question of categorisation of things through context is useful.

<li>&quot;*The application of bridges to an object yields a partition spectrum, which serves as the basis for defining objects. The spectrum can be further refined until the satisfactory approximation of an object is reached. Only at this point can that which is actually distinguished be represented as a set.

<li>&quot;*The operative concepts of the mathematical lexicon trigger models that must count as “reduced,” but not because they would draw a poor representation of the phenomena they “model. ” Models don’t “represent” at all, rather they “realize. ” Mathematics is the inexhaustible source of a generosity from which such “reduced models” (that are capable of realizing particular phenomena) can draw.* [Buehlmann__Mathematics_and_Information_in_the_Philosophy_of_Michel_Serres.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QWPAXNP5?page=25&amp;annotation=4K8VHMC4)&quot;</li>
