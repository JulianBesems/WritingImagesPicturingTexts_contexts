    <pre>The reverse shows a further contrast compared to the textual internal projection of the topic of conversation. Where conversations about playgrounds onto the figurative and the playground as a figurative index projected on its own had a certain correspondence, at least in its primary region, the textual internal projection and the figurative playground onto text do not have any significant alignment based on the two textual screens (comparing figures 3.5:2 and 3.5:10). From this we can clearly see the two aren&#x27;t equivalent, nor are the projections reversible. But it also suggests that when a conversation revolves around a playground it does occur a significant amount of times that we also see a playground. However the topics that are discussed on the background of a playground do not have as strong a bias towards also mentioning a playground. An easier to measure metric is by showing that playground is in the top 6% of most relevant figurative indices to playground , while playground is in the top 12% of most relevant textual indices to playground .</pre>

Long and Sedley prefer ‘sustaining’ which certainly has the virtue of better rendering this original meaning; but it is less well adapted to later developments, as we shall see.
