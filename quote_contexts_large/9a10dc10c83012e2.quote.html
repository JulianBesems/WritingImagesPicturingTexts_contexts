    <pre>Different projections around the photo of a casting by Rodin

<em>The way the light danced across the curves of the bronze figure, bringing out the subtle nuances of the sculptor&#x27;s masterful hand. It was as if the very essence of the artist&#x27;s vision had been distilled onto the page, waiting to be rediscovered by the viewer. The faint shadows cast by the model&#x27;s features seemed to whisper secrets of the human form, drawing the eye inexorably to the subject.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;Is not the great raw material of modern art, of our daily art—is it not, in this era, light?In ordinary theaters, light is remote, fastened to the stage. At Le Palace, it is the whole theater that is the stage; here light occupies a deep space, within which it comes alive and performs like an actor; an ― 47 ― intelligent laser, with a complicated and refined mind, like an exhibitor of abstract sculptures, produces enigmatic traces, with sudden mutations: circles, rectangles, ellipses, tracks, cables, galaxies, fringes.&quot;[Barthes, Roland, and Richard Howard *Incidents*. University of California Press, 1992.]</li>
<li>&quot;There was a rattle of metal, the scratch of a match, and suddenly there was light: almost indiscernibly faint, but light just the same. For a moment, Corrie forgot everything—her pain, her desperate condition—as she felt her soul rise toward the dim yellow glow. It seemed to be coming from between the chinks of a strange-looking lantern, very old, with sliding sides of rusted metal. The light was placed in a way that left him in shadow—just a dark shape moving, gray against black. He disappeared around a corner, doing something in an alcove, humming and talking to himself.&quot;[Preston, Douglas J., and Lincoln Child *Still Life with Crows*. Warner Books, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;And light trees. O Pilorge!Your face, like a lone nocturnal garden in Worlds where Suns spin about!And on it, that impalpable sadness, like the light trees in the garden. Your face is dark, as if in broad daylight a shadow had passed over your soul. It must have made you feel cool, for your body shuddered with a shudder subtler than the falling about it of a veil of the tulle known as “gossamer−fine tulle&quot;, for your face is veiled with thousands of fine, light, microscopic wrinkles, painted, rather than engraved, in criss−cross lines.&quot;[Genet, Jean *Our Lady of the Flowers*. Faber and Faber, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;The setting for the above scene had been the smaller room which was illuminated onl y by black light, which turns people into beautiful color and texture. I saw about ten people sitting directl y under the black light, which was back-draped by a white (luminescent lavender, then) sheet, painting on disembodied mannequins with fluorescent paint. . . and on each other, their clothes, etc. I stood under the light and drops of paint fell on m y foot and sandal, and it was exquisite. I returned to this light frequentl y . . . it was peaceful and beautiful beyond description.&quot;[Wolfe, Tom *The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test*. Bantam, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;The star touched down on a nearby hill, causing a whirling shimmer of sand and light. He felt a tug of affinity with it and knew that in a way the star was himself. It’s more than just me. We are all conceived this way. 178 Kirby Crow The light changed to gold and coalesced into the low, powerful shape of an enormous lion crouched on the dune, starlight sliding across sleek, tawny muscles silhouetted against the black of space. A thick, powerful neck arched to the sky as the steady stream of his heated breath fogged the air, white at first, then gradually turning red.&quot;[Crow, Kirby *Angels of the Deep*. 2009.]</li>
<li>&quot;The stars spin clockwise and the words twist and rotate counterclockwise. “I paint against the darkness,” Henry whispers, his voice foreign to his own ears. When he opens his eyes, the rickety wooden stairs have returned to normal. They are steep and narrow but passable. They do not twist or roll. The walls are merely damp. There is no running water anywhere. The light above his head is steady and dim. It isn’t a beautiful light, but rarely has Henry considered any light to be beautiful. Light is, after all, only the absence of darkness.&quot;[Freeman, Brian James *The Painted Darkness*. Cemetery Dance Publications, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Jorsin Alkestes was a light so bright he left shadows standing centuries hence. The semblances of men, burned onto granite walls. And one shadow was perfect above all others. A walking, breathing shadow. A shadow as flickering as the ghosts thrown by a candle, as mutable as a king’s promises. A shadow who devoured light and life. Light is, but a shadow undefined becomes simply darkness. And light had been too long denied the man who had been Acaelus Thorne. He was thin, fraying, a bowlful of smoke.&quot;[Weeks, Brent *Perfect Shadow*. Hachette Digital, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;However, what really matters is what holds them together. Raphael spells out that corresponding parts are joined by parallel lines,  from plan to elevation, or from one elevation to another. These parallels-conservers of true measure-are most readily understood to be  representations of light paths, and understood thus they emphasize remoteness, one way or another, because either the light source projecting  the information or the eye receiving it has to be imagined at an infinite  distance.&quot;[INPUT: Evans - 1995 - The projective cast architecture and its three ge.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Who is so square any more as to use such Gothic trappings?What collection of chain-rattlers feeds that ruminating stove and breathes these pastel gases?He wished for more light but didn’t dare risk tiptoeing across to the lamp. He’d have to be satisfied with the fire pulsing and winking from the round eye of that stove. The light darted softly about the room, touching one object after another . . . a gaily bedecked pair of French royalty dancing a ceramic minuet in a bric-a-brac ballroom; an antler-handled hunting knife skinning buckskin wallpaper from a wall; a full battalion of Reader’s Digest Condensed Books marching in close order across an L-braced plank; hassocks crouching; shades breathing; stools walking long-legged along a web of shadows .&quot;[Kesey, Ken, and Charles Bowden (introduction) *Sometimes a Great Notion*. Penguin Books, 2006.]</li>
<li>&quot;Because of a trick of the light the boy’s—Tom’s—eyes looked open in his severed head. Because of a trick of the light the eyes blinked several times as if trying to adjust to that light. He had a soft, confused stare, like a stuffed toy’s. His mouth moved like a baby’s. Then his naked, headless body sat up on the floor. Then the headless body struggled to its feet, weaving unsteadily. No inner ear for balance, Elaine thought, and almost laughed.&quot;[Skipp, John, and Craig Spector *Book of the Dead*. Mark V Ziesing, 1990.]</li>
<li>&quot;His goal of “describing light” recalls Claude Monet’s desire to paint light in his series paintings, though the intense play of light and shade in Dukla is reminiscent of nothing so much as Caravaggio’s thunderous chiaroscuro. Yet, extraordinary as this goal is, and however remarkable its results, Dukla is also much more than a book about light. In Poland it is widely regarded as Stasiuk’s most brilliant achievement and as one of the landmark texts of the postcommunist period. What is it that makes the book so unusual and memorable?&quot;[Johnston, Bill, and Andrzej Stasiuk *Dukla*. Array: Dalkey Archive Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;“Between the brightness of sunlight and the dim light of the stars is the intermediate light from the moon, giving uneasy mesopic vision, which should not be trusted. ” Throughout time, without words, nature and the artist have best explained the interactions of light, color, and mind. I can look at a canyon shadow or a Byzantine mosaic and understand blue better than I understand a dissertation on the comparatively stubby quantum of electromagnetic radiation measured as 4 × 10-7. meters (blue light).&quot;[Meloy, Ellen *The Anthropology of Turquoise: Reflections on Desert, Sea, Stone, and Sky*. Vintage, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;And in Philadelphia an inner room where light on the wall was left over from informing others, a used, ancestral, rumor. Light like some geometry that’s also some abiding. Light’s body English. Between the trees and the lighted room, a woman sits at an upstairs window. Stressed, 22 unstressed, which is it?The answer is unstressed, stressed. Vision the syntax of everything. She’s either the light’s opus or one of the beats of one of my hearts. Memory forgives itself for the hearts’ atrocities, the axes the hearts flourished as they hacked their way through the thicket, south, then north.&quot;[Smith, Bruce *Devotions*. Chicago, London: University Of Chicago Press, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;One awful day, Samson put his hand under Sylvain&#x27;s hot head to lift him up for water and the warm air around Sylvain&#x27;s face stretched the brown morning light into long, particled waves. The room bent and crumpled, as if under pressure. Samson dropped the glass. Horrified, he watched the rolls of light solidify, right to parallels, and furl down the hall. Samson absently palmed Sylvain&#x27;s novena ring from the end table and passed it from hand to hand. The silver magnified, tripled, grew fat and heavy under the strain of pulled air.&quot;[Vaughan, R.M. *A  Quilted Heart*. Insomniac Press, 2000.]</li>
<li>&quot;So he did need light, after all, if only a little bit. But if he’d managed to do so much in utter darkness—bring her here, tie her up—what kind of work would he need light for?Corrie did not want to follow this train of thought. It was easy to let it go: the instinctual relief of the light made her feel sluggish, torpid. Part of her just wanted to give up, resign herself. She looked around. Dim as it was, the light seemed to reflect back at her in a million crystal-like points, coming from everywhere and nowhere.&quot;[Preston, Douglas J., and Lincoln Child *Still Life with Crows*. Warner Books, 2003.]</li>
<li>&quot;Tonight, however, there was a glaring exception to the darkness rule. From a low doorway with a trefoil arch new-struck through an ancient wall, light spilled into the Plaza. Rising above the horizon of the pavement like some monstrous moon a-shine with the ray of a murderous sun, the new doorway dimmed almost to extinction the stars of the other merchants of mystery. Eerie and unearthly objects for sale spilled out of the doorway a little way with the light, while beside the doorway crouched an avid-faced figure clad in garments never before seen on land or sea… in the World of Nehwon.&quot;[Leiber, Fritz, Jonathan Strahan, and Charles N. Brown *Fritz Leiber: selected stories*. Night Shade Books, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;That was good. Otherwise she would have had only a fifty-fifty chance of swimming in the right direction. In seconds the unutterable blackout of the slot was relieved by a slender line of, not light, but a less complete darkness. There was sufficient sky to house more than one meager star, and the canyon’s rim showed a silver sheen of moonlight. Across the water, the rock face they had descended caught the faint light—enough that Anna could discern it from the water. “Do you feel like we’re being watched?” she asked suddenly.&quot;[Barr, Nevada *The Rope: An Anna Pigeon Novel*. St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;Soon that horizon would be black. Soon night would spread her blackest cloak upon the land. And the canyon still to be crossed. And the tale of the future as yet untold. Then, when Garrison had all but given up hope— A spark in his mind. A glowing point of light emanating from that inmost region where Schroeder&#x27;s ghost held dominion. A light growing brighter by the second, expanding, blossoming into—a vision!A vision so dazzling that the earth seemed to reel under Garrison&#x27;s feet, sending him staggering, stumbling, falling to his knees.&quot;[Lumley, Brian *Psychosphere (Psychomech Trilogy)*. 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;And the man at the table moved a long foot, then a thin hand, and finally lifted his w om om w. A B B Y Y. c head to blink at them with large, dark eyes, whites showing all the way around. Nari whispered: “Pheron… ?” Clean up some. Work on the red light over the—stone?wood?Omit or change: “accidentally,” “alongside,” “the way,” “over a little,” “after a moment. ” Possibly okay. But clean and clarify: how Pheron got in, etc. )Pheron looked like a skeleton. (Wording: The elbows seemed large interruptions along the thinnesses of his arms.&quot;[Delany, Samuel R. *Flight from Neveryon*. Return to Neveryeon, Book 3. Wesleyan University Press, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;Coraghessan Boyle [318] THE SIMILES Light as a paper airplane(and as elegant) —Marge Piercy Lighted windows [at dawn] were scattered like yellow diamonds on black velvet —Loren D. Estleman Lighting streaked the snow.&quot;[Sommer, E. *Similes Dictionary*. Visible Ink Press, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Fragments. Flashes of light. Pieces only. He paints a broken tree rising into a broken city. Parts of windows. Parts of doors. The hard flat world in profile. Lined edges of jawbones. Curved signatures of eyes, staring. 130 When I fly back to the States, a process that takes years and years, I sit in a window seat and sleep on a soft blue pillow the color of early morning light.&quot;[Turner, Brian *My Life as a Foreign Country*. Iraq., United States: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Without the slightest hesitation he strode into the dark cage, bowing slightly to her as he did so, reaching his right hand toward the top of the buttons column, where the light switch was, to turn it on, and said in a low and respectful voice, “Good evening. ” This last came out deeper and more resonant than he’d intended, so that it had a rather sepulchral sound. And his third movement was not completed, for just as he entered, she raised her head and simultaneously reached her black-gloved right hand and that arm across her body and the lower half of her face, apparently anticipating his intention to switch on the light, so that his own hand drew back.&quot;[Leiber, Fritz, Jonathan Strahan, and Charles N. Brown *Fritz Leiber: selected stories*. Night Shade Books, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;We patiently waited for the surge of mosaic colors and fluid motion to take control. It began in the corner of our peripheral visiQn, doing small tricks at first until the movements merged into one and spewed rudely into our dilated pupils. We saw the night sky as Van Gogh painted it a hundred years ago, circular light around the stars, light that circled around other light. Interconnecting stars, implosion and explosion.&quot;[Bear, Ray A. Young *Black Eagle Child: The Facepaint Narratives*. University Of Iowa Press, 1992.]</li>
<li>&quot;The room broke up before her eyes and separated in just that pattern with bars of light vibrating. Suddenl y it became very clear, the way the room was put together, the way the parts fit, the way the parts of everything fit, as if someone had taken an Indian puzzle ring apart for her. It was clear how everything fit together and it wasn&#x27;t reall y a world split up into pointless games and cliques. That was merel y the way it looked before you knew the key.&quot;[Wolfe, Tom *The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test*. Bantam, 1999.]</li>
<li>&quot;And then the gates of perception flipped and he was in free fall. Far, far below was a small sphere spun from a complex tracery of moving light. Beyond that a blue emptiness with no wall or boundary that Alex could see. As Alex&#x27; eyes locked onto the spun gold globe, his mind began to judge distances, launching fresh waves of nausea to sweep through him. Each time his gaze fixed on the distant globe, the whole sky went into a spin, until the globe flicked times and again across his sight like an amphetamine moon speeding endlessly across the face of heaven.&quot;[Grimwood, Jon Courtenay, and Nenad Savic *NeoAddix*. Braguelonne, 2002.]</li>
