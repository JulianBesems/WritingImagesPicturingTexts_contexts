<em>The world was full of beauty, and everyone could see it. It was already clear that this was the perfect place to make everyone happy. As we looked around, we could see the beautiful field and the buildings in the distance. Suddenly, we heard a fire engine racing towards us, and we quickly ran to hold back the fire. Finally, we reached the building and could see the work that had been done to make it safe.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;I glanced around to see who else noticed this phenomenon. Most of the thousands surrounding me pressed into one another’s backs, navigating a cluttered horizon of heads and shoulders. Meanwhile, only a handful of people were stopped. They looked like oracles, standing still in the moving crowd, their faces upturned. I craned my neck and joined them, my eyes climbing rungs of innumerable birds. We were the lucky ones.

<li>&quot;We could see nothing but cloud. I could only just see Melissa. The mist had blown in exactly as we reached the summit. On a clear day, we would have seen 100km across the plains of los Llanos. ******************** wisdom Melissa was happy. She always was in the mountains. Despite her slightness and her pretence of helplessness (carefully cultivated, I suspected), Melissa was tough. A survivor. She took what life threw at her and came up smiling. Shed bounced back from serious illness and heroin addiction and unfaithful partners.&quot;[Mann, Mark *The Gringo Trail*. 2001.]</li>
<li>&quot;“Everything you see out there is mine. You&#x27;d never know we&#x27;re so close to the center of one of the world&#x27;s busiest cities. ” “No,” I agreed, “you really can&#x27;t tell. ” He pushed the button again, and the screen climbed into the ceiling. The projector fell silent behind me, and light rose from several wall sconces. I looked through the window, and it was true: I couldn&#x27;t see anything beyond the edges of Mr. Crane&#x27;s garden. I could make out the shimmer of water far off without a roofline or streetlight between, and I took that water to be the ocean, all the way on the other side of the city, but after all he&#x27;d just told me, how could I be sure?&quot;[Himmer, Steve *The Bee-Loud Glade*. Atticus Books, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;But as they sped toward the light at the end of the tunnel, Doc could see an illumination rising up from behind them, reflected on the backs and shoulders of the others. He looked back and saw a roiling, riotous mass of shifting color filling the chamber and rushing at them, felt its obscene heat speeding toward them. Fire, fire made up of flares. “Tina!Enid!” Cal shouted, not slowing. Christina concentrated, and her aura intensified, spread out to enclose them. Enid grabbed up his guitar from around his back and began playing for all he was worth, incredible, gorgeous riffs of power.&quot;[Zicree, Marc *Magic Time: Ghostlands*. Harper Voyager, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;Its buildings ablaze with colour, light leached in late luminescence, Angee wondered when and if he would see Xiamen again. ‘And now the day is gone,’ Lok See finally spoke, ‘I can’t read it either!’ Angee laughed. ‘You win, Uncle. ’ 15. HYDROPHOBIA ‘CLOSE YOUR EYES and tell me what you hear,’ Lok See said quietly. Angee could hear the voices of men talking quietly a small distance away, too quietly to make out the words. ‘What else?’ Angee heard the creak of wooden planks on vessels rocking on the swell; the chop of waves spilling on sand.&quot;[Donnelly, John *The Tao Of Shepherding*. 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;“Tomorrow see for sure. ” “Is not here the first place they’d look?” And, even as he said this, the dreamer turned up its face until it seemed to stare directly at them. Harry could hardly keep himself from ducking back below the parapet, though in that light and through the dense canoe birch, it was impossible they could be seen. “Come up here on hill no good in dark. Maybe we have gun. Maybe more us here. Men don’t know. Tomorrow Walewid see track, make plan. We go in night. ” “But where?&quot;[Whitehead, Harry *The Cannibal Spirit*. Hamish Hamilton Canada, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;And out from the fire billowed a pillar of smoke, gray and thick, and I swear, I swear, it towered so high it fell back down on itself and from the light of the fire I could see the shape of a thick gray mushroom in the sky. It was biblical, missy, and it devoured everything what was in its orbit, everything and everyone, everything and everyone but one. A shadow what I swear I saw climb out from the center of the fire and appear to me for just an instant against the surging orange backdrop of flame.&quot;[Knox, Tyler *Kockroach: A Novel (P.S.)*. 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Kulg could not believe his ears. It was the order to fall back. Lurra raised her eyes to the horizon, taking note of the columns of smoke in the distance, of the craters and swarms of invading hostiles as far as the eye could see. She met her mate’s gaze and they shared a moment of perfect understanding. There was no purpose in retreating. They would fight together until their last breaths. What remained of the defense force was desperately trying to make it back to the illusion of safety that the city gates represented when a meteor careened right into the structures, sending rubble into the lines of soldiers and killing several.&quot;[Amber Fallon [Fallon, Amber] *TV Dinners from Hell*. Fresh Pulp Press, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;What crop were they protecting from marauding eyes, what precious bounty?And could her stolen treasure be part of it?She could see, far below in the valley, the jeweled fairylight of the town, and even at this distance could discern that the steady illumination was not wood nor candle nor oil light, but electricity, pure and simple. Oh, there were mysteries to be revealed. . . . They closed upon the phantom corpses now, the ghastly sprawled obscenities. The horses drew back, eyes rolling. “Easy now, my Brave One.&quot;[Zicree, Marc *Magic Time: Ghostlands*. Harper Voyager, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;“Look around you,” the voice was saying, “and see how late it is. Look and see the world ending in corruption and lust and man’s indifference. ” The suggestion seemed knowing. If you looked out at the suburb, you would see the littered walkways where nobody walked at night except addicts and muggers and drunks. There was better elsewhere, Bright told himself, and managed to turn his head on its stiff neck toward the portrait photograph. “Can you want the world to end this way?” the priest demanded. “Isn’t it true that you wish you could change it but feel helpless?&quot;[Skipp, John, and Craig Spector *Book of the Dead*. Mark V Ziesing, 1990.]</li>
<li>&quot;The darkness was less intense, more enjoyable. Moonlit nights were wonderful, particularly at the time of the full moon when everything was bathed in its silver light and we could see clearly. It seemed as if the only patches of darkness were the shadows cast by the moon. It was magical. I never strayed far from the hut without Hauke or the dogs, as it was often impossible to see far when snow flashed past in the turbulent winds. But twice a day, just before breakfast and again in the afternoon, we would make ourselves go outside, whatever the weather, and exercise.&quot;[Tieche, Marie *Champagne and Polar Bears: Romance in the Arctic*. Summersdale Publishers, 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;The house, with its open windows and brightly-coloured heads poking out, was just like a large cage of goldfinches. The owners of all these heads were trying to see something very important that was happening on the roof. This was just as impossible as trying to see your own ears without a mirror. These people who wanted to see the roof of their own house used the crowd below as a mirror. Those on the ground could see everything, they were shouting and waving their arms. Some were overjoyed, others were terribly angry.&quot;[Olesha, Yuri *The Three Fat Men*. 1969.]</li>
<li>&quot;It had obviously been a very large house, a positive mansion. They could now see that about a quarter of the original roof had been destroyed. The blackened and charred beams told their own story of the fire. Ryan wriggled cautiously to the edge, peered down and saw that the building had originally been four stories high. &quot;Lots trees,&quot; Jak observed, lying flat on his stomach alongside Ryan, the chill wind tugging at his fine white hair. It was a fair comment. As far as Ryan could see the house was surrounded by a rambling forest, reminding him of his own birthplace back in the blue-topped Shens of Virginia.&quot;[Axler, James *Deathlands 09 Red Equinox*. Gold Eagle, 1989.]</li>
<li>&quot;Something else?Another survivor?Dean craned his neck and pushed his blast goggles up into his hairline to make sure he could see as well as possible. It was then that Dean’s pupils be-  50 gan to fluctuate in size and his stomach threatened to surrender its precious pudding. Because, as Dean looked skyward, he saw a great chariot of fire and aboard that chariot, the shape of something like a man. Trumpets sounded, a terrible multitude of them, a great shrieking air raid that threatened to cave Dean’s eardrums had he not shielded them with chocolate-streaked hands.&quot;[III, Carlton Mellick, Jeremy Robert Johnson, John Edward Lawson, D.

<li>&quot;They were blurry around the edges, and Anya could see light surrounding them. Ciro was surrounded by a white shimmer that flickered like a lightbulb almost ready to go out. When she came close to him, she could nearly hear it buzzing. Katie stood arguing with the others, blooming a serene turquoise flame. Jules was gesturing and saying something beside her, surrounded by a shining gold light that Anya found oddly comforting. Max hummed beside him, crackling in an orange-gold energetic flare.&quot;[Bickle, Laura *Sparks*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The face of science as currently construed is a face that only a mathematician could love. The root meaning of “science” is “knowledge”; to see and to see truly, a qualitative, not merely quantitative, understanding. For an example of science in the whole and wholesome sense read Thoreau’s description of an owl’s behavior in “Winter Visitors. ” Thoreau observes the living animal in its native habitat, and watches it for weeks.&quot;[Abbey, Edward *The Best of Edward Abbey*.

<li>&quot;Morning delights. A sense of freedom emerged. I could do anything today – I could stay in bed if I wanted; drive to Berlin; take the overnight train through Switzerland. I could, I could, I could . . . Possibility became a drug. Bold and innocent, I felt it could lead me anywhere. So I let it. IN THE heat of that first European summer I found myself moving north to Edinburgh. Summer, strong and sunny, did not last for long. It burst in full bloom as I arrived, then retreated just as quickly. There was a sharp month of autumn when leaves turned crimson and shed into piles knee-deep.&quot;[Mathieson, Kate *Ways to Come Home*. Ventura Press, 2017.]</li>
<li>&quot;After a while I could sense more than see an outline of something against the forest. The shape was constantly shifting, like tree leaves in a breeze. I could make it look however I wanted. “Yes, I see her!” I said to Heidi. With a voice of rustling leaves, Telonferdie began to tell us an ongoing story that always picked up where it left off the last time. It was woven of the details of the day-to-day—the names of animals and plants and the little worries in our hearts—together with the greater knowledge of the world that flows through all our brains.&quot;[Coleman, Melissa *This Life Is in Your Hands: One Dream, Sixty Acres, and a Family Undone*. Harper, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;They were perhaps ten yards away, close enough to hear the measured pattern of the women’s breath. Behind all that blood, the shreds of muscle and fat, Sarah could see they were beautiful. You could fall in love even as you were being ingested. ‘We’re not going to make it,’ Nick said. His eyes were egg-large. Snot was smeared across his upper lip. He was running just ahead of the girls, whipping his head around to look over Sarah’s shoulder every few seconds. Just as she was sure she could feel the hot sweet breath on her skin, the ghost of swiping fingers millimetres from purchase, someone wailed sorrowfully off to their right.&quot;[Williams, Conrad *The Unblemished*. Virgin Books, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Then Charley looked again toward the fire. “Go look but stay quiet now,” he said. “All right. ” Harry lurched along next to him, feeling the sweat on his forehead, under his arms, pouring down his thighs out of his crotch. Yet he was cold as well, shivering as if he had the watch in an arctic gale. Now they were no more than fifty yards from the fire. Here and there, clumps of high rushes rose above their heads, breaking their view. But Harry could see there was a tall ancestral pole with what looked a battered, weather-beaten image of a killer whale at its top, lit from below by the fire, which gave it a baleful look.&quot;[Whitehead, Harry *The Cannibal Spirit*. Hamish Hamilton Canada, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;The gap I&#x27;ve been entering through for almost as long as I&#x27;ve had the garden, since the brambles were allowed to grow up around it. Back then I could see it from a long distance, and now some days I have to feel my way along the bush for the gap. Their tent filled the space like a dam on a river, and I stood outside its rustling, rippling fabric walls, frozen by the surprise. There are other gaps where I might have entered the garden, at least there were when I could still see well enough to look for them, but this was the one I&#x27;m used to, part of my routine.&quot;[Himmer, Steve *The Bee-Loud Glade*. Atticus Books, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;From my perch on Papa’s shoulders I could see the fire pit glowing in the dusk and knew that soon the chords of a guitar would join the stars twinkling above. Screaming in delight, I held tight to Papa’s ears and tightened the grip of my legs around his neck as he flew me across the farm and home for dinner. “Your father has the confidence of a natural athlete,” Skates always told us in that complimentary way reserved for the most important attribute a person could have. It was a confidence you couldn’t help but love.&quot;[Coleman, Melissa *This Life Is in Your Hands: One Dream, Sixty Acres, and a Family Undone*. Harper, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;Sparky hopped along beside her, with the little salamanders springing like grasshoppers behind them in the gravel and pieces of green slag. After what seemed like hours, a now-familiar rumble echoed in the distance. Anya moved to get off the tracks, calling for Sparky and the salamanders. She could feel the vibration in the metal. Charon stood on the tracks. “We can catch the train from here. ” Anya blinked stupidly. “On the tracks?” She could see the train lights in the distance.&quot;[Bickle, Laura *Sparks*. 2010.]</li>
