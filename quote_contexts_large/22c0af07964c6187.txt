Selected: To simplify this text analysis the author has obtained a computerized version of the three catechisms. 1 This includes a reverse-order dictionary, a word-frequency dictionary, an item-locating dictionary listing every separate word with its specific location in the texts, and a search capability that can produce a list of all words in the texts with any desired sequence of letters. Of course this does not yield any information that was not available earlier by counting, but it saves considerable time.[(Ed.), Anders Ahlqvist *Papers from the 5th International Conference on Historical Linguistics, Galway, April 6–10 1981*.

02. "Harris’s integrationist theory of writing provides a vigorous solution that manages to clearly tease writing apart from the transcription of speech, which is just one of writing’s possible uses. Instead, writing is (re)aligned with spatial configurations in general (Harris, 1995). Postcard From Tunis presents an integrationist exploration of writing and its possible transformations at the human-computer interface. Pictures are not dominated by writing, as is so often the case in language learning and elsewhere, but instead the two are treated as complementary facets of one integrated form of communication, that is, spatial communication."[Toolan, Michael *Language Teaching: Integrational Linguistic Approaches (Routledge Advances in Communication and Linguistic Theory)*. 2008.]

03. "I had a chance to dabble in machine translation and information extraction. My interest in speech synthesis, and in particular the problem of how to get computers to read from ordinary text, got me interested in the question of how text actually represents language, and thus how writing systems work. The present book is in many ways a synthesis of a wide variety of areas that it has been my good fortune to work on over the years. The book also grew out of a course that I developed during my five and a half years at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which was called ‘Language, Technology and Society’."[Sproat, Richard *Language, Technology, and Society*. 2010.]

04. "", excluding temporal reference as a structuring device, suggesting either an object-oriented organization or a structure which follows the spatial organization of the picture. The characteristics of the first text segment with respect to the referential movement correspond to what has been said for descriptive texts. The referential fillers show properties typical for this text type: the time reference is unspecified, and the predicates are all unbounded states. At the end of text CI the same picture emerges again."[Dietrich, Rainer, and Carl F Graumann *Language processing in social context*. North-Holland, 1989.]

05. "The longest text, the IPSL rendition of a theatre play, is seven minutes long whereas the shortest texts only consist of a few signs. Besides the passages reproduced in the main part of this book there is a longer coherent text transcription from the data in Appendix A. During the interviews I tried on the one hand to touch upon as many different topics as possible."[Zeshan, Ulrike *Sign Language in Indo-Pakistan: A Description of a Signed Language*. 2000.]

06. "Internet Relay Chat), instant messaging (ICQ, Yahoo!Instant Messenger), and graphical modes incorporating typed asynchronous and synchronous text (Second Life, Active Worlds). 1 These new modes of writing have spawned an academic specialty among linguists, sociologists, anthropologists, and communication researchers of ‘interactive written discourse’ (Ferrara et al. 1991), ‘electronic language’ (Collot and Belmore 1996), ‘Netspeak’ (Crystal 2006), or, most commonly, computer-mediated communication (CMC). 2 Compared to speech and to pre-digital writing, digital writing is, paradoxically, both doubly attenuated (diminished) and doubly enhanced (Figure 8. 1). 3 Digital text is attenuated because it lacks materiality."[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

07. "require a temporal sequencing. To summarize, a coherent text, produced as an answer to a question, involves a referential movement within various semantic domains—we shall say here domains of reference—such as persons, place, time, and others. This referential movement is reflected in the use of specific linguistic devices such as, for example, the use of anaphoric elements rather than indefinite noun phrases, and in the choice of a particular word order, intonation contour, etc. We can now state the main thesis of this paper: The structure of a text is constrained on both global and local levels by the nature of the question which the text in its entirety is produced to answer."[Dietrich, Rainer, and Carl F Graumann *Language processing in social context*. North-Holland, 1989.]

08. "1, London: Hutchinson) Figure 2. 3 Academic cockroach text. It might initially be difficult to see how and is being used grammatically in the two texts as a coordinator. Using a concordancer, where all the instances of and can be stacked on top of one another, the difference is easier to see (Figure 2. 5). Viewing the concordance lines, one can see more readily that and is used mainly to link phrases in the academic text and mainly to link clauses in the conversation. Are these typical texts with regard to and?"[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

09. " EXPRESSION AND CONTENT � 59  i   contains in itself an expression-form and a content-form. The    first stage of the analysis of a text must therefore be an analysis I  into these two entities. To be exhaustive, the analysis must be  so organized that at each stage we analyze into the parts that    i. e. , of  lowest number, either within  are of greatest extension,  the analyzed chain in its totality or within any arbitrary section    of it. If a text, for example, includesboth sentences and clauses,  we can show that the number of clauses  is greater than the nummust not proceed directly to an  ber of sentences; therefore we  analysis into clauses, but first analyze into sentences and then  analyze the sentences into clauses."[INPUT: Hjelmslev__Prolegomena_to_A_Theory_of_Language.pdf]

10. "3. 2 KEY CONCEPTS TEXT AND DISCOURSE A text can be defined as any stretch of language which forms a unified whole, whether spoken, written or electronic. In a railway carriage, for example, you might be exposed to language such as: Alarm. Lift flap & pull handle. That’s all right, I’ll just get the Met. Any tickets from Stockport?Spurs on the slide as Butt posts late winner. Between London Euston – Manchester Pi. No, I’m on the train. Such disconnected scraps of language do not form a coherent whole and therefore do not constitute a text."[Maybin, Janet, and Joan Swann *The Routledge Companion to English Language Studies (Routledge Companions)*. 2009.]

11. "It is also accepted that the discourse structure can be exploited in different natural language processing applications, such as summarisation, machine translation, natural language generation. Thus, research has been carried out to produce systems that automatically chunk discourse into segments and assign them labels according to some theory of discourse acts, the discourse parsers. Many of these attempts have been based on the recognition of the internal structure of discourse (see Kurohashi & Nagao 1994; Asher Lascarides 1993), but they failed to produce reliable results, especially with real texts."[Van Sterkenburg, P. G. J., and Republique tcheque International congress of linguists 17 Prague *Linguistics Today: Facing A Greater Challenge*. 2004.]

12. "All the texts I have used instruct the reader how to prepare foods, drinks, or medications. The texts in my corpus are from 6 different points in time between 1300 and 1600. On the basis of their phonological, morphological and lexical features, they have all been characterized as originating from the Flemish-Brabantish area, in other words from the northern part of Belgium. The texts have been dated by means of a variety of criteria: data about authors, printers, historical events described in the text, data about the manuscript, and phonological and morphological features."[(Ed.), Anders Ahlqvist *Papers from the 5th International Conference on Historical Linguistics, Galway, April 6–10 1981*. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1982.]

13. "To my mind, the most unfortunate instance of this (as also noted in Chapter 3) is the use of the term ‘ideograph’ to refer to Chinese characters (the usage goes at least back to Becker’s original Unicode88 proposal). Thus one can Wnd many references to ‘CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) ideographs’ (or ‘Han Ideographs’) in the Unicode literature. The ideographic myth surrounding Chinese characters has now, by act of committee, become part of the permanent lexicon of text technology. But complaints aside, electronic text technology has changed the equation for the mechanical input of text."[Sproat, Richard *Language, Technology, and Society*. 2010.]

14. "The crucial question is: how typical is this example for the overall pattern of aspect use across Slavic?In order to abstract away from individual instances, the procedures outlined in Section 2. 2. above were applied: all nonconsistent examples were coded in a matrix of contexts intersected with language versions of the text and the overall differences between these versions were aggregated into a distance matrix. This was visualized in a neighbor net graph, shown in Figure 4. A further graph, shown in Figure 5, is based on Explorations into variation across Slavic: Taking a bottom-up approach 305 Figure 4."[Szmrecsanyi, Benedikt, and Bernhard Walchli *Aggregating Dialectology, Typology, and Register Analysis*.

15. "Three such factors are briefly considered here with reference to our data matrix M. 4 A third data issue is increasingly recognised in data processing research generally: data nonlinearity. The NECTE data matrix M has been found to be substantially nonlinear (Moisl and Jones 2005), and current work is investigating the implications of this (Moisl 2007).
