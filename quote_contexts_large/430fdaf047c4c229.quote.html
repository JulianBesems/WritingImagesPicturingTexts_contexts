<li>&quot;Second, on the way out from the cottage one would be able to pause within the thickness of the wall to assess the weather. Third, it is within the thickness of the wall that greetings and farewells would be made. Fourth, as a friend entering without waiting to be allowed in, one would have time to call ‘hello’ as a warning before intruding.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>

<li>&quot;Physicists have disputed the nature of light since the earliest times, but Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was the ﬁrst to recognise that white light is a mixture of coloured light that can be separated by refraction: this led to his corpuscular theory that light was a stream of bullet-like particles.&quot;[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;The entrance of Wright’s Rosenbaum house is the meeting place of the domestic realms of day and night. Admittance and Defence If there is need for a wall (to keep things in or out) then a break in that wall in the form of a doorway is a point of weakness. Robert Frost’s poem ‘Mending Wall’ (1915) contains the lines: ‘Before I built a wall I’d ask to know What I was walling in or walling out, And to whom I was like to give offence. ’ An equivalent test can be applied to the wall’s counterpart, the doorway; we only need to invert the ideas in Frost’s lines: Before I built a doorway I’d ask to know What I was allowing in or allowing out, And from whom (or what) I was like to need defence.&quot;[Unwin, Simon *Doorway*. Routledge, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Hundreds can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see. To see clearly is poetry, prophecy, and religion – all in one’. Christopher Le Brun When Caspar David Friedrich claimed that, ‘The artist should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within himself. If he sees nothing within himself he should also forgo painting what he sees before him …’, he not only captured the essence of Romanticism; he also posed a fundamental question with which art has been concerned ever since.&quot;[*The Architectural Review - Sellection  2002-2005* 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;In this same document he changed his professional designation, and therein lies a tale almost as interesting as his name. No longer an orafo, he is now a maestro di intaglio, a master carver, which we would call a sculptor. This is how Donatello had identified himself for over twenty years, and this is how Filippo’s surrogate son Buggiano identified himself.&quot;[Walker, Paul Robert *The Feud That Sparked the Renaissance: How Brunelleschi and Ghiberti Changed the Art World*.

<li>&quot;In the evening, facing in the general direction of north, an astronomer-priest would observe the passage of the stars across the sky. He would mark the wall where a given star first rose above it. Later that night, he would mark where the star disappeared behind the wall. The midpoint between these two points is north. This observation could be repeated many nights with different stars to obtain an exact reading for north. 31 Another astronomical method of determining north has recently been suggested.&quot;[Brier, Bob, and Jean-Pierre Houdin *The secret of the great pyramid : how one man&#x27;s obsession led to the solution of ancient Egypt&#x27;s greatest mystery*.

<li>&quot;18 A major milestone was reached in 1998 when a conference on light held at Reading University in the UK brought together delegates, lecturers and practitioners from many parts of the world to disseminate their latest studies. They exchanged information and techniques on light, photo medicine, the use of lasers, polarised light, strobes for bio-stimulation and a ‘colour puncture’ system using selected colours beamed on to acupuncture meridian and pressure zones.&quot;[Saunders, Thomas *The Boiled Frog Syndrome: Your Health and the Built Environment*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;This chapter sets out to show how the general appearance of our towns and cities has changed over the years and how, if carefully and responsibly carried out, the relentless tide can be turned. 4 The introductory quotation shows how an impression of the past can be gained by studying the written word.&quot;[Forsyth, Michael *Materials and skills for historic building conservation*.

<li>&quot;Each approaches it with his or her professional interest and concerns to the forefront. Whereas an architect might focus on how structure impacts the surrounding space, an engineer will most likely perceive structure as facilitating a load-path. So, my architectural analyses of structure, or structural readings, inevitably reflect who I am and includes my structural engineering background, my experience of teaching in a school of architecture and my intense interest in how structure can enrich architecture.&quot;[Charleson, Andrew *Structure As Architecture: A Source Book For Architects And Structural Engineers*.

<li>&quot;ŧ VnI. Now, let the reader simply ask himself how, on such a surface, he would set about building a substantial wall, that should be able to bear weight and to stand for ages.

<li>&quot;But where do human beings fit into this picture?The first insight we had related to light.
