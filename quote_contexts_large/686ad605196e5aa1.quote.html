    <h2>Search text used</h2>
    <pre>- in context of books: The smallest text entity we will work with is the word on its own. In a way the word vectorisation is the same as the book TF-IDF matrix, just rotated, and normalised differently. However we will not work or rely on this encoding of the words within the 1_1m_vocab.
- context of paragraphs: The same goes for the words within the paragraphs. Here the words are also the rotated matrix of the paragraphs. These encodings are used as it allows the search for closest relevant alternative words if a word from the writing input does not occur in the film dictionary. Therefore we do consider the operations on the level of words within the paragraph domain in order to facilitate this.
- In a similar fashion to the paragraphs we have extracted all subtitles from the 215 films introduced earlier. Because we&#x27;re not working with the actual material of the subtitles as sections, but interested in how the subtitles together give shape to the text domain within the multi-modal corpus of films, the subtitles as a whole are not maintained as separate elements (which would sit at a similar level to the paragraphs). However the words occurring within the subtitles form the primary elements by which we will speak about the textual concepts within the multi-modal corpus. So where the primary role of words in the other text domains is to form the dimensionality for the documents, here the documents form the dimensions for the words.</pre>

      <li>&quot;*Each encoding opens a different spectrum of possible decodings. These encodings don’t define what a text is but provide the ground for a specific context and its articulations. The measurement becomes part of the encoding process. It translates into a cypher open to many articulations and, in effect, opens a communication channel.* [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=324&amp;annotation=Q4HJ78JE)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Under the guise of reverting to a previous arrangement, it recovers its three functions-but in order to pervert them, there­ by disturbing all the traditional bonds oflanguage and the image.* — **This exactly expresses how text and image cannot in all situations be expressed in the same encoding. Because this subversion is only possible because image and text stand to each others proportion but not in one another&#x27;s encoding.** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=34&amp;annotation=SDLNYAT5)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Again, this small play was taken place with-out imposing any predefined and external categories on books.* — **Question of categorisation of things through context is useful. Could evolve in the vectorisation of activated SOM. Another inversion by shelves of new and current things. Might be conceptually relatable to the renaissance study of astronomy (ludger piece in coding as literacy)** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=370&amp;annotation=ZT8EKUYM)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The context shapes the resources available for meaning making and how these are selected and designed.* — **Check article by xy? In coding** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=269&amp;annotation=RVVZVLII)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*reshapes the relationship between resources such as image and writ-ing, and has the potential to significantly reconfigure notions of spatiality and embodiment as well as genre conventions, all of which can lead to adapted and some new types of texts and interactions.* — **Key!!!** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=270&amp;annotation=WA8NIH6S)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*An Informational Instrument celebrates these contradictions without having an explicit a priori base unit. It opens a different perspective. What if the emphasis is not on measuring reality but on encoding and decoding it in many ways, by crafting different keys to access the world in many ways? What if it is about articulating faces and mixing libraries? It is a different game then. You are not looking for specific properties to measure, but are trying to develop a communication channel through which you can articulate profiles of different encodings. This is the search for the most general and abstract ingredients in a given situation. There is no base unit of a book. Yet, in a Plentiful Play books are profiling libraries from many perspectives simultaneously. A book becomes a constitutive part of a character of an alphabet that articulates its library—a symbolic void element* — **Interesting to relate to groups, rings, and bodies** [9783035624052.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/USF7AJIK?page=308&amp;annotation=4WBUS9PP)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*There is a large body of multimodal research that explores the dynamics of the interaction between image and language.* — **Interesting but to me it seems to fall into the same pitfalls where meaning is seen as a singularly defined unifying mapping of the modalities. However this fails to acknowledge that the modalities need to remain in their domain to bear this meaning. This collapsing them and studying them by means of analysing meaning seems odd to me. However further and closer reading is needed.

Primary argument is that our approach is an active one where it navigates domains to put something forward which inherently relies on a different approach where this research is employing an analytical method to study how understanding is derived from multimodal sources . (Analysis vs Algebra?)** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=275&amp;annotation=7RJ5TVJQ)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*Lemke noted (2002: 303) ‘No [written] text is an image. No text or visual representation means in all and only the same ways that text can mean. It is this essential incommensurability that enables genuine new meanings to be made from the combinations of modalities’.* — **-this is exactly the right way of putting it compared to earlier sentence** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=272&amp;annotation=KAHF5HK6)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*From the calligram that says things twice (when once would doubtless do); from the calligram that shuffles what it says over what it shows to hide them from each other* — **Very relevant for clip embedding and how text and image say the same thing without added content.** [Foucault - 1983 - This is not a pipe.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBBEEFM8?page=36&amp;annotation=4AEDDZBS)&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;*The meaning of any message is, however, distributed across all of these modes and not necessarily evenly.* — **Set based approach. This I have issue with. Either mode can rely on the other in order to bear meaning** [Jewitt - 2013 - Multimodal Methods for Researching Digital Technol.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8HD6N5JS?page=272&amp;annotation=8PZ2MLY3)&quot;</li>
