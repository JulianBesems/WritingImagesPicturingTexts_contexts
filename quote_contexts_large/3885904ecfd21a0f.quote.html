    <pre>This theoretically aligns with the contribution WIPTe presents: embeddings and statistics furnish the numeric substrate for proportion; limits are composed architecturally so relations become legible constraints rather than untraceable scores. In concrete terms, equality appears as duplication and mirroring across modalities; measurement as commensuration within textual and visual traces; proportionality as tuned correspondences that hold unlike things together in workable ratios. The situated cast shows this in practice. By setting an authored selection against a large, generic field, the cast turns vague categories into live concepts. An umbrella, seen through Studio Ghibli, becomes a Ghibli umbrella: an object with narrative, weight, and gesture. It means that a concept can stop being an abstract noun and start behaving like something with a particular weather, pacing, and atmosphere. The umbrella example is telling precisely because it is banal: once the umbrella passes through a cast of Ghibli films it ceases to be a generic token and becomes a specific one, a Ghibli umbrella,

<em>The same process unfolds with the concept of &#x27;city&#x27;. Initially, it means a sprawling metropolis with skyscrapers, streets, and traffic; but through the cast of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s films, it transforms into a Miyazaki city: a place with winding canals, ancient forests, and a sense of community. The city ceases to be a mere urban infrastructure and becomes a specific, cinematic entity. This recontextualization of the familiar not only highlights the agency of the author but also underscores the power of the situated cast in shaping our understanding of the world.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;We all know that Tokyo is a polynuclear city; it has several cores around five or six centres. We must learn to Roland Barthes 163 differentiate semantically among these centres, which, in fact, are indicated by railroad stations. In other terms, even in this sector, the best model for the semantic study of the city will be provided, I believe, at least at the beginning, by the phrase of discourse. And here we rediscover Victor Hugo’s old intuition: the city is a writing. He who moves about the city, e. g.&quot;[Leach, Neil *Rethinking Architecture: A Reader in Cultural Theory*.

<li>&quot;As attention to detail (of construction, of connections and linkages, etc. )takes precedence over the quest for a coherent, rationalised and planned totality, the apparent chaos that the aerial view of the Japanese capital conveys actually belies its concealed order and intrinsic urban life. THE IMAGINARY OF REFORM This radical vision that marked the aerial view was also active in reflections on how the city might respond to – and be transformed by – aerial mobility. For the city seen from an aeroplane was also that assemblage of artefacts that were, from the earliest days of aviation, the projections of urban thinkers.&quot;[Dorrian, Mark, and Frédéric Poussin (eds.) *Seeing from Above: The Aerial View in Visual Culture*. I.B.Tauris, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;Even when the movie depicts recognizable areas of the city, they are not celebrated as formal wonders. In this sense, The Bicycle Thief is the inverse of Berlin. The social condition of the city is the primary concern, and images of the built environment are the supporting materials of the discourse. Building Movies In the history of cinema, movies devoted to speciﬁc buildings begin to appear in the middle of the 1920s, at around the same time as the ﬁrst city symphonies. There is not, however, a prehistory of the building movie genre that is comparable to that of the city movie genre in the early years of the medium.&quot;[Forget, Thomas *The Construction of Drawings and Movies: Models for  Architectural Design and Analysis*. Routledge, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;And yet, the relationship between city and subject cannot be explained in terms of cause and effect. As though affect were no more than an effect. Allowing subjectivity to emerge as a question—one that is always placed—requires the narrative of the city to move beyond mere description. While cinema and the novel may already know this, architectural configurations of the city often remain unmoved. What has to be allowed therefore is that place and the process of placing are locations of work. Being is, after all, an activity.&quot;[Benjamin, Andrew *Writing Art and Architecture*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;It is significant that the theorists of the city, rather than emphasize this contradiction, attempt to hide it, or rather to resolve it by dissolving the city in the great sea of Nature and focusing their attentions entirely on the city’s superstructural aspects. Urban naturalism, the imposition of the Picturesque on the city and its architecture, and the emphasis on landscape in artistic ideology, all served to negate the now manifest dichotomy between urban and rural reality, to pretend that there was no gap between the valorization of nature and the valorization of the city as a machine for producing new forms of economic accumulation.&quot;[Hays, K. Michael *Architecture Theory since 1968*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;In a number of works, Breton uses Paris both as a backdrop and as an active participant in the narrative. The city is a great playground where unusual intersections of people, objects, and places become the basis for a narrative structure that reveals an otherwise invisible dimension to the city - an intermingling of individual and collective narratives. The city of dreams is a fictional city that sustains and is sustained by the verifiable city of appearances: &quot;Fever-cities traversed in every direction by women alone, abandoned cities, cities of genius too, whose buildings had animated statues on top, whose freight elevators were built to resemble human beings, cities of sorry storms, this one more beautiful and more fleeting than the others, all whose palaces and factories were in the form of flowers: a violet was a mooring for boats.&quot;[Perez-Gomez, Alberto, and Stephen Parcell *Chora 1: Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture*. Mcgill Queens Univ Pr, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;Although certain post-modern cities (Tokyo for example) might be characterised as fully three-dimensional fields, the prototypical cities of the late 20th century are characterised by horizontal extension. What these field combinations seem to promise in this context is a thickening and intensification of experience at specified moments within the extended field of the city. The monuments of the past, including the skyscraper – a Modernist monument to efficient production – stood out from the fabric of the city as a privileged vertical moment.&quot;[Carpo, Mario *The digital turn in architecture 1990-2010*. Chichester: Wiley, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;68–80. Chapter 3 Porosity at the edge Working through Walter Benjamin’s ‘Naples’ Andrew Benjamin What is that identifies a city?Where is the feeling or sense of that identity located?Could that sense of identity – no matter how it was discovered – be generalized?The encounter with a city endures within attempts to articulate that experience within writing. Equally, an encounter with a specific city – once it admits the possibility of generalization – may become productive within design. Walter Benjamin continued to work through the city. 1 The modern and the urban coincide.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;The number of buildings and shops in Orchard Road stands as testimony to the realization of Raffles&#x27;s vision of a &#x27;bustling emporium&#x27; (Jayapal, 1992: 67). A city is therefore &#x27;man&#x27;s single most impressive and visible achievement&#x27; (Pike, 1996: 243) while remaining nonetheless a &#x27;social institution&#x27; (Mumford, 1996: 184). A city or a &#x27;built world, like a written text, stores information&#x27; and &#x27;presents particular transformations and embeddings of a culture&#x27;s knowledge of itself and of the world&#x27; (Preziosi, 1984: 50-51).&quot;[O&#x27;Halloran, Kay L. *Multimodal Discourse Analysis: Systemic Functional Perspectives (Open Linguistics)*. 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;The ground itself becomes a sculpture: a variable curvature outside of any vector. Territorial politics must now go through a series of readings, in the same way as the richness of a population is measured by the breadth of its gene pool. It is an art of the passage from one reading to another for our audiovisual times. Fortunately, cinema has no more stories to tell, which means that it can find images in things. A monument will be able to stand on film when a productive cinema will accede to the primary image: a new geographical possibility, our response to the Earth. Such was the promise of Godard&#x27;s short film on Lausanne. 1. &quot;Sloped city, crest city, perched city, valley city&quot;: these four urban figures form a typology borrowed from a local historian, Charles Biermann. 2. Le Corbusier also reduced modern architecture to five fundamental elements: the flat roof, stilts, elongated windows, the free facade, and the free plan. 3. Decried as the symbol of Communist architecture, the flat roof often raises, from the point of view of construction, as many problems as it solves, nor is it the sign of the advent of a Communist society.&quot;[Cache, Bernard *Earth Moves: The Furnishing of Territories (Writing Architecture)*. The MIT Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;The city emerged by comparing different forms of “subjective” maps rather than through a structural approach that assumed an ideal or normative form before the planning process and evaluation commenced. In these studies, therefore, perception was conceived of as a channel or a process, if we will, with a temporality. The study states that cities are “of vast scale, a thing perceived only in the course of time. ” City design, the study concludes, is a “temporal art,” and experience is a matter of pattern recognition and manipulation.&quot;[Halpern, Orit *Beautiful Data: A History of Vision and Reason since 1945*. Durham and London: Duke University Press Books, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Far from vying for the creation of a specific typology, the architects who made the aerial theme their own set in motion a structural transformation of the urban environment. It is therefore not the airport that emerges, from the beginning, as the main material and spatial figure of the intersection between aerial mobility and the urban environment; rather, it is the city, or better yet the city of the future, this finally plausible abstraction that the conquest of the air seemed to make real. 25 AN AUTONOMOUS WORLD Similarly to the cities planned from above, the ‘aerial cities’ traversed by airships and structurally transformed in order to accommodate them raised the question of the tenuous distinction between a totalising and a totalitarian vision.&quot;[Dorrian, Mark, and Frédéric Poussin (eds.) *Seeing from Above: The Aerial View in Visual Culture*. I.B.Tauris, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;City symphonies investigate urban built environment and force viewers to interpret the meaning of the city, and variations within the genre, such as the two examples discussed here, raise a profound question: is the city primarily a built environment or a social environment?More 193 The Construction of Drawings and Movies speciﬁcally, are cinematic depictions of the city primarily documents of a formal condition or vehicles of social change?Ruttmann treats the people of the city mostly, albeit not entirely, as anonymous elements of texture and pattern within the great urban machine.&quot;[Forget, Thomas *The Construction of Drawings and Movies: Models for  Architectural Design and Analysis*. Routledge, 2012.]</li>
<li>&quot;An event, as the fundamental component of a narrative, may be defined as a happening or occurrence, however banal or monumental, an intersection of trajectories in real or fictional space. Therefore, the city may be understood as a collection of stories that have been recorded and continue to be written over time. The city becomes analogous to a book, a repository into which events are written. Architecture is vital to the recording and writing of the narratives of the city.&quot;[Perez-Gomez, Alberto, and Stephen Parcell *Chora 1: Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture*. Mcgill Queens Univ Pr, 1994.]</li>
<li>&quot;And, yet, that coincidence brings with it more than a simple equivalence. Cities have a past. The modern contains vestiges. The question of the city – if only as a beginning – concerns that complex presence. In a text that demands consideration not just because of its content, but equally due to its actual design – Einbahnstraße – the presence of the affective city, the city as the place of experience endures. 2 A brief entry under the heading ‘Freiburg Minster’ opens a possible interplay between the particular and the related move to a form of generality.&quot;[Hartoonian, Gevork *Walter Benjamin and architecture*. London, New York: Routledge, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Reconfiguring, as opposed to reform, operates by charging and changing the given. These considerations already indicate the theoretical dimension implicit in Goodwin’s city projects. Central to them is that they depend upon the city of Sydney. And yet, the necessity inherent in the work’s relation to Sydney has nothing to do with parochialism. The projects implicate Sydney. Theory and place double the sense of implication. Taken together they disclose—though only ever as a site of continual interconnection—four sites of implication.&quot;[Benjamin, Andrew *Writing Art and Architecture*. 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;Drawing on Foucault’s critique of power, de Certeau finds in walking a form of resistance to distanced and privileged ways of visualising the city as a unified whole. 11 Unlike Baudelaire, de Certeau refers to walking as a mass practice: the ‘“wandering of the semantic” produced by masses that make some parts of the city disappear while exaggerating others, distorting it, fragmenting it, and diverting it from its immobile order’. 12 It is the ‘forest of gestures’ produced by the walking of the many that opposes the immobility of the city.&quot;[Awan, Nishat, Peter Blundell-Jones, and Mark Meagher *Architecture and movement : the dynamic experience of buildings and landscapes*. London and New York: Routledge, 2015.]</li>
<li>&quot;Furthermore, it can be observed that architecture’s urban discourse and tradition of the city preserves the character of effects within its 120 Architecture for a Free Subjectivity models of urbanism and urbanity (the latter the locus of the ‘urban subject’). Indeed, recently the image of the city has been broadly theorized as an anonymous field for the production of effects.&quot;[Brott, Simone *Architecture for a Free Subjectivity: Deleuze and Guattari at the Horizon of the Real*. Ashgate Publishing, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;As a corollary to the concept of founding, within the context of this discussion, is the notion of the destiny of the city and its attachment to the forming of city. The founders of the Open City believe and state that the “role of the urbanist is to discover the destiny of the city and position it in space so that the city and its inhabitants live their destiny”. Destiny is not something to be imposed upon the city but allowed to unfold through time and space. It is, however, present within the city from its very founding.&quot;[Read, Alan *Architecturally Speaking: Practices of Art, Architecture and the Everyday*. 2000.]</li>
<li>&quot;From the fence to the screen, by way of the rampart’s stone walls, the boundary-surface has been continually transformed, perceptibly or imperceptibly. Its most recent transformation is perhaps that of the interface. The question of access to the city, then, should be asked in a new way: Does a greater metropolis still have a facade?At what moment can the city be said to face us?The popular expression “to go into the city,” which has replaced last century’s “to go to the city,” embodies an uncertainty regarding relations of opposites ( the vis-a`vis and the face-a`-face ), as though we were no longer ever in front of the city but always inside it.&quot;[Hays, K. Michael *Architecture Theory since 1968*. The MIT Press, 1998.]</li>
<li>&quot;Maybe a more instructive reading might be a city after wireless communication. The meaning of the city has been altered by the pressures that electronic communications have exerted on the public realm. Things which used to have a public physical presence are becoming invisible, transformed into activities conducted privately and individually. The contemporary city is riddled with intricate confusions of public and private, fragmented desires and needs – a strange cocktail of collective meanings and individual assertions that recalls Robert Venturi’s remark, ‘Americans don’t need piazzas: they should be at home watching TV. ’ Communication technology carries content that supersedes its urban incarnation.&quot;[Rattenbury, K. *This is Not Architecture: Media Constructions*. 2002.]</li>
<li>&quot;Among the urban planners proper there is no talk of signification; only one name emerges, rightly so, that of the American Kevin Lynch, who seems to be closest to these problems of urban semantics in so far as he has been concerned with thinking about the city in the same terms as the consciousness perceiving it, which means discovering the image of the city among the readers of this city. But in reality the studies of Lynch, from the semantic point of view, remain rather ambiguous; on the one hand there is in his work a whole Rethinking Architecture 160 vocabulary of signification (for example, he lays great stress on the legibility of the city and this is a notion of great importance for us) and as a good semanticist he has the sense of discrete units; he has attempted to identify in urban space the discontinuous units which, mutatis mutandis, would bear some resemblance to phonemes and semantemes.&quot;[Leach, Neil *Rethinking Architecture: A Reader in Cultural Theory*. Routledge, 1997.]</li>
<li>&quot;This formalist history of Lausanne should suffice to put into question the notion of urban identity. For far from expressing the &quot;nature&quot; of a place, the identity of a city is eminently variable and assumes the most diverse forms. In the case of the city of Lausanne, at least four distinct figures can be counted: 10 11 • the perched Cite, • the city of the Bourg crest, • the city of the valley that stretches along the Flon, • the city of the Leman slope surrounded by the Ceinture Pichardo For each of these urban identities, a geometrical figure can be drawn: a cone for the perched city, an inclined prism for the crest city, a dihedral for the valley, and a plane that stretches toward the lake for the sloped city.&quot;[Cache, Bernard *Earth Moves: The Furnishing of Territories (Writing Architecture)*. The MIT Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;The urban model implicit in these essays is Deleuze and Guattari’s reformulation of capital and their vision for a decentralized subjectivity, or “rhizome,” but here concretized into specific questions of how the shifts in urban, economic, and social realities after 1968 reformulate the city vis-à-vis the emergent neo-liberal economy of the late 1980s. 44 This attempt to rework the previous discussion brings about an important modification of the thinking of the city—specifically, it suggests a semi-abstract urban subjectivity as opposed to the personalized explorations of sex, gender, and psychoanalysis in Semiotext(e).&quot;[Brott, Simone *Architecture for a Free Subjectivity: Deleuze and Guattari at the Horizon of the Real*. Ashgate Publishing, 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;(Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities, 1972)1 Sometimes I feel that our physical experience of the city is less clear and comprehensible than the image or idea of the city. The complexity of cities makes them difficult, if not impossible, to fully understand. We prefer, instead, to understand their images. We favour a city constructed not from brick, stone and glass, but from memory, association and history.&quot;[Davies, Colin, and Monika Parrinder (auth.) *Limited Language: Rewriting Design: responding to a feedback culture*. Birkhäuser Basel, 2010.]</li>
