Selected: The intention of this work is to apply the conceptual framework of natural communication in the domain of architecture. By means of communication bridges between different domains, the resolution of a problem unsolvable within architecture will be presented as the resolution of a matching problem in its conjugate symbolic domain. The solution can then be decoded back to architecture. — Relevant to the discussion on domains Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf

02. "*In this respect, content and expression could be seen as two different domains giving form to each other. The process of formalisation could be seen as a form of communication.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=184&annotation=26A4N5IC)"

03. "*The same structure models different subjects by training with different data* — **A multiplicity of the domain which is specified through an abundance of context.

05. "*The point-by-point correspondence of the solid volume and its delineation, ichnography or scenography, makes the latter a characteristic or a language; conversely, language establishes a correspondence of the same type as the painting - one then understands the deformations and avatars of the former, if one observes that the projection can be made on a left surface, or 'humpbacked'.* — **Very relevant!!!!!** [02.a. en (gpt) _premier chapitre_ deuxième partie [Serres, Michael_Le système de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2W5WUQWU?page=7&annotation=EDC3Y77T)"

06. "*The Monadology, then, is ichnography: the methodological profile (as we have seen), the gnoseological profile (as we see it), the ontological profile (as we are about to see) of the Universal are superimposed on it.* — **2 Axes, so important!** [02.c. en (gpt) _troisiÃ¨me chapitre_ deuxiÃ¨me partie [Serres, Michael_Le systÃ¨me de Leibniz (2015)].pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CGEFGZ5G?page=48&annotation=2DY9U2AR)"

07. "*dispositio or arrangement, which consisted of ichnography (plan), orthography (elevation), and scenography (perspective). 874 This arrangement was for the first time challenged in the 15th century.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=238&annotation=5C98QELB)"

08. "*In the chapter “An experiment: Communication and natures of architectural representation,” by making an analogy with this example, it will be shown how geometric information of a floor plan can be encoded in an algebraic structure defined with the ring of integers and the field of real numbers.* [Marinčić - 2019 - Computational models in architecture towards comm.pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QXJ9N6IV?page=132&annotation=DRZNHNBI)"

10.
