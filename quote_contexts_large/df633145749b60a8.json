For instance, a selection of 5000 tweets can be used to investigate the role of social media in shaping public opinion. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between different modalities and their influence on the writing process. The writing assistant continues to operate in a multi-modal manner, constantly adjusting the correlation between the modalities to ensure a cohesive and coherent narrative. As the experiment unfolds, the assistant's role evolves, shifting from a curator of correlation to a mediator of meaning, weaving together diverse sources to create a rich tapestry of knowledge.  </assistant>", "suggest_context": "3.1 OUTLINE - The text editor operates in a multi-modal manner, constantly both personal and general. - There are different layers of private and public: the private construct of choices and curation facilitates the projection on the common sense - The Scales of the data differs. Therefore the role of the model is here interpreted as the curation and construction of the correlation between the modalities that are facilitated by a chosen set of multi-modal documents. The primary dataset for this is a selection of 215 films which are used as the primary model used to write this thesis. This chapter will describe how this model is constructed and how other modes can be used to establish other biases, which will be demonstrated in the writing of chapter 4. - The purpose of the text editor is manyfold. It is to make the writing of the thesis its own experiment, because if proposing a different way of writing then what better way to demonstrate that in the writing itself? Furthermore it is to form a manner in which the transitions between image and text constant, and volatile while the method stabilises through the demonstration of its use throughout an extensive document. The other aspect is to take the coded out of the coding environment as this is the only way to domesticate its use, for as long as we're engaging with the information in a coded way we are inevitably bound to be engaging with it through the thought of it's high"}
