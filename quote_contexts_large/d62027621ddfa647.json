The internal altitudes within a cell represent the spread or diversity of the conversations that particular cell can accommodate. As shown in Figure 3.4:7, the cell 4250 holds a relatively small number of books, allowing for a more legible spectrum of internal altitudes. The altitudes within a cell can be used to filter the retrieved books to those that are most relevant to the topic of the cell. For example, in the case of cell 4250, books with altitudes close to the mean altitude of the cell are likely to be more representative of the topic than those with altitudes far from the mean. This approach allows for a more fine-grained retrieval of relevant books based on their proximity to the topic of interest. The internal altitudes can also be used to identify clusters or groups of books within a cell that share similar characteristics. This can be seen as a way to uncover hidden patterns or relationships between the books and the topic of interest.*", "suggested_query": "The activation of a cell can be seen as a snapshot of the conversation or topic that dominates that region of the SOM.
