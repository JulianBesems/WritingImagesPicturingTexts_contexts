      <li>&quot;I knew better than to mention that to my strict Christian mother. But I loved music and craved it, especially Bo Diddley, Motown, and salsa. I often danced in front of my mirror for six hours at a clip. Diddley had fused a 3-2 clave with rhythm and blues, and rock and roll. A Bo Diddley beat was a clave-based motif, clave being the name of the patterns played on two hardwood sticks in Afro-Cuban music ensembles. This syncopated accent on the “off beat” was perfect for the click-and-slip of my pelvis as I bopped around my bedroom dance floor in my early teens.&quot;[Rowlands, Penelope *The Beatles Are Here!: 50 Years after the Band Arrived in America, Writers, Musicians &amp; Other Fans Remember*.

<li>&quot;I baptized myself in Parisian blood. Felt glamorous history in the air, got to know the vivid legends: Josephine Baker becoming such a decadent, amoral diva, dancing the Charleston at the Folies Bergère in the 1920s, wearing a banana tutu designed by Jean Cocteau; the cabaret, the glorious excess of the nightlife; the honking, sizzling Paris jazz; the boys dressed as girls; the dazzling dancing girls loving to show themselves off and be treated as artists, not tarts. The great French singers Jacques Brel, Juliette Gréco, Édith Piaf, and Serge Gainsbourg were all melancholy and melodramatic romantics, but also geniuses at representing erotic sensuousness through music.&quot;[Jones, Grace, and Paul Morley *I&#x27;ll never write my memoirs*.

<li>&quot;“Oooh!Don&#x27;t get worked up, darling,” drawled Juana as she buttoned up her shirt, did another seductive move, and blew a kiss at Sanjana, who rolled her eyes. It was Juana who had choreographed the entire song. Sanjana and Suvi helped with the costumes. The dancers wore smart soldier costumes complete with all details including the caps worn by the U. S Army Corps. The song they had chosen was a old popular wartime song. The underplayed sensuality, the uniforms, the props, the well chosen piece of music and the superbly coordinated dance movements made the whole scene look like it was right out of a movie.&quot;[Shenoy, Preeti *Life is What You Make it: A Story of Love, Hope and How Determination Can Overcome Even Destiny*. westland, 2014.]</li>
<li>&quot;Elvis shaking his hips on TV was the first to put the baby boomers on heat. ‘Rock &amp; roll’ was old blues slang for sex. Shake Some Action, by the Flamin’ Groovies, is one of my favourite expressions of teenage lust. The love song was pop music’s safer lingua franca, and the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Phil Spector, and the Brill Building and Motown hit factories were all masters.&quot;[Stafford, Andrew *Something to Believe in*. Original retail. University of Queensland Press, 2019.]</li>
<li>&quot;There is no sense of danger anymore. Everything has been turned into pleasure, euphoria, the ecstasy of seeing the laws of nature crumble before your eyes. PART THE FOURTH After the final somersault, I glide back to my position at the center of the stage, seven feet off the ground. The music stops. A triple spotlight is thrown on me: one red, one white, one blue. The music starts up again: a stirring of cellos and French horns, loveliness beyond measure. The orchestra is playing “America the Beautiful,” the most cherished, most familiar song of all.&quot;[Auster, Paul *Mr. Vertigo*. Penguin Books, 1995.]</li>

<li>&quot;It was always the last song to play on the mix CD that traveled with the band from city to city. (Small rituals. )When the Ramones’s track faded, the lights went out and another solid, wall-like wave of painful white noise rolled around inside the hollow venue. “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” composer Richard Strauss’s piece of crescendo-building classical gas, played on the crowd’s communal suspense. In the twentieth century, the composition had become a sort of sound track for pomposity (Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey), disco smarm (it was a big hit for Brazilian instrumentalist Deodato), and the bloat of Fat Elvis’s white jumpsuit years.&quot;[Spitz, Marc *Nobody Likes You: Inside the Turbulent Life, Times, and Music of Green Day*. illustrated.

<li>&quot;The other class was the “soces” or “doopers,” which stood for “Dear Old Oak Parkers. ” They usually wore jeans with madras shirts and penny loafers. They liked folk music and folk rock, artists like Dylan and The Mamas &amp; the Papas. Since they usually got good grades, they were college bound. I dressed like a greaser most of the time, minus the baggy grays and the T-shirt. For the upcoming sock hop we were going to play at, Randy would be wearing a letterman jacket with real leather sleeves, so I wanted one too.&quot;[Cain, Jonathan *Don’t Stop Believin’: The Man, the Band, and the Song that Inspired Generations*.

<li>&quot;It was an odd reaction: When I was a boy I read these lyrics on the back of the album as grail, whereas now, dressed up in white-tie, they seemed to have lost their poetry. Published formally, the words of Sgt. Pepper no longer looked excitingly Now; they looked very Then. During earliest moody youth, most records entered my system for a while; I had a favorite song for various humors—an up song, a down song, a daydreaming song, a rebel song—and I memorized them all.&quot;[Rowlands, Penelope *The Beatles Are Here!: 50 Years after the Band Arrived in America, Writers, Musicians &amp; Other Fans Remember*.

<li>&quot;“Those patterns have to do with consciousness,” Maynard would explain. “They clearly have to do with art and music and how your body reacts to their structures. When artists figured out this mathematical proportion thing, they created paintings that vibrate in us at more powerful frequencies. The same with classical music. Beethoven could barely hear. He wrote music based on math, and that music makes you cry. ” Even synchronicity and coincidence, Melchizedek explained, are natural and expected expressions of mathematical order.&quot;[Jensen, Sarah, and Maynard James Keenan *A Perfect Union of Contrary Things*.

<li>&quot;When the authorities come to arrest him, he drowns himself in a water hole, and then haunts it for all eternity. (Actually, given its darker themes, perhaps AC/DC should do a cover of that song themselves. )We decided to do “Waltzing Matilda” on the last show of the tour. There was no rehearsal, just me, a music stand, and our musical director on piano. He played, I interpreted, and the crowd ate it up. I really played up the drama of the song, and got to wrap my melodious diction around the following Australian words: Swagman Billabong Jumbuck Coolibah I have to say that “billabong” and “coolibah” were my favorites, and I really .&quot;[Shatner, William *Shatner Rules: Your Guide to Understanding the Shatnerverse and the World at Large*.

<li>&quot;. . and it all came together, in one room, on one floor, under lights that flashed for life, and became disco. It became Let’s go to the disco, and in the disco there were DJs making music as much as playing it. Before it was called disco, there were simply dance spaces, party rooms in downtown warehouses and borrowed places over the bridges and through the tunnels out of Manhattan. Lots of places where music you could dance to would be played, creating a demand for a certain sort of venue playing a certain sort of music.&quot;[Jones, Grace, and Paul Morley *I&#x27;ll never write my memoirs*.

<li>&quot;The monkeys also can build a suspension bridge out of wood chairs and rope, make a four-tier champagne fountain, and write their names on a whiteboard. The monkey show is very popular, with a schedule of 127 shows this year at fairs and festivals across the Midwest and Great Plains.

Good Walkout Songs (Honorable Mention) “Use Somebody” by the Kings of Leon. Great opening. Great buildup. Great song. “Girlfriend” by Matthew Sweet.

<li>&quot;The costume couldn’t have been more basic: a white shirt open at the collar, loose black trousers, and a pair of white dance slippers on my feet. The white shoes were essential. They had to jump out at you, to create the greatest possible contrast with the brown floor of the stage. With only twenty minutes to work with, there was no time for costume changes or extra entrances and exits.&quot;[Auster, Paul *Mr. Vertigo*. Penguin Books, 1995.]</li>

<li>&quot;His job was to store various sequences of prefabricated music (violins, for example) which had been programmed. Then computers would work the sequences into the music played by the musicians onstage. With Paul&#x27;s keyboards, drums and the strings and woodwinds added by the sequencers, the sound was smooth, rich and modern. Celine celebrated her seventeenth birthday on the stage of Le Carrefour college in the northern Quebec city of Val d&#x27;Or. In a little over two months, she gave thirty-six performances in twenty-five cities in Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick.&quot;[Germain, Georges-Herbert *Celine: The Authorized Biography*.

<li>&quot;It’s my most natural rhythm, and I came up with a bass line for his poem, inspired by the jagged edges of Basquiat, and the song “Defunkt” by the band Defunkt, an awesome avant-funk band from NYC led by Joe Bowie, brother of Lester Bowie, he of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. We used to rock out so hard to “Defunkt” at Skood’s, go into a dancing frenzy when it played, whirling and dervishing our way into the land of the free. Defunkt was ingrained in our psyches. Our friend Gary Allen was playing a gig at the Grandia Room, and asked if we would get something together and open the show for him.&quot;[Flea, Patti Smith *Acid for the Children: A Memoir*.

<li>&quot;He was a bit over six feet tall, with darkstraight hair and a generous straight nose and brown horn-rimmedglasses. He reminded Caroline of a large, earnest bird. He wore agray flannel suit that was almost black, a white shirt with a tightlittle round collar and a collar pin in it and a narrow black knitted 132 tie. The suit was obviously expensive, and the collar pin lookedlike real gold.&quot;[Jaffe, Rona *The Best of Everything*. Penguin Books, 2005.]</li>
<li>&quot;I asked her for a song that never failed to move her, and she nominated Running Up That Hill. Like much of Lorde’s music, it’s actually quite simple, relying on stacked vocal arrangements and that thundering beat for impact. Lorde said it was minimal but cavernous, not a song you’d be content playing in the background at low volume. Bush is a mistress of the middle eight, the bridge of a song that introduces a new melodic idea (usually after the second chorus and before an instrumental break). On both Running Up That Hill and the title track, it symbolises her surrender to desire: a wish to be held down and ravished.&quot;[Stafford, Andrew *Something to Believe in*. Original retail.

<li>&quot;And the show went on. The higher-ups at MTV especially wanted a talent and variety show, wherein contestants could show off their strangest skills, scored to the hits of the day. (And the stranger and more dangerous or repulsive the skill the better, this being the dawn of Jackass. )As with The Gong Show, a panel of celebrities would judge these performances. And should they deem one especially awful, they would pull a chain, activate a sound effect, and the act would be removed from the stage while the audience chanted the show’s title: Dude, This Sucks.&quot;[Holmes, Dave *Party of One: A Memoir in 21 Songs*.

<li>&quot;The Olympia is a legendary show business venue, where Celine performed for five weeks. Her show includes a mascarade, with public participation, in which Celine disguises herself as a flamenco dancer. At sixteen, Celine was already an established star in Quebec and France. Chapter Thirteen In the Land of the Rising Sun O ne September evening around dinnertime, Eddy Marnay called from Paris to say that the song &quot;Tellement j&#x27;ai d&#x27;amour pour toi&quot; had been selected to represent France in a big international contest the next month in Japan.&quot;[Germain, Georges-Herbert *Celine: The Authorized Biography*.

<li>&quot;Forty, indeed!“All four of us on the first dance!Come on, Annie. ” Lizzy grabbed her hand and they ran down the bleachers like little mountain goats headed for a watering hole. The band geared up with Gretchen Wilson’s “Redneck Woman. ” “Seems fitting,” Julie said, as they walked up to the girls on the arena floor. Annie and Lizzy each grabbed one of her hands and one of Griffin’s and began to wiggle and dance, moving as though they had no bones in their little bodies and giggling all the while. Julie stood to one side and moved with the beat of the music but spent more time laughing at the girls than she did actually dancing.&quot;[Brown, Carolyn *Getting Lucky*. 2010.]</li>
