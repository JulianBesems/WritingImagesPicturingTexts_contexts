    <h2>Search text used</h2>
    <pre>Crucially, no attempt is made to collapse one channel into the other; adjacency is staged, not asserted as equivalence. Later chapters will mobilise this material to derive figurative concepts that orient image search and composition across the generic domains, while keeping the multi-modal gap intact. INSERT LIST OF FILMS 2. PDF A second corpus turns to PDFs with substantial figurative content. In contrast to film, these documents are denser in text and comparatively sparse in images, and they often organise images diagrammatically or editorially rather than cinematographically. This difference is intentional: it tests the instrument under a textual regime in which images are fewer but often more pointed. Here there is less of a personal view in the selection of the specific documents than with the films, but rather these data collections aspire to demonstrate the ability to foster projections tuned to a specific discourse. Two collections are used. 1 AA Files  1,247 articles from the Architectural Associations AA Files 19812012. The journals writing sits between research discourse and design language, with images ranging from photographs to drawings and diagrams. The mix of image types yields a distinct figurative register that contrasts with film stills and PD12M imagery. 2 ETH Zurich PhDs  a set of 500 dissertations, of which 200 are used here because they exceed a 50-image threshold. The intent is to model the content of these theses, but to exploit their image density and disciplinary heterogeneity to probe how the instrument behaves when images are embedded in long-form argument. And of course in this thesis it serves as a play in which we can explore how peers have proportioned image to text in the past. As with film, co-presence is preserved without forcing alignment: page-level or figure-level positions allow projection, but captions, figure numbers, and paratexts are not operationalised as descriptive truth. The documents are treated as image-rich textual fields whose figurative moments can be cast into the generic IMAGE domain and back toward TEXT . 3. PHOTOGRAPH WITH STORY The final corpus constructs multimodality deliberately by placing two distinct datasets into relation: a vocabulary of Roald Dahls stories and the scenographic imagery of Tim Walker. Here, the two channels are not inherently coupled; instead, one domain serves as a cast through which the other is projected. The wager is that single images, treated as documents in their own right, carry sufficient figurative depth to sustain projections across domains when held in tension with a narrative lexicon. Methodologically, this corpus demonstrates that the instrument is not limited to inherently multimodal sources like film or illustrated PDFs. Cross-casting can be staged by selecting a textual vocabulary on one side and a curated image set on the other, then proportioning them through the same generic screens. This manufactured adjacency underscores the central claim: projection precedes equivalence and can be made personal without becoming arbitrary.

<em>The latter half of the chapter will elaborate on the technical means by which this is achieved, but for now, it suffices to note that the resulting projections are not mere aggregations of text and image, but rather novel entities that exhibit emergent properties at the interface between the two.  In this regard, the instrument is less a tool for information retrieval than a medium for generating new knowledge through the strategic alignment of disparate cultural artifacts.  The remainder of this chapter will explore the implications of this approach for our understanding of the relationship between language and image in contemporary culture.  It will also introduce the reader to the specific technical infrastructure that enables these projections, and describe the various corpora and datasets that have been used to test the instrument&#x27;s capabilities.</em></pre>

      <li>&quot;It seems clear, therefore, that everyday language is bound up with two different traditions: one the tradition of linguistic communication (which requires an attention to the functionality of information), the other the tradition of information technology focused on processes of transforming, coding, and decoding. These telecommunicative processes have a structure, but that structure does not have to be linguistic, meaningful, or capable of being true or false.

<li>&quot;I will now analyse the difficulties faced by library and information science (LIS) when it comes to constructing a user-friendly system for mediating electronic documents – especially for information retrieval (IR) – by applying the cognitive information processing paradigm. The main problem with this paradigm is that its concept of information and language does not systematically address how social and cultural dynamics determine the meaning of those signs and words, which are LIS’s basic tools for organizing and retrieving documents.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd. University of Toronto Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;This kind of work cannot be done without an ongoing dialogue between metatheory and specific theory, especially in the information, cognition, and communication sciences. When there is an ongoing dialogue with the aims and forces of technology, development is unavoidable. In establishing a new framework, I also hope to create a third culture, one that transcends the incommensurability between C. P. Snow’s two cultures: science-technology, and the humanities and social sciences.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd. University of Toronto Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;I hope this book will inspire other LIS researchers to take a new approach to the problems they work with, and I encourage feedback. Recto Running Head 425 12 Summing Up Cybersemiotics: The Five-Level Cybersemiotic Framework for the Foundation of Information, Cognition, and Communication 12. 1 Introduction The result of preceding analysis of cognitive science, information science, the information processing paradigm, the cybernetic information paradigm including Bateson, second order cybernetics, ethology, and library and information science document retrieval problems is this: it does not seem possible to establish a foundation for a transdisciplinary information science without relating it to theories of cognition, communication, mind, and meaning that span the humanities and social sciences on one hand, and the classical sciences and a theory of evolution on the other.&quot;[Brier, Soren *Cybersemiotics: Why Information Is Not Enough!*. 2nd. University of Toronto Press, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;The resulting focus on language as a sequentially ordered practice has increased the appreciation of CA and EM. However, in spite of these insights, information is still usually treated as something that has existence in its own right—that social things are done to and with—that existing independently, information also comes to have a social life. Garfinkel, by contrast, has since 1952 treated information as almost entirely dependent on constitutive social elements for its existence. The classic examinations of the intersection between language and information by Shannon, Weaver, Bateson, etc. , that Garfinkel makes creative use of in this manuscript, date from just before and after the second world war.&quot;[Garfinkel, Harold, and Anne Rawls (ed.) *Toward a Sociological Theory of Information*. Paradigm, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Translation between different message formats and languages is another use for information systems, and not only human language. Computation is now used universally to turn physical motion into commands, through transducers like the mouse, touchscreens, motion sensors, etc. Automated human language translation is, of course, embedded into a sizable fraction of the software we use on a daily basis. This brings us to a third aspect of information associated with infrastructure, which is learning. Learning offers the possibility of escaping the constraints of scale, i. e.&quot;[Burgess, Mark *In Search of Certainty: The science of our information infrastructure*. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2013.]</li>
<li>&quot;We add the category of “inferential information” as a possible modifier of primary and secondary information. The term distinguishes between information that stands as the product of a message and information obtained by the communicant’s processes of inference. While the information obtained from a message may be viewed as related to the message through a set of “coding” or “transforming” rules whereby the signal and its referents are matched, it is also possible to obtain information from what one learns directly from the meanings of the message by a chain of judgments whereby sets of meanings other than those meant through the message are implicated with the meanings of the message.&quot;[Garfinkel, Harold, and Anne Rawls (ed.) *Toward a Sociological Theory of Information*. Paradigm, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;I have in mind &quot;conceptual role semantics&quot; (Harman 1982; Loar 1982; Loewer 1982; Block 1986), &quot;correlational semantics&quot; (McLaughlin 1987), &quot;information-based semantics&#x27;&#x27; (Fodor 1988), and &quot;interpretational semantics&quot; (Cummins 1989). I object to the practice of using the term &#x27;semantics&#x27; in this dual way on the grounds that it promotes a conflation between two aspects of representation that should be distinguished.&quot;[Von Eckardt, Barbara *What is cognitive science?*. MIT Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;For Garfinkel it is not only words but objects that are “thingified” through use. Any referential relationship between the two would need to come after this social process—in each case. “We know the thing information,” Garfinkel maintains (113), “through usage. We’re looking for the ideas that are immanent to the concept of information in use. ” The problem has been in treating information, like meaning, in abstraction—as a thing in itself.&quot;[Garfinkel, Harold, and Anne Rawls (ed.) *Toward a Sociological Theory of Information*. Paradigm, 2008.]</li>
<li>&quot;Information, by allowing us to organize, track, and sequence objects and actions, can help us overcome many constraints. Information itself, of course, has a cost, and can therefore also act as a constraint, a factor we will also explore. New technology may incorporate information, such as in computer controlled fuel injection in cars, or may result from the substitution of new materials or processes (which of course is also the result of new information produced by experimentation). In the sections that follow, the role of constraints in different domains is explored in the context of the roles of information and new technology in overcoming these constraints.&quot;[Loehle, Craig *Becoming a Successful Scientist: Strategic Thinking for Scientific Discovery*. Cambridge University Press, 2010.]</li>
<li>&quot;One might disambiguate the above situation by making the representation of the hate relation more specific. That is, one might introduce one node for Art-subject-hates-Ike-object, one node for Art-subject-hates-Neal-object, one node for Fred-subject-hates-Ike-object, and one node for Fred-subject-hates-Neal-object. Then when one wanted to represent that Art hates Ike and Fred hates Neal, one would activate only the first and the fourth of these nodes rather than the second and the third. But, as Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988, p. 24) so aptly put it, this proposal &quot;requires rather a lot of microfeatures [i. e.&quot;[Von Eckardt, Barbara *What is cognitive science?*. MIT Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;There “is” also information as opposed to knowledge, as opposed to wisdom, as opposed to data, as opposed to experience, information more or less “raw” and more or less “processed. ” There are, in sum, informations, various interlocking concepts that come together in partially stable information regimes, each of which collocates a set of terms, a set of ideologies, and a set of goals that determine its articulation of the concept and its attendant words.&quot;[Janich, Peter, Eric Hayot, and Lea Pao *What Is Information?*. Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2018.]</li>
<li>&quot;In contrast, information-processing capacities of the sort referred to in the combined linking assumption (or what I shall refer to as &quot;narrow information processing capacities&quot;) are purely mental, involving a transformation from one mental representation to another. Because of this difference in scope, the identification between ordinary input and output capacities, on the one hand, and Page 304 Figure 9. 1 How the human cognitive capacities, as ordinarily construed, map onto the human information-processing capacities.&quot;[Von Eckardt, Barbara *What is cognitive science?*. MIT Press, 1995.]</li>
<li>&quot;Sarkar provides us with an introduction to Shannon–Weaver information theory, and then develops an alternative account of information. He argues that genes code for proteins directly, and hence indirectly encode information for phenotypic traits. Peter Godfrey Smith attempts to understand the metaphors by contrasting the actual mechanism by which genes affect phenotypic traits with alternative possible mechanisms. This leads him to conclude that it is appropriate to talk of genes encoding information for protein molecules, but not for anything “higher up” than that.&quot;[Hitchcock, Christopher *Contemporary Debates in Philosophy of Science*. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub, 2004.]</li>
<li>&quot;Both in academia and in the popular imagination, our sense of this new life with and as information, this intensification of informational life, seems to stem from a series of recent technological transformations—most prominently the rise of digital methods of information encoding, compression, storage, and networking. But “information” can also be understood as a matter of human concern for far longer, dating back to what Michael E. Hobart and Zachary Schiffman call the earlier “information ages” characterized by the development of writing (in Mesopotamia, 3500 b. c. e. )&quot;[Janich, Peter, Eric Hayot, and Lea Pao *What Is Information?*.
