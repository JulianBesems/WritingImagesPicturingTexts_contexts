Selected: There is another possible book that contains all that is not in this one. In that book, other habits take center stage, other unfamiliar experiences are recorded, and the jokes are told all the way to the end. That book’s disadvantage, though, would be its exclusion of what is published here. It would omit these gathered experiences in favor of others. That other book might have a different tenor: it might perhaps be more critical in tone, be more analytical in approach, contain more argumentative opinion.[Cole, Teju *Known and strange things: Essays*.

Thus the Posterior Analytics is not to be read as an essay in scientific methodology, but rather as an attempt to characterize the notion of an axiomatized deductive science as a model of how teachers should present and impart knowledge. On the other hand, scholars like Le Blond and Owen have stressed the importance of the role which dialectic was made to play in Aristotle's theory of the discovery of the first principles of science. 82 They pointed out, moreover, that the so-called doxographical surveys by which Aristotle prefaced many of his philosophical discussions should also be viewed against this background."[Algra, Keimpe *Concepts of space in Greek thought*.

11. "The question is thus: whether beyond the empirical use of the understanding (even in the Newtonian representation of the cosmos) a transcendental one is also possible, pertaining to the noumenon as an object - which question we have answered negatively. If, therefore, we say: The senses represent objects to us as they appear, but the understanding, as they are, then the latter is not to be taken in a transcendental but in a merely empirical way, signifying, namely, how they must be represented as objects of experience, in the thoroughgoing connectiona of appearances, and not how they might be outside of the relation to possible experience and consequently to sense in general, thus as objects of pure understanding."[Immanuel Kant, Paul Guyer (Editor, Allen W.
