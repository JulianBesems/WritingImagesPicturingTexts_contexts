    <pre>4.1.2 WALL

<em>The walls of the ancient structure were worn and faded, the once-vibrant colors of the frescoes and murals now chipped and peeling away. Despite the passage of time, the intricate carvings and bas-reliefs remained remarkably well-preserved, telling the story of a long-forgotten civilization. As the team leader, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, carefully made her way through the dusty, cobweb-filled halls, she couldn&#x27;t help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the secrets that lay hidden within these ancient walls.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;If Wall 3042 was indeed a Stratum-VIIIA construction, it is strange that there was no clear evidence of a rebuild of Wall 3041 in its upper courses where it bonds with Wall 3042. Within Room 326, beaten earth Surface E65:45 seals up against Wall 3042 and covers a patch of plaster on the south face of the wall.

<li>&quot;This necropolis, brought to near artistic perfection by its builders and craftsmen, is the famous “Saadien Tombs,” sealed off from view until the early-twentieth century. Nowadays indissociable from the qibla wall, the mihrab is commonly a mosque’s most ornate element, located neither before nor behind the qibla wall, but within it. 23 Most frequently in the form of a recessed, arcuated niche, the mihrab is thought by some to signify an absent presence: that of the Prophet as Imam. 24 Ambiguous, because presence and absence at once co-exist, this signiﬁcation draws upon the mihrab’s location within the liminal, equally ambiguous qibla wall. 25 An alternative signiﬁcation, as proposed by Clevenot again, is that of a door inviting the believer to traverse the wall and pass beyond immediate reality. 26 This interpretation, too, draws upon the mihrab’s location within qibla wall, for without the wall, there would be no door for traversal.&quot;[O&#x27;Meara, Simon *Space and Muslim Urban Life: At the Limits of the Labyrinth of Fez (Culture and Civilization in the Middle East)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;PAGE 20 WOVEN WALL The ur-wall is not, according to  19th century architectural theorist  Gottfried Semper, a mud or stone  line of enormous and reassuring  heft, but an artful, woven partition.  Hanging loosely, perhaps flapping,  the woven screen generates-   and, crucially, symbolizes -   the division and organization of  activities within the primitive dwelling. The woven &quot;wall&quot; is an enabler  of civilization; the thick structural  wall merely a defender of it. &quot;[INPUT: wall.pdf]</li>
<li>&quot;Yet, wall C integrates the remains of a remarkable, obviously even earlier structure (Wall C1), most of which had already been destroyed or dismantled when the construction of wall C was started. Here, we get a glimpse of the concepts of a medieval “building in the historical context”. 3. 2 Definition of structural criteria for masonry of wall C1 The question of when Wall C1 could have been built cannot be answered in Baku itself, since no directly comparable constructions or construction techniques have been discovered here so far.&quot;[Le Brun, Nicolas *Building knowledge, construction history. 2 vols.

<li>&quot;There is some damage at the ceiling level where the joists have moved relative to the wall and caused damage to the plaster. This may also be an indication that the wall has moved outward from underneath the ceiling structure. There was very little damage observed to the west exterior wall in Rooms 6 and 7. The east exterior wall is enclosed by a porch that is part of a more recently constructed museum structure.&quot;[Tolles, E. Leroy, Frederick A. Webster, Anthony Crosby, and Edna E.

<li>&quot;37:a). The smaller, inner niche has the same dimensions as that at the south end and also has a hole in the center of the back wall (not shown in Plate 51), but the wall is not standing to a height sufficient to have preservedthe large, shallowly recessedarch above. South of this niche, in the main wall surface,a hole in the wall correspondingto the one in the south wall is cut in diagonally,althoughonly for approximately0. 45 m. White marble revetmentis still in situ on the wall of the smaller niche at the south end, and a fragmentof lapis lacedaemonius is preserved at the north end.&quot;[Biers, Jane C. *The Great Bath on the Lechaion Road (Corinth vol.17)*.

<li>&quot;This wall is the only transverse interior wall that has no central support from a perpendicular intermediate wall and most clearly demonstrates the out-of-plane behavior of slender adobe walls. The north wall of Room 10 has a more complex pattern of cracks, complicated by the central support provided by the intermediate wall between Rooms 11 and 12. This wall is also partially covered by plywood and temporary bracing, which obscured observation.&quot;[Tolles, E. Leroy, Frederick A. Webster, Anthony Crosby, and Edna E.

<li>&quot;The east wall seen by Ittar and Dinsmoor is still visible above the south apse wall (PI. 10:a). At a lower level the original west wall of the area can be seen through the break in the south apse wall.

<li>&quot;This is one ofthegreat myths ofthe Great Wall, so that it is possible to read careless accounts of nomads &#x27;raiding through the Great Wall&#x27;, when no such structure actually existed in the specified location at the specified time.&quot;[*The Great Wall of China 221 BC - AD 1644* 2011.]</li>
<li>&quot;The signiﬁcance of a wall’s threshold qualities notwithstanding, a wall is empirically also a screen, or cover; a function of particular importance to medieval and premodern urban Arab-Muslim culture, with its traditional enclaustration and veiling of women.&quot;[O&#x27;Meara, Simon *Space and Muslim Urban Life: At the Limits of the Labyrinth of Fez (Culture and Civilization in the Middle East)*. 2007.]</li>
<li>&quot;In the context of this chapter, shaping a wall in plan presents opportunities for architectural enrichment, as illustrated at the Mönchengladbach Museum. Highly regarded for the qualities of its interior spaces and urban setting, an exterior gallery wall undulates (Fig. 4. 10). The sinuous wall imbues one gallery interior with special character and outside, the wall’s serpentine geometry appears as a natural extension of the curvilinear paths and brick walls that lead up the hillside to the museum.&quot;[Charleson, Andrew *Structure As Architecture: A Source Book For Architects And Structural Engineers*.

<li>&quot;• At the fa£ade of one building, there was a veneer-clad wing wall above a fourth floor terrace area. This wall was topped with coping stones, with the top of the wall angled downward toward the exterior. There was a concrete beam running along the top of the wall (below the coping and veneer). A coping stone was removed from this wall to observe the anchorage of the coping and the condition at the wall cavity.&quot;[(Editors), Paul A. Bosela 7 Norbert J.

<li>&quot;A structure that in its relief recalls the blood spilt and the familiar patina of bullet-peppered walls.

<li>&quot;A wall-walk (boevoy hod) ran behind a parapet supplied with loopholes.

<li>&quot;The great curved retaining wall and the thinner wall it supported (pls. 16, 1 – 2) were made of bluish gray marble, as were the lower portions of the long stage wall (plan 4) and its terminal piers.
