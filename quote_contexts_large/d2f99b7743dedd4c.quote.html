    <pre>All books are then projected onto the SOM and assigned to a cell. This populated SOM is whosn in Figure 3.4:3. Figure 3.4:3 - Flattened Hammer projection with a heat-map of the projected number of books onto the SOM 1525 is the maximum number per cell, 0 the lowest Figure 3.4:4 - Activations of books in the dataset at indices 0, to 1,100,000 at 100,000 intervals The next step is the reason for using a spherical SOM in this particular instance instead of a toroid. The ambition was to make an ultra light measurement to establish which books should be retrieved, based on first global topic the location on the full som and second the internal cell &#x27;altitude&#x27; of a book. This altitude was determined by fitting a PCA perpendicular to the 300 dimensional surface of the spherical SOM. The idea is that because the SOM is spherical the altitude also gives an impression of genericness internal to the SOM, negative altitude or unusual external to the SOM, high altitude. This approach is the result of an earlier experiment which is included in the appendix. Figure 3.4:5 - Example of an activation by book index 0 and the altitude of that book in each cell of the som. Figure 3.4:6 - Zoomed in altitude mapping on the activated region of the SOM The altitudes within a cell represent the &quot;spread&quot; of the conversations that particular cell can accomodate. An example of the internal altitudes for cell number 4250 is given in Figure 3.4:7. This cell was chosen as a demonstration because it holds a relatively small number of books, allowing for a more legible spectrum. Figure 3.4:7 - Altitudes of the book population of cell 4250 the one including Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami. paragraph For the paragraph level we do not build a unifying structure, but instead rely on a two-tier vectorial search only. This is because of two reasons, first of all the paragraph section itself is of a dynamic nature because it is intended to be changed per chapter in WIPT. Secondly, the search onto the paragraph set is highly volatile because it is the constantly changing writing, so a unifying layer that is able to make a curation of things that represent a broader spectrum like with the books is net desired, instead it forcuses on specific and relevant retrievel to the constantly changing writing. The exact implementation is discussed in 3.6, as it falls under the interaction level of the editor scheme. FIGURATIVE IMAGE For the generic public domain, as mentioned before, the screen takes the shape of a large scale DuckDBSQL database. The elements are retrievable based on the word labels associated to them only. MULTIMODAL Both of the multi-modal screens sit within the dimensions corresponding to the multi-modal documents that make up the domain. For the explanation here we will return to the 215 films described in 3.3.

<em>The altitudes within a cell represent the &quot;spread&quot; of the conversations that particular cell can accomodate. An example of the internal altitudes for cell number 4250 is given in Figure 3.4:7. This cell was chosen as a demonstration because it holds a relatively small number of books, allowing for a more legible spectrum.  The altitudes of the book population of cell 4250 are presented in the figure, with Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami being one of the books included in this cell.  The internal altitudes of cell 4250 are shown in Figure 3.4:7. The altitudes of the book population of cell 4250 are presented in the figure. The books with the highest altitude are those that are most distant from the center of the SOM, while those with the lowest altitude are those that are closest to the center.  This is because the altitude was determined by fitting a PCA perpendicular to the 300 dimensional surface of the spherical SOM. The books with the highest altitude are those that are most distant from the center of the SOM, while those with the lowest altitude are those that are closest to the center.  This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the internal structure of the SOM.</em></pre>

<li>&quot;There is another possible book that contains all that is not in this one. In that book, other habits take center stage, other unfamiliar experiences are recorded, and the jokes are told all the way to the end. That book’s disadvantage, though, would be its exclusion of what is published here. It would omit these gathered experiences in favor of others. That other book might have a different tenor: it might perhaps be more critical in tone, be more analytical in approach, contain more argumentative opinion.&quot;[Cole, Teju *Known and strange things: Essays*.

<li>&quot;The measurement arises from qualitative indications and slowly turns into an incarnate suggestion of the number of boxes needed in a stack to turn Chris’s pizza box into a cube. We have already been to this episode before. It follows the instances in which Chris has fi rst shown how there are different sides to a pizza box (Chapter 4), which then turns into an explanation of what he has to do to turn the pizza box into a cube (Chapters 1–3). Following Chris’s turn in response to Mrs. Turner’s question “what would that box have to have to make it a cube?”, I (R = Roth) utter, “how could you make a cube from pizza boxes?” (turn 24).&quot;[Roth, Wolff-Michael *Geometry as Objective Science in Elementary School Classrooms: Mathematics in the Flesh*.
